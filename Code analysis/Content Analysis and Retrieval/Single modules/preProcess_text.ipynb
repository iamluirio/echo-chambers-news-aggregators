    "Tokenization is a fundamental pre-processing step in natural language processing (NLP) that involves breaking down a text into smaller units, typically words, phrases, or symbols. In the context of sentence tokenization, the process involves segmenting a text document into individual sentences based on certain rules or patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence tokenization is important in NLP because many NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis, machine translation, and text summarization, require input text to be split into sentences so that the task can be performed on a sentence-by-sentence basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to perform sentence tokenization, ranging from simple rules-based approaches to more sophisticated machine learning-based methods. Rules-based approaches use a set of hand-crafted rules to segment text into sentences based on common sentence-ending punctuation marks such as periods, question marks, and exclamation marks. However, such approaches can be prone to errors when faced with complex sentence structures or non-standard punctuation marks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning-based approaches use statistical models to learn patterns from large amounts of annotated text data and apply these patterns to new, unseen text. These methods typically involve training a model on a corpus of text documents, and then using the trained model to segment new text into sentences based on learned patterns."

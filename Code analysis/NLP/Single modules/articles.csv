"Karnataka BJP manifesto committee chief: ‘NRC won’t be announced as soon as govt comes in …We’ll engage experts’ | Political Pulse News,The Indian Express

Health Minister K Sudhakar says, “We do not believe in giving freebies. We believe ‘work is worship’ and we want our youngsters to work and earn their livelihood.”

Karnataka Health Minister Dr K Sudhakar was the youngest Cabinet minister in the B S Yediyurappa government. Sudhakar, who is from the Vokkaliga community, switched from the Congress to the BJP in 2019 and earned plaudits for his work when the Covid-19 pandemic was at its peak.

Sudhakar, who headed the BJP’s campaign manifesto, tells The Indian Express in an interview that the ruling party is not going to introduce Uniform Civil Code or National Register for Citizens (NRC) immediately after returning to power but will set up an expert committee to study it.

It has been well received by all our candidates and I am getting so many responses from the people of Karnataka. In fact, they say it is quite unique because it has put the thrust on empowerment through education, health, and support for women. It presents a 25-year vision for Karnataka. It has a long and futuristic vision like what Prime Minister Modi called for.

We have taken this forward on six principles: Anna (food), Akshara (education), Arogya (health), Abhaya (insurance), Abhivruddi (Development), and Adaaya (economic empowerment). These are the broad principles on which the manifesto was prepared. The idea to keep the campaign’s focus on development has been reiterated.

For example, in addition to 5 kg of rice given under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana, there will be five kg of millet, and half a litre of Nandini milk for families below the poverty line. This is to address, primarily, the undernourished and to take care of anaemic issues among pregnant and lactating women, and children in some districts. We have realised that just giving carbs is not enough, they should get completely healthy food. Unless they are healthy, the state cannot be wealthy.

No one in the country is giving millets like this. This is also a push to promote millet farmers. More farmers will get into it. We will increase MSP for millet growers. There are about one crore farmers involved in milk production. They will benefit as they will get additional support of Rs 2 per litre. Earlier, it is Rs 5. Now, I am proposing Rs 7.

That (response) I gave them (the Congress, which made it an election issue) back.

We do not believe in giving freebies. We believe ‘work is worship’ and we want our youngsters to work and earn their livelihood. They should be self-sustaining and growth should be there. We need to empower them through skills and give them opportunities, not by offering free food or free money.

That is in line with Prime Minister Modi’s Ujjwala scheme. This is to ensure women’s health is paramount. When they use kerosene stoves or firewood, their health gets affected. Secondly, there are environmental issues and the issue of clean energy. If we give three LPG cylinders on various festive occasions, we will be promoting clean energy also.

For the party, there is always an ideology. Both are quite important for the party’s ideology. The party feels it should definitely engage a high-level committee of experts. Let there be one and let them discuss and submit a report to the Cabinet, which can then consider it.

It is a commitment for the country … it is an assurance. In that process, we are only going to engage a high-level expert committee. Let it do an analysis and study.

Not much, but in some pockets we do have problems. The legal course of action will follow. As soon as the government comes in, we are not going to announce NRC. We will ensure that we will form a committee of experts to look into it, we will sit with them, and let them present their report. Then, the Cabinet will discuss its effects and post-effects legally, socially, and scientifically. Then we will take a call.

No, the Chief Minister is quite an experienced and seasoned leader. Our former Chief Minister Yediyurappa ji is undisputedly a popular leader and for the last few decades he led the party in the state. But Basavaraj Bommai is a good administrator. Such issues will not affect the party’s prospects. We are going with Bommai ji as our leader who has the support of Yediyurappa ji.

Who will not be happy if Modi ji can come and address rallies? Everyone, no matter how safe their seat is, wants the PM to come to their constituency. Everyone realises that Modi ji comes with credibility and trust he enjoys among the people. Any programme or rally attended by PM Modi is definitely going to give rich dividends to the party and the candidates.

I do not think so. We are fully vaccinated. But it’s better to follow some precautions. I can just recommend being careful and following appropriate social behaviour such as wearing masks in crowds.

"Express View on BJP’s Karnataka manifesto: High on Hindutva | The Indian Express

Manifestos are usually academic exercises and with just nine days left for polling, this one is hardly the document that can fire the imagination of Karnataka that, by most accounts, is looking for change.

The BJP manifesto for Karnataka polls released Monday is a mixture of Hindutva demands and welfare promises. However, it hardly echoes the aspirational pitch Prime Minister Narendra Modi makes at his election rallies in the state though he has described the manifesto as “development-centric”. Nor does it meet the demands of a state that has been falling behind even among its southern neighbours in human development indices, including for health, education, nutrition etc. Releasing the manifesto, party president J P Nadda said: “Our manifesto is a vision document for a developed Karnataka. It encompasses a forward looking approach and promises to fulfil the aspirations of everyone in Karnataka.” It’s hard to see how. There are the stock promises straight from the polarisation playbook, coming in the wake of the debates on hijab, Muslim reservation etc. As for welfare and development initiatives, they seem more like a response to the criticism that the Basavaraj Bommai government achieved little in office.

On top of the list of promises is a Uniform Civil Code and a National Register of Citizens (NRC). Why would Karnataka, a southern state with no international border, be keen on an NRC considering that the exercise is meant to identify illegal migrants? The party has also promised to set up a panel “to grant complete autonomy of temple administration to devotees”, and regulate “local businesses around temples to create a sustainable temple economy”. The temple economy reference comes in the backdrop of Hindutva groups demanding that the government must “ban” Muslims from running shops on temple premises, or setting up shops during temple fairs. These promises, like the campaign pitch around laws concerning cattle slaughter ban and conversion and Muslim quotas, may resonate among the BJP’s core base. However, these are unlikely to stave off anti-incumbency in the more middle-of-the-road voter struggling with a sluggish economy, lack of decent jobs, and crumbling public infrastructure. The welfare assurances like free LPG cylinders and milk are more of an attempt to account for previous postures. Take the promise of half litre of Nandini milk daily to BPL families under Poshan Yojana. This has the trappings of a defensive gesture since the Opposition had charged — with more rhetoric than fact — that the BJP government planned to merge the state-run Karnataka Milk Federation’s Nandini dairy brand with Gujarat’s Amul. Similarly, the promise of Atal Aahara Kendras to provide “affordable, quality and hygienic food” in every municipal ward is just reiteration of a 2018 item — Annapoorna canteen — that did not take off. The Indira Canteens, set up in 2017 across Bengaluru when Siddaramaiah was the chief minister, are in a poor shape.

Manifestos are usually academic exercises and with just nine days left for polling, this one is hardly the document that can fire the imagination of a state that, by most accounts, is looking for change. That said, the BJP is likely to bank on its formidable organisational clout and resources and, of course, its central leadership’s energy and the PM’s personal push to stave off anti-incumbency. A report card of its five years in office will be what matters — this manifesto is postscript, at best."
"CSK Youngster's Boundary Rope Catch Divides Fans. Watch Out For MS Dhoni's Reaction. Video | Cricket News

Chennai Super Kings youngster Shaik Raseed took a debatable catch in the penultimate over of the match against Punjab Kings. The decision went in CSK's favour, triggering plenty of reactions on social media.

Another drama-filled Indian Premier League (IPL) 2023 match concluded in the last over, with Punjab Kings securing a thrilling victory over Chennai Super Kings on Sunday. The match, went down the wire, with PBKS needing 3 runs off the final ball to win the match. But, the Shikhar Dhawan-led franchise could've sealed the win a little earlier if Jitnes Sharma wasn't dismissed in a debatable manner by Tushar Deshpande on the 4th delivery of the 19th over. Caught while trying to hit a six, there was probably millimetres of distance between the fielder's foot and the boundary rope.With Punjab needing 11 runs from 8 balls, Jitesh hit the ball towards to long-on boundary. Substitute Fieler Shaik Raseed caught the ball but his foot seemed to have touched the padding on the boundary rope.After a lengthy review, the decision went in the favour of the fielding side, with the third umpire suggesting that he didn't see the cushion move. As OUT flashed on the big screen, fans went berserk as many had probably thought that the decision was going against them.What a catch by Rasheed on boundary off Jitesh Sharma. pic.twitter.com/Ftf5tdOEsL— Vikram Rajput (@iVikramRajput) April 30, 2023https://t.co/z2sb18l1pm— sportsfunda (@sportsfunda1) May 1, 2023Dhoni had a cheeky smile on his face when Raseed took the catch, probably thinking how difficult the decision is going to be for the third umpire to make.

LSG vs CSK LIVE Score: The Toss has been delayed owing to a short drizzle. Injury-plagued Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) will aim to bounce back and exact revenge on the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) as they face the four-time champions for the second time in the Indian Premier League 2023 (IPL 2023) on Wednesday. With injuries sustained by pacer Jaydev Unadkat and captain KL Rahul, LSG would be sceptical of CSK’s capacity to recover. In Rahul absence, Krunal Pandya will lead home team. LSG will also be feeling the heat after getting bowled out for just 108 by Royal Challengers Bangalore on Monday after failing to chase down a pitiful score of 126 in their own backyard.

Rahul suffered a right thigh injury when playing here against RCB on Monday, and Unadkat took a horrific tumble while bowling at the nets on Sunday. Rahul entered the game at No. 11 in the LSG run chase and faced three balls.

This season, LSG’s performance has fluctuated dramatically. On the one hand, they have delivered dominant performances that have made rival sides envious, but they also possess a self-destruction button that automatically activates.

LSG may be in third position in the points table with 10 point, but CSK, who also have 10 points but is in fourth due to a worse net run rate, might take advantage of the crushing blow to their psyche following the 18-run loss to RCB.

Although CSK have suffered back-to-back defeats to Rajasthan Royals and Punjab Kings, their capacity to recover should never be underrated. Since most of their victories this season have been a result of Dhoni’s tactical brilliance, the former India captain may take advantage of the circumstance, particularly if Rahul is unable to play on Wednesday.

Devon Conway, the CSK opener, will be highly relied upon once more. Conway has been in excellent form, hitting 414 runs from nine matches at an average of 59.14 and a strike rate of 144.25. Despite Conway smashing an unbeaten 92 to lead his team to 200 for four, it was unfortunate that CSK lost to Punjab as the total was surpassed off the final ball.

Dominant CSK break the Chepauk jinx against MI

For all of Chennai Super Kings' supreme home record, there was a major blip - they hadn't beaten Mumbai Indians at Chepauk since 2010. A staggering stat, given how difficult MS Dhoni's men have been to beat in their den. A collective all-round show from CSK helped them break this jinx with a convincing six-wicket win against MI on Saturday (May 6). The visitors were rocked early after being put into bat and from 14/3, they never really recovered despite an impressive fifty from young Nehal Wadhera. The likes of Suryakumar Yadav and Tristan Stubbs got starts but couldn't kick on. The new-ball pairing of Deepak Chahar and Tushar Deshpande wrecked havoc upfront while CSK's new death bowling in-charge Matheesha Pathirana wheeled away at the death. 140 was never going to be enough and the hosts made short work of the chase.

Scorecard | Report

Pace to win at Chepauk? Really?

It sounds weird and illogical but that's exactly how CSK thwarted to break their venue jinx against their arch-rivals. You'd expect spin to play a major role in Chennai's wins at Chepauk. In fact, when the two sides met earlier at the Wankhede, that's how the tables were turned in that game with the surface there assisting spin. On Saturday, though, it were CSK's quick men that did the job for them. Narbavi digs deep into how the game was won for the four-time champions.

DC add 'Salt' to RCB's wounds

A sensational Philip Salt assault led Delhi Capitals' rampaging six-wicket win over Royal Challengers Bangalore at the Kotla on Saturday (May 6). Much like Mumbai Indians earlier in the day, RCB also missed out on a chance to edge out their competitors in the playoffs race as they were put to the sword by a fearless DC attack. It did seem like the tourists had gotten a par score on the back of contrasting fifties from Virat Kohli and Mahipal Lomror but on a surface where batting got easier as the game went on, DC's power-packed top four came to the party. Skipper David Warner didn't get a lot but his start set the tone for Salt to do the heavy-lifting, with Mitchell Marsh and Riley Rossouw playing the perfect foil. Such was the carnage that the score was reached with 20 balls to spare. A deflating defeat indeed for RCB while DC continued their fine recent form with their fourth win in five games.

The Salt Assault

In his fledgling career so far, Philip Salt has shown how destructive he can be in the shortest format of the game. We've seen it in his England colours and in the other T20 leagues that he has been part of but the IPL hadn't quite experienced what it was to witness a Salt masterclass. Unfortunately for RCB, they were at the receiving end of it. Purnima decodes what exactly hit the Bangalore franchise at the Kotla.

Slippery Lucknow look to exploit Gujarat's vulnerable home record

Defending champions Gujarat Titans are sitting pretty at the top of the points table with a three-point lead over the others and Hardik Pandya's men will want to get a step closer to qualification as they take on Lucknow Super Giants on Sunday (May 7). The Titans, though, have a slight weakness. All three losses in the season have come at home and it's a record they'd want to improve, particularly with two playoffs contests including the final to be played in Ahmedabad. LSG, reeling with the exit of skipper KL Rahul to injury, will hope to exploit this chink in GT's armoury although it isn't going to be an easy task at all. Check out our match preview for a detailed peek into this contest.

Rajasthan hope for season resurrection against fidgety SRH

2022 was a fab year for the Rajasthan Royals, easily their best campaign since the title-winning season of 2008. Naturally, 2023 was expected to be another good season and while it began well, RR find themselves in a slump with just one win in their last five games. Given the kind of competition there is for a playoffs spot this year, Sanju Samson and co cannot afford such a big nosedive. They'll be keen to put their campaign on track against a struggling SRH outfit who are on the verge of elimination. A tricky contest ensues with both times desperate for different reasons. Our match preview will give you further insights on this encounter.

Quote of the day: MS Dhoni

""I would prefer him (Pathirana) not to play red-ball cricket and play all the ICC tournaments, he would be a great asset for Sri Lanka. He was slightly lean last season and has added muscle this season.""

Holders put one foot in the playoffs

Defending champions Gujarat Titans opened up breathing space at the top of a congested points table with a crucial, and dominating, win over fellow contenders Rajasthan Royals. The second clash between two of the form teams of IPL 2023 ended up in a mismatch after GT's Afghan spin twins, Rashid Khan and Noor Ahmad, sliced through the Royals line-up. A target of 119 was then chased down inside 14 overs thanks to a whirlwind 15-ball 39 from Hardik Pandya, an innings that arrived right amid mild concerns about his strike-rate from No.3 for his team. The win put the Titans at 14 points and took out significant NRR points from the Royals, who are now at the risk of being usurped from their top-four position over the weekend.

Report || Scorecard || Points Table

The making of Rashid Khan 2.0

A teenaged Noor Ahmad caught Aashish Kapoor's eye almost four years ago. The former India spinner then studied him extensively and even passed on his scouting reports to VVS Laxman (SRH) and Zaheer Khan (MI). But neither matched Kapoor's interest in the left-arm wristspinner. And so he went about convincing Ashish Nehra at the Gujarat Titans and had his way at the auction table. 2022 was spent in working on the youngster's action and it would seem 2023 and onwards will be all about reaping the dividends of those investments. Read how Kapoor unearthed the latest IPL gem in Prakash GV's piece.

Quote of the day: Aashish Kapoor

""I told [Ashish] Nehra you pick whoever you want, but let me pick one guy, that's Noor. For me he was a left-handed Rashid Khan. If you want Rashid Khan at whatever amount and you're getting another one who is a left-hander... both can be a deadly combination.""

On today's menu: Mumbai Indians descend at the Chepauk den

CSK and MI have nine IPL titles between them. Two measly points will be on offer at the Chepauk this afternoon but those two points could go a long way in either's quest to add to their trophy cabinet. This is the proverbial four-pointer in a very tight qualification race. Here two points earned is also two points denied. MI have rediscovered the zing to their batting, but last time around CSK strangled them with spin at the Wankhede. MS Dhoni's team are winless in three and were perhaps cost an extra point in that washout in Lucknow. They have a home run of three games from here and a win against MI will give them the bounce to make the Playoffs. Narbavie Rajendran brings it out in this preview. While you are in the mood to binge on MI-CSK content, why not relive some of the best contests between these two sides...

In the night game: RCB's chance to break into the top-four

Virat Kohli returns to his original hometown of Delhi where a win against the season's laggards will push RCB into the playoffs spots. RCB have had five days to cool off after the explosive win in Lucknow and will know they cannot be caught out cold against DC, who despite their standing, have won 3 of their last 4 - exactly the same as RCB. This contest though could come down to RCB's impressive PowerPlay bowling, now further bolstered by Hazlewood, against DC's batting struggles. Purnima Malhotra has more in this preview.

Karun in for KL

LSG confirmed the signing of Karun Nair as replacement for KL Rahul, who has been ruled out of the IPL (as well as the WTC Final) with a thigh injury. The 31-year-old Karun last turned out for KKR in the 2022 season, where he played only three games.

Stat of the day:

The David Warner-Phil Salt partnership has registered only a solitary run in three innings thus far!

***

Varun adds to his CV

The mystery spinner turned death-overs specialist and gave away just 12 runs from overs 16, 18 and 20 as KKR pipped SRH in Kolkata in a game they would have expected to drop at the half-way mark. KKR managed only 171. But then they reduced SRH to 54/4 and moved back on top before Heinrich Klaasen smashed 36 off 20 and in the company of captain Aiden Markram brought the chase down to a very gettable 48 off 36 when the former fell to the golden arm of Shardul Thakur in the 15th over. Markram fell to Vaibhav Arora for a 40-ball 41 and then Varun closed it out with impeccable spin bowling at the death, despite being given only 8 to defend in the final over.

'My heartbeat was touching 200'

""My heartbeat was touching 200 in the last over, but I wanted them to make hit to the longer part of the ground. The ball was slipping a lot and my best bet was longer side and that was my only hope. Last year I was bowling around 85kmph, I was trying out many things and I realized that I needed to work on my revolutions and I did work on it"" - Varun Chakravarthy

Any shake-ups in the standings?

Not particularly. SRH and KKR still occupy two of the bottom three spots. It would seem difficult for both these sides to make top four at this stage although KKR would say they are just one win away from the mid-table logjam. Either way both teams need a semblance of consistency in the home run. Here's how the table looks at the 2/3rd mark - almost.

KL Rahul out of IPL 2023, a doubt for WTC Final

The seemingly inevitable news has arrived. KL Rahul looked in a lot of pain when he injured himself in that game against RCB and Cricbuzz has learnt that he is now out of the remainder of IPL 2023. He came out to bat at the fag end of that game and did he worsen his injury with that act of bravery? For he's now a doubt for the WTC Final against Australia which is a little more than a month away. Here's Vijay Tagore with all the news from the LSG camp, including the injury concern for Jaydev Unadkat.

The underplayed and the overpaid

A dozen foreign players fetched from afar and paid a total of INR 205,500,000 (USD 2,574,563 at the time of writing) have yet to play a single match in this year's tournament. Chennai, Kolkata, Hyderabad and Punjab Kings would seem to have made better use of their resources: they have no foreign bench-sitters. Again, maybe not - Punjab, KKR and SRH are all in the bottom half of the standings. Telford Vice casts his unique perspective on player utilisation in this piece.

On today's menu: Last year's finalists meet in a tasty contest

We move from the bottom half to the top. In Jaipur, Rajasthan Royals host the holders in a crunch Friday night fixture. Should Gujarat Titans win this, they'll open up a three-point lead at the top, gold dust in a season of dog fights all around the standings. The SMS Stadium has thrown up two very different surfaces this season. Where could this game be won or lost? Prakash GV breaks it all down in this preview.

Rain has the last laugh as CSK, LSG share points

In what was the first no result game of the season, Lucknow Super Giants and Chennai Super Kings split points after rain intervened at the fag end of the hosts' innings to put an end to the game. The home side may have welcomed the eventual result, given that they had only gotten to a respectable total on yet another tricky Ekana surface in Lucknow. Despite being a red-soil deck as opposed to the black soil surfaces in recent games, the script was pretty much the same. CSK's spin troika exploited the slow gripping pitch to full effect and LSG were set for an embarrassing total before Ayush Badoni's stunning 33-ball 59 propped them up a fair bit as the youngster took on the bowling in the death overs. With four balls left for innings closure, showers arrived and had the final say.

Successive 200-plus chases? No problem!!

Mumbai Indians became the first side in IPL history to nail down back-to-back 200-plus run chases with a comfortable six-wicket win against Punjab Kings at the PCA Stadium in Mohali. Set a stiff target of 215 on a beautiful batting surface, blistering fifties from Ishan Kishan and Suryakumar Yadav made a mockery of the chase, setting it up for Tilak Varma and Tim David to finish things off with seven balls still to spare. Every Punjab bowler got pasted but the biggest punishment was reserved for Arshdeep Singh who recorded the most expensive figures by a bowler ever in the franchise. The left-arm seamer was the hero in the reverse fixture at the Wankhede and MI's batters avenged that loss in style. The Kishan-Surya stand overshadowed a fine PBKS batting performance earlier, headed by a Liam Livingstone powerhitting masterclass and his 119-run stand with Jitesh Sharma that came off just 52 balls.

Scorecard | Report

Jitesh the wily intent merchant

If his performances last season hadn't made people sit up and take notice, Jitesh Sharma's antics this year have certainly established him as a deadly T20 batter. High on intent and rich in powerhitting range, Jitesh was at it once again as he took apart MI's bowling attack with disdain. With a dearth of finishers in the country, notably wicket-keeper batters, Jitesh comes across as a whiff of fresh air.Purnima Malhotra dives deep into the history of the 29-year-old and tells us why the lad is so special.

Desperate times for SRH, KKR as they seek momentum shift

With six points apiece, Sunrisers Hyderabad and Kolkata Knight Riders face-off in Match 47 of the 2023 Indian Premier League at the Rajiv Gandhi Stadium on Thursday (May 5) knowing fully well that they are in a race against time. SRH do have a game in hand but that's little consolation at this stage, given how the other teams have stacked up above them. Relatively, it's more of a must-win game for Kolkata who can't afford another loss if they are to decide their own destiny. Check out our match preview to know the finer details about this fixture.

Kohli-Gambhir spat - who really pays the fines??

It's been two days after the most compelling off-field drama of the season and the euphoria is yet to die down. While speculations and conspiracy theories rule the roost regarding what happened between Virat Kohli and Gautam Gambhir on Monday (May 1) at the Ekana Stadium in Lucknow, the other matter of discussion has been about the fines. What are the figures and do the men involved have to pay them? Vijay Tagore brings us a detailed piece on the whole scenario.

***

From 23/5 to victory

It's the lowest score for the fall of the fifth wicket from where a team has gone on to win an IPL game. Bottom-placed Delhi Capitals stunned table-toppers and holders Gujarat Titans despite another forgettable top-order show. Last night, they had their bowlers and Aman Khan to thank. The latter for first propping them up to 130. Thereafter, the bowlers led by Ishant Sharma rocked the Titans' early in the chase. Hardik Pandya then scored a sedate half-century and when Rahul Tewatia hit Anrich Nortje for a hat-trick of sixes in the penultimate over of the match, the tide seemed to have turned the Titans' way. But Ishant dismissed Tewatia and defended 12 off the final over to give Capitals only their third win of the season.

Scorecard || Match Report

It's happened only twice!

This was only GT's second loss in 14 chases attempted in the IPL. The last and the only other time they've lost chasing was against Mumbai Indians last year, when they fell five short in a chase of 178.

Aman Khan steps up

While India's experienced duo of Mohamemd Shami (4 for 11) and Ishant Sharma (2 for 23) hogged most of the limelight, the defining batting performance of the night came from Aman Hakim Khan. The Mumbai batter wasn't even supposed to play the game before an illness to Mitchell Marsh gave him an opportunity. He had previously not been able to show his worth when DC were in a similarly dire situation at 58/4 against SRH. But today, he stitched two half-century stands with Patels, Axar and Ripal, and guided DC to what proved to be a winning score. Here's Vijay Tagore with more on him and his cricketing background.

The Kohli - Gambhir spat scoop

Trust Vijay Tagore to dig in and get more on the ugly Kohli-Gambhir-RCB-LSG confrontation at the Ekana Stadium. He spoke to those in the vicinity of that altercation in Lucknow and his piece is quite a lowdown on all that transpired. We'll leave you with a little teaser here...

""Those privy to the turn of events in the middle at the Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium confided to Cricbuzz that a high-spirited Kohli had started throwing verbal volleys at the opposition batsmen from the very beginning...""

On the menu today? A mid-week double header ft. CSK and MI...

... but they are not facing each other. That's a little later this week. After that explosive game against RCB, LSG will host Dhoni and Co. in the afternoon game at the Ekana, where they've lost each of their last three games. CSK love a nice slow, spinning track but they have their own wobbly boat to reallign. They've lost two on the bounce and would love to take two points and fortify their spot in the Top-4 before a run of three home games. These two sides produced an electric clash at Chepauk. There's unlikely to be as many runs in Lucknow but the contest should be spicy. Tactics and Matchups in our Preview.

For the evening fixture, we stay in the North of India, in Mohali, where PBKS welcome Mumbai Indians. Both sides come into the game having gunned down 200+ targets in their last games. So the batting units, it is expected, are in good shape. Both these sides are also in that tight mid-table logjam and in games like these, two points gained is a potential four-pointer for it is also two points denied to a fellow playoffs contender. Purnima Malhotra breaks down where this game could be won or lost.

What's the status on KL Rahul?

The LSG captain is still in pain and the hip-flexor injury picked up against RCB seems serious. He will definitely not play today and his participation in the remainder of the IPL will be decided by the BCCI, who have taken up his case with a WTC Final looming a little over a month away. More on this here.

Bowlers help RCB prevail at Lucknow in a low-scoring contest

After a Super Sunday that saw two 200-plus scores being chased down, the IPL swung the other way with a target of 127 being defended rather comfortably. In what was their joint-lowest total defended successfully, Royal Challengers Bangalore conjured up an 18-run win over Lucknow Super Giants at the Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow on Monday (May 1). On another typically slow and sticky surface at the venue, run-scoring was hard work, particularly against the older ball and only two batters got to 30 in the entire game - RCB skipper Faf du Plessis and his opening partner Virat Kohli. Their partnership ensured a steady start to the game but once the ball went soft, it was a downward spiral for RCB with Dinesh Karthik being the only other batter to get to double figures for the visitors. 127 was under-par, despite LSG missing skipper KL Rahul to an on-field injury, and although he did come to bat, that was only at no.11 with the game all but done. The hosts lost a plethora of wickets to their 'intent' and lost wickets from the get-go in pursuit of scoring briskly in the powerplay. Having lost four wickets in the first six overs, LSG could never really recover and succumbed to their third home defeat on the trot.

Scorecard | Report

Lucknow and the faltering home formula

Given the format of the IPL, having a decent home record becomes mandatory for a team that wishes to consistently make the playoffs. Even if not a fortress, the least a side needs is to be able to adapt to their home conditions. LSG have done anything but that and to be fair to them, their team composition, particularly the batting appears to be misfit for the super slow surfaces that have been dished out this season. For a side with free-stroking players, such decks actually backfire. This home vulnerability of LSG was exploited yet again as they fell to their third successive loss at home.

Kohli, Gambhir and Naveen-ul-Haq fined for code of conduct breach

Virat Kohli, Gautam Gambhir and Naveen-ul-Haq copped fines for breaching the Code of Conduct with their antics after the game ended. While Kohli and Gambhir were fined 100 percent of their match fees, the Afghanistan pacer was handed a fifty percent fine. The trio admitted to their offences and accepted the fines without any appeal.

Brittle Capitals face Titans juggernaut

On paper, Match 44 of the 2023 Indian Premier League looks like a mismatch. While one team is on a three-match winning streak, the other is yet to get to three wins for the season. That said, T20 is an unpredictable format, so you never know. The Titans look a well-rounded outfit with different people stepping up in different matches and that has been a hallmark of their wins right from their title-winning season last year. Capitals are at the other end of the spectrum and barring Axar Patel, no other player has really had a decent season so far. Time is running out for them as far as their playoff hopes are concerned and it is time for desperation. Check out our preview to find out match-ups, critical sub-plots and other info regarding this game.

Adventurous Punjab crack Chepauk code in thrilling finish

Chasing in a day game, particularly at the MA Chidambaram Stadium is no easy task. Particularly when the target is 201. But the Punjab Kings bucked the trend with a nail-biting last-over win against the Chennai Super Kings on Sunday (April 30). It seemed like another template Chepauk win for the hosts at one point as their spinners had worked the magic in the middle overs after a brisk powerplay to get the equation to steep levels but Liam Livingstone smashed Tushar Deshpande for a 24-run over to turn the tables. Runs started bleeding and despite a fine death over spell from Matheesha Pathirana, Punjab scrapped home with three needed off the final ball. It was a collective effort from the dynamic batting unit to give CSK their second home defeat of the season. Earlier on, Devon Conway's unbeaten 92 was the backbone of Chennai's total of 200 which included two successive sixes from MS Dhoni to finish the innings.

Scorecard | Report

Concerns for the Super Kings

That Chepauk is a fortress for CSK is an open secret and their overwhelming stats at home is testimony to that. However, the surfaces this season have been a stark contrast to the ones that we've been accustomed to. Is it a coincidence then, that Chennai have lost two home matches already out of four? There is also another dilemma - regarding skipper Dhoni's batting position. Is he batting too low? Particularly given how well he has struck the ball this season. Narbavi dives deep into a series of issues that need to be solved for the four-time champions.

History created at Wankhede in IPL's 1000th game

For all the mayhem that we associate with batters at the Wankhede, a 200-plus total had never been chased down in IPL history. Surprising?? Well, there is always a first, isn't there? Mumbai Indians ticked that box with a sporadic last-over win against Rajasthan Royals on Sunday (April 30). A vintage Suryakumar Yadav knock and a typical Tim David finish were the highlights of the run chase that was a roller-coaster ride for the hosts. With 17 needed off the final over, David nonchalantly smoked sixes off the first three deliveries to seal the game. Cameron Green and Tilak Varma also played their part in a collective effort from MI. It meant that Yashasvi Jaiswal's superlative ton, which was arguably the innings of the season, went in vain. In what was the 1000th match in IPL's fabled history, we couldn't have gotten a better contest and as far as MI are concerned, a perfect birthday gift for skipper Rohit Sharma.

Scorecard | Report

A hungry finisher

On a night when the Wankhede Stadium witnessed its first-ever successful chase of a 200-plus target, it was Tim David's final flurry that grabbed all the headlines. Mumbai Indians had several heroes in the run chase but David's blistering 14-ball 45 was easily one of the highlights. ""I've been really hungry to finish a game like that. It feels amazing,"" quipped David at the post-match press conference. ""The boys are excited. The other boys have been putting up big performances, so I was waiting for my turn. So, really pleased.""

RCB out for revenge against LSG in reverse fixture

The IPL caravan moves to Lucknow for Match 43 of the 2023 Indian Premier League season as Lucknow Super Giants get ready to host Royal Challengers Bangalore on Monday (May 1) at the Ekana Cricket Stadium. Who can forget the earlier fixture between the two sides in Bangalore, when a savage power-hitting display from Nicholas Pooran turned the game upside down in LSG's favour! It was a game that RCB had all but won, only to lose and they will be gunning to avenge the defeat. Conditions in Lucknow will be drastically different though from the earlier contest between the two sides and if the pitches till now are any indication, this could be a slow-burning thriller.

"Vipul Shah Reacts for 1st Time to The Kerala Story Row, Says 'If Anybody Has A Reason to Ban It...'

Vipul Shah exclusively spoke to News18 Showsha about the controversies surrounding his upcoming film The Kerala Story despite getting clearance from CBFC.

Reported By:  Titas Chowdhury

Edited By: Shrishti Negi

News18.com

Last Updated: May 01, 2023, 17:16 IST

Mumbai, India

The Kerala Story, starring Adah Sharma, will hit the theatres on May 5.

Filmmaker Vipul Amrutlal Shah’s upcoming film, The Kerala Story, has been creating headlines ever since its teaser was unveiled. It revolves around the stories of Hindu women of Kerala who were converted to Islam and trafficked to ISIS and other Islamic war zones in 2018-2019. It unearths the events behind approximately 32,000 women going missing in Kerala, who are said to have been radicalised and deployed in terror missions in India and the world. The trailer of the film triggered protests in Kerala and some parts of the country along with some political parties calling for a ban on the screening of the film.

In an exclusive chat with News18, Shah addresses the controversies surrounding the film, owing to its subject. Although he believes that they are simply portraying the “truth"" through the movie, he feels that political parties have the right to express their dissent as it’s “a sign of a healthy democracy."" Excerpts:

The Kerala Story is inspired from the life of a girl who was converted to Islam, sent to Syria and is in a jail in Afghanistan at present. Did you get the chance to speak to her?

My director (Sudipto Sen) spoke to her over a call while she was in jail. We also recorded a long interview with her mother. We collected all the information from both of them and that’s how we started [the process of making the film]. When we started working on it, we realised that there are many such cases that have happened and are happening in Kerala. And as a result of that, we came across the stories of three girls.

How much were you involved in the casting process?

I’ve co-written the film. I’m also the producer and creative director of the film. I get involved in every project that I do irrespective of what my role in it is. I believe that until and unless you put everything that you have into a project, you can’t get the best out of it.

Considering the film is based on a bold subject, was it tough getting actors on board? Were they apprehensive?

I don’t see it as a bold film but a story that was very important to be told. So, when we approached the actors, we felt no hesitation. They were all very happy to work on this film. Since this a story relating to girls, they all thought that it was important for the film to be made. So, everybody who has worked on this film, has worked with a lot of commitment and sincerity.

Some political groups have demanded a ban on the screening of The Kerala Story. Did that deter you?

I believe in the law. The censor board has cleared the film. They heavily scrutinised the film for almost one-and-a-half months before giving us the certificate. We’re glad that we went through this scrutiny. We know that every evidence and document we provided to the final authority of film certification have been approved. It shows that they have accepted our truth. After this, if some groups has complaints and want to create some kind of trouble, I think it is best left to the courts or any legal authority to decide. I don’t get bothered by these things. I believe we’ve done everything right according to the law. So, we’ve nothing to worry about.

You’ve said that The Kerala Story is a film about girls becoming victims and not Love Jihad. But don’t you think when you make films on a subjects like these, it inadvertently becomes political?

That tends to happen. Every political party has their own ideology. And when they find some issue which is either against or in sync with their ideology, they tend to connect with it. So, if any political party is opposing the film, then I’m sure the film is opposing the ideology of the party itself and that’s the reason why they feel this film shouldn’t be publicised or seen by people. That’s bound to happen in a country like India where politics is a very important part of our day-to-day lives. Everything tends to become political in our country. So, I can only expect things to get political when you’re making something which is an uncomfortable truth and people find it difficult to deal with. Hence, resistance is bound to happen. I don’t necessarily feel it’s a bad thing because people in a democracy have all the right to disagree with us and we’ve all the right to go and make a film that we believe in as long as we’re saying the truth. We’re open to any discussion and debate that anyone wants to have. I think that’s a sign of a healthy democracy.

But have you seen anybody not agreeing with what’s shown in The Kerala Story?

I read that a minister from Kerala has made a statement and given a call to ban the film. But again, if the film isn’t aligned with his or his party’s ideology, then he has all the right to speak against it. But whether a film should be banned or not should be decided by the courts and the censor board. In my understanding of law, once the censor board clears a film, it largely can’t be banned. But if anybody still has a reason to ban it, so be it. If a film talks about a murky trap laid for girls and that’s against a party’s ideology, then what can I say? It’s their choice and freedom to do whatever they feel is right. As far as I’m concerned, just because the film is called The Kerala Story, it doesn’t mean that the film is against Kerala.

Go on…

If a film is called Shootout at Lokhandwala and some criminals were shot in Lokhandwala in Mumbai, does that mean that the film is against Mumbai? There’s another film called Mumbai Saga which talks about the underworld of Mumbai. Does that mean it’s against Mumbai? If I was to show the story of Dawood Ibrahim? Where will I place it? I’ll have to place it in Mumbai because he operated here. Will that mean it’s against Mumbai? No. We call Kerala heaven on earth. It’s one of the most beautiful places in the world. But to say that there’s nobody in Kerala doing wrong things is like stretching it really too far. Making it about Kerala’s pride is also stretching it too far. I rather feel that the fantastic people of Kerala should come forward and catch these perpetrators and put them behind the bars. That would be doing service to their wonderful state rather than saying that we’re trying to defame their state by calling our film The Kerala Story and that they want to ban it. According to me, this just defies logic. If I love my city, I’ll do something for it rather than being an ostrich and putting my head into the sand, believing that nothing bad is happening. That’s not an approach I would take.

Have you screened the film for the families of the girls on whom the story is based?

They will see it soon. Some of them were suffering from Covid and so, we couldn’t show it to them earlier.

"War of words, ‘cash rewards’ over ‘The Kerala Story’ film. Top points | Latest News India - Hindustan Times

The Kerala Story, starring Adah Sharma, is set to be released in cinemas on May 5. | Latest News India

The content of the upcoming Hindi film ‘The Kerala Story’ has snowballed into a massive political backlash, with the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF), the Opposition United Democratic Front (UDF) and the Congress opposing the film.

The controversial film depicts how thousands of young women were brainwashed into joining the Islamic State (IS) and heading off to countries like Syria and Afghanistan.

1. Both the CPI(M) and the opposition Congress criticised the makers of the movie, saying they were taking up the Sangh Parivar propaganda of projecting the state as a centre of religious extremism by raising the bogey of 'love jihad' -- a concept rejected by the courts, probe agencies and the Union home ministry.

2. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has accused the Sangh Parivar of trying to destroy religious harmony in the state by “sowing the poisonous seeds of communalism”.

3. The Bharatiya Janata Party has termed as “double standards” the stand of the Kerala CM and ruling CPI(M) that freedom of speech and expression could not be a justification for using cinema to spread sectarianism in the state and create divisions.

4. As the BJP came out in support of the controversial film, Congress's Thiruvananthapuram MP Shashi Tharoor said Keralites had the right to say loud and clear that the movie was a ""misrepresentation of our reality"". ""Let me stress, I am not calling for a ban on the film. Freedom of expression does not cease to be valuable just because it can be misused. But Keralites have every right to say loud & clear that this is a misrepresentation of our reality,"" he tweeted.

5. According to reports, representatives of the Film Exhibitors United Organisation of Kerala (FEUOK) have stated that banning a film is futile since viewers can still watch it on OTT platforms. Suresh Shenoy, an office bearer of FEUOK and a theatre complex owner in Kochi, has been quoted by the media as saying that such a move sets a bad precedent and amounts to censorship.

6. The Kerala State Committee of Muslim Youth League has announced a reward of ₹1 crore for the individual who proves the “allegations” levelled in the movie.

7. In a strange twist, a right-wing activist and founder of the Hindu Seva Kendra Pratheesh Viswanath has also offered ₹10 crore. To prove the opposite: that no one from Kerala has gone to Syria to join IS.

The Kerala Story, starring Adah Sharma, is set to be released in cinemas on May 5. It is backed by Sunshine Pictures Private Limited, founded by Vipul Amrutlal Shah, who serves as the producer, creative director and co-writer of the film.

The film's writer-director Sudipto Sen's earlier movies are 'Aasma', 'Lucknow Times' and 'The Last Monk.'

"Kerala government calls for ban on controversial film, The Kerala Story. Exhibitors say 'not a good precedent' - India Today

Politicians in Kerala don't want the film to be released there but theatre exhibitors state people will watch The Kerala Story on OTT anyway.

By Latha Srinivasan: The Kerala Story has created a buzz since it reportedly tells the story of how thousands of young women were brainwashed into joining the Islamic State (IS) and heading off to countries like Syria and Afghanistan. It focuses on the unverified claim that 32000 women from Kerala joined IS but official records reportedly show no such data.

Political parties in Kerala, like the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF), the Opposition United Democratic Front (UDF) and their youth organisations have opposed the release of this film in the state. Congress in Kerala has also opposed the film. advertisementEXHIBITORS SAY NO CENSORSHIP?Now members of the Film Exhibitors United Organisation of Kerala (FEUOK) have stated that banning The Kerala Story was not of any use since the audience would watch the film when it releases on OTT anyway. FEUOK office bearer Suresh Shenoy, who owns a theater complex in Kochi, reportedly told the media that banning a film was not a good precedent. He added that this was akin to censorship.

Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said in a Facebook post on April 30 that this movie was made by the Sangh Parivar to spread lies. The CM added, ""A glance at the trailer gives the impression that the movie was deliberately produced with the aim of communal polarisation and spreading hate propaganda against Kerala. By placing Kerala, the land of secularism, as the centre of religious extremism, it is repeating the Sangh Parivar’s propaganda. Propaganda films and the othering of Muslims should be viewed in the context of various efforts made by the Sangh Parivar to gain an advantage in electoral politics in Kerala.""

"Uttarakhand, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh and now Karnataka: How BJP is advancing its UCC agenda | Political Pulse News,The Indian Express

After the party promised a panel on UCC in Uttarakhand and won the 2021 Assembly elections in the hill State, the playbook was replicated in Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh.

The BJP on Monday promised to implement the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) in Karnataka if it returns to power, mentioning it in its election manifesto. The party had mentioned the UCC promise in its manifestos for the Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh elections last year. In the Karnataka manifesto, the party said it would introduce UCC “based on the recommendations of a high-level committee to be constituted for the purpose”.

The Uniform Civil Code aims to provide one law for the entire country, applicable to all religious communities in their personal matters such as marriage, divorce, inheritance, and adoption. The Constitution lists UCC among the Directive Principles of State Policy, which makes it a desirable objective but it is not justiciable.

Over the decades, the BJP in particular has pushed for UCC and it was part of the party’s manifestos for the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Both times, the party framed it as an issue related to gender justice. “Article 44 of the Constitution of India lists Uniform Civil Code as one of the Directive Principles of State Policy. BJP believes that there cannot be gender equality till such time India adopts a Uniform Civil Code, which protects the rights of all women, and the BJP reiterates its stand to draft a Uniform Civil Code, drawing upon the best traditions and harmonizing them with modern times,” the party said both times.

The BJP has stepped up its efforts for UCC since last year. In May 2022, the Uttarakhand government of Pushkar Singh Dhami fast-tracked the process to set up a committee on the implementation of UCC, months after returning to power.

Though the UCC promise did not find a place in the “vision document” released on February 9, the BJP brought it up on the last day of campaigning. On February 12, just two days before the state was set to go to polls, Dhami announced that his government would form a committee of experts for a draft UCC.

“The security of the cultural and religious heritage of Uttarakhand, security of its environment and security of its borders is important not just for the state but the entire country. Soon after the oath-taking ceremony, the BJP government will form a committee of those with knowledge of the legal system, retired employees, prominent people from society, and other stakeholders to prepare a draft of the UCC,” Dhami said.

After the first Cabinet meeting of the newly formed government in March, Dhami announced his plans to set up the committee. In May, the state home department issued an order that read, “The Governor has given his permission to establish an expert committee to check all the relevant laws which control personal matters for people living in Uttarakhand, and to prepare a report on amendments in the present laws.”

The party adopted a similar approach before the Gujarat and Himachal elections last December. In October, ahead of the release of the poll schedule, Gujarat Home Minister Harsh Sanghavi announced that the Cabinet had decided to form a committee for the implementation of UCC. This was reaffirmed in the manifesto that was released on November 27. The manifesto promised to “ensure complete implementation of the Gujarat Uniform Civil Code committee’s recommendations”, among others. The BJP returned to power in the state, winning 156 of the 182 seats. Similarly, the BJP sankalp patra in Himachal Pradesh, released on November 6, promised to implement UCC.

On January 10 this year, the Supreme Court junked a public interest litigation (PIL) plea challenging the decision of the Gujarat and Uttarakhand governments to set up the expert committees. A Bench of Chief Justice of India D Y Chandrachud and P S Narasimha said the government’s decisions cannot be challenged as ultra vires the Constitution as they were within the powers of the state under Article 162, dealing with the extent of executive power of a state. “What is wrong with it? They have constituted a committee under their executive powers under Article 162…,” said Chandrachud.

Other states have also pitched for the UCC.

On May 1 last year, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma spoke in its favour, asserting that it is an issue for all Muslim women. Sarma told reporters, “Everybody supports UCC. No Muslim woman wants that her husband brings home three other wives… do three marriages. Who would want that? This isn’t my issue, this is an issue for Muslim mothers and women.”

Months later, on December 1 last year, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan also spoke of the issue.

Asserting that “some fraud elements” are marrying women from tribal communities and taking over land in their names, he said everyone “should marry only once” and announced the decision to form a committee to look into implementation of Uniform Civil Code (UCC) in the state.

On April 23 this year, Uttar Pradesh deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya said the Uttar Pradesh government was thinking seriously in the direction of the implementation of the Uniform Civil Code in the state, Deputy Chief Minister

BJP leaders have also been pushing for it on the national stage.

On November 25, 2022, Union Home Minister Amit Shah, speaking at the Times Now Summit on “India: A vibrant democracy, global bright spot”, said UCC had been a promise of the BJP since its Jana Sangh days. “Not only the BJP, the Constituent Assembly also advised Parliament and states that UCC should come at an opportune time. For any secular country, laws should not be on the basis of religion. If a nation and states are secular, how can laws be based on religion? For every believer, there should be one law passed by Parliament or the state Assemblies,” he said.

The following month, BJP Rajya Sabha MP Kirodi Lal Meena triggered an Opposition uproar by introducing a Private Member’s Bill on the civil code.

In its monthly editorial this February, the RSS-linked magazine Indraprastha Samwad made a case for UCC saying: “Why should mosques, churches, and gurdwaras be allowed to manage their affairs and finances, while the government exercises control over affairs of temples, and why should Muslim women be deprived of alimony after divorce, when Hindu women are entitled to it?”"
"Karnataka Assembly Election 2023, Congress Manifesto: Congress Cites Bajrang Dal, PFI In Karnataka Promise To Act Against Hatred

Karnataka Assembly Election 2023: Congress promises action, including ban, on organisations spreading hatred in manifesto, cites Bajrang Dal, PFI.

Karnataka Assembly Election 2023: Congress promises action on organisations spreading hatred.

In its manifesto for the May 10 assembly elections in Karnataka, the Congress equated banned Islamic outfit Popular Front of India (PFI) with Bajrang Dal, the youth wing of the Sangh-affiliated Vishwa Hindu Parishad, saying it will ban such organisations that promote ""enmity or hatred, whether among majority or minority communities"".

""The Congress Party is committed to take firm and decisive action against individuals and organisations spreading hatred amongst communities on grounds of caste or religion. We believe that law and Constitution is sacrosanct and can not be violated by individuals and Organisations like Bajrang Dal, PFI or others promoting enmity or hatred, whether among majority or minority communities,"" the manifesto, called 'Sarva Janangada Shanthiya Thota' (peaceful garden of all communities), read, adding that the party, if voted to power in the state, will take 'decisive action' as per law, including imposing a ban on them.

It also promised to repeal, within a year of coming to power, ""all unjust laws and other anti-people laws"" passed by the BJP government in the state.

The grand old party reiterated its five guarantees -- Gruha Jyothi (which promises 200 units of free electricity to all), Gruha Lakshmi (Rs 2,000 monthly to every woman head of the family), Anna Bhagya (10 kg of food grains of their choice -- among rice, ragi, jowar, millet -- to every person in a BPL family), Yuva Nidhi (Rs 3,000 every month for two years to unemployed graduates, and Rs 1,500 every month as an allowance for unemployed diploma holders), and Shakti (free travel to all women throughout the state in regular KSRTC/BMTC buses).

As a ""sixth guarantee"", Congress national president Mallikarjun Kharge, who has won assembly polls a record nine consecutive times in the state, said the promises will be implemented in the first cabinet meeting on the first day of government formation.

The manifesto was released in the presence of former Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah, the KPCC President DK Shivakumar and Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera.

Earlier, in April, Union Home Minister Amit Shah said each vote to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will protect the state from PFI.

The centre had, in September last year, banned the PFI under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. The Home Ministry said PFI and its affiliates have been indulging in unlawful activities ""prejudicial to the integrity, sovereignty and security of the country"", and that they have the potential to disturb public peace and communal harmony.

""Several criminal activities and brutal murders have been committed by PFI members over the past to create a reign of terror in the public mind,"" it said.

Karnataka will go to Assembly polls on May 10 and the counting of votes will take place on May 13.

"Express View on BJP’s Karnataka manifesto: High on Hindutva | The Indian Express

Manifestos are usually academic exercises and with just nine days left for polling, this one is hardly the document that can fire the imagination of Karnataka that, by most accounts, is looking for change.

The BJP manifesto for Karnataka polls released Monday is a mixture of Hindutva demands and welfare promises. However, it hardly echoes the aspirational pitch Prime Minister Narendra Modi makes at his election rallies in the state though he has described the manifesto as “development-centric”. Nor does it meet the demands of a state that has been falling behind even among its southern neighbours in human development indices, including for health, education, nutrition etc. Releasing the manifesto, party president J P Nadda said: “Our manifesto is a vision document for a developed Karnataka. It encompasses a forward looking approach and promises to fulfil the aspirations of everyone in Karnataka.” It’s hard to see how. There are the stock promises straight from the polarisation playbook, coming in the wake of the debates on hijab, Muslim reservation etc. As for welfare and development initiatives, they seem more like a response to the criticism that the Basavaraj Bommai government achieved little in office.

On top of the list of promises is a Uniform Civil Code and a National Register of Citizens (NRC). Why would Karnataka, a southern state with no international border, be keen on an NRC considering that the exercise is meant to identify illegal migrants? The party has also promised to set up a panel “to grant complete autonomy of temple administration to devotees”, and regulate “local businesses around temples to create a sustainable temple economy”. The temple economy reference comes in the backdrop of Hindutva groups demanding that the government must “ban” Muslims from running shops on temple premises, or setting up shops during temple fairs. These promises, like the campaign pitch around laws concerning cattle slaughter ban and conversion and Muslim quotas, may resonate among the BJP’s core base. However, these are unlikely to stave off anti-incumbency in the more middle-of-the-road voter struggling with a sluggish economy, lack of decent jobs, and crumbling public infrastructure. The welfare assurances like free LPG cylinders and milk are more of an attempt to account for previous postures. Take the promise of half litre of Nandini milk daily to BPL families under Poshan Yojana. This has the trappings of a defensive gesture since the Opposition had charged — with more rhetoric than fact — that the BJP government planned to merge the state-run Karnataka Milk Federation’s Nandini dairy brand with Gujarat’s Amul. Similarly, the promise of Atal Aahara Kendras to provide “affordable, quality and hygienic food” in every municipal ward is just reiteration of a 2018 item — Annapoorna canteen — that did not take off. The Indira Canteens, set up in 2017 across Bengaluru when Siddaramaiah was the chief minister, are in a poor shape.

Manifestos are usually academic exercises and with just nine days left for polling, this one is hardly the document that can fire the imagination of a state that, by most accounts, is looking for change. That said, the BJP is likely to bank on its formidable organisational clout and resources and, of course, its central leadership’s energy and the PM’s personal push to stave off anti-incumbency. A report card of its five years in office will be what matters — this manifesto is postscript, at best."
"Arun started defaming Athira online as wedding was called off, says brother-in-law

Athira ended her life because she was defamed on the social media, said her brother-in-law and IAS officer Ashish Das..Athira suicide. cyberbully. Brother in law. IAS.Ashish Das. Facebook posts

Hello

Kottayam: More details on the cyberbullying that forced a young woman to take her own life at her house at Kaduthuruthy in Kottayam district has emerged even as the accused with whom she had an affair is still at large.

Problems arose between the two after this. When it was realised that the two could not reconcile with each other, they ended their friendship. But he began creating trouble when marriage proposals started coming in for Athira. The two had spoken to each other on the fateful night,"" claimed Das.

"Cyberbullying: Kerala woman ends life, male ‘friend’ booked | India News,The Indian Express

Athira’s brother-in-law Ashish Das, a Manipur cadre IAS officer, in his Facebook post said that his sister’s suicide can no better be termed murder by a cyberbully.

A 26-year-old woman has ended her life in Kerala’s Kottayam district following alleged cyber bullying of her former friend, the police said.

The police said that V M Athira, a native of Manjoor in the district, was found dead at her home on Monday, a day after she lodged a complaint against her male friend named Arun Vidyadharan who lives barely a kilometre away.

Following the suicide of Athira, Arun has been booked on charges of abetting suicide, officials said. The youth has gone into hiding.

According to the police, despite Athira snapping her friendship with Arun, he continued to trouble her by sharing their past chat history and her photos on social media, especially after Athira’s family was getting marriage proposals for her.

Athira’s brother-in-law Ashish Das, a Manipur cadre IAS officer, in his Facebook post said that his sister’s suicide can no better be termed murder by a cyberbully. “I promise you my dear, your killer will be brought to justice and ensure maximum punishment. Will make sure this fate will not happen to any other girl,” Das stated.

Athira had complained to the local police against Arun alleging that he was insulting her on social media.

Ashish Das told reporters on Tuesday that Athira resorted to the extreme step following cyberbullying. “After Athira complained to the police, Arun stepped up the attack and threatened her. We, the family members, comforted her and stood with her. She was very upset that Arun had dragged my name also into the issue,” he said.

Kaduthuruthy police station house officer Sajeev Cheriyan said that the police got the complaint on Sunday night. “Immediately, we called Arun and asked him to report at the station the next day. We have traced him and he will be arrested soon,” said the inspector.

Athira had reportedly got estranged from him due to his shady dealings with drug peddlers."

"“No championship 99% but you scored” – Robert Lewandowski’s ex-teammate brutally mocks Cristiano Ronaldo after Al-Nassr win over Al-Raed

Adrian Mierzejewski, who played for Poland alongside Barcelona ace Robert Lewandowski, has criticized Al-Nassr superstar Cristiano Ronaldo for his celebrations during the routing of Al-Raed.

Adrian Mierzejewski, who played for Poland alongside Barcelona ace Robert Lewandowski, has criticized Al-Nassr superstar Cristiano Ronaldo for his celebrations during the routing of Al-Raed.

Al-Nassr skipper Cristiano Ronaldo opened the scoring in his side’s 4-0 win over Saudi Pro League strugglers, 11th-placed Al-Raed on Friday night (April 28). After heading the ball in from close range in the fourth minute, the 38-year-old wheeled away in celebration and pulled out his signature “Siuu” celebration. While fans at Al Awal Park enjoyed Ronaldo’s trademark roar, former Al-Nassr attacking midfielder Mierzejewski was less than impressed.

Mierzejewski has claimed that the goal was not worth such a grand celebration, as he was unable to inspire his team in the big games.

Retweeting a video of the Real Madrid legend’s celebration, Mierzejewski mockingly stated:

On April 23, the Riyadh-based club were eliminated from the King’s Cup semi-finals after suffering a 1-0 defeat to Al-Wehda. Four days prior, on April 19, Al-Nassr lost 2-0 to Al-Hilal in the Riyadh derby, which landed a hammer blow on their title aspirations.

Having played 25 matches, Cristiano Ronaldo’s Al-Nassr find themselves three points behind league leaders Al-Ittihad in the Saudi Pro League standings. Al-Ittihad have a game in hand.

After going three games without scoring a goal, Al-Nassr ace Cristiano Ronaldo was back to his best in the 4-0 win over Al-Raed on Friday.

It took only four minutes for the former Manchester United star to find the back of the net. He timed his run perfectly to get to the end of Sultan Al Ghannam’s delivery into the area. From point-blank range, he comfortably found the bottom-right corner of Al-Raed’s goal. It marked his 12th Saudi Pro League goal in as many matches.

A well-taken goal aside, Ronaldo created a game-high two chances. He also pulled off two of three dribbles, played six passes into the final third, and won four of six aerial duels.

Five-time Ballon d’Or winner Ronaldo went through his iconic goal routine after hitting the back of the net, but ex-Poland international Adrian Mierzejewski – who spent two years in Riyadh between 2014 and 2016 – has questioned why the 38-year-old was so ecstatic after seeing any hope of landing a major trophy with Al-Nassr disappear following his high-profile arrival.

THE BIGGER PICTURE: Mierzejewski posted on social media, alongside a video of Ronaldo celebrating his 12th goal through 15 appearances for Al-Nassr: “That moment when you lost the Supercup, you were eliminated in the semi-final of the Copa, you lost the derby to Hilal, which means no championship 99%, but you scored against Al Raed and your team won 4-0.”

WHAT NEXT? Ronaldo has previously collected major honours aplenty with Manchester United, Real Madrid and Juventus, but he appears set to end his first season in the Middle East empty-handed – although the most lucrative contract in world football should help to soften that blow."

Al Nassr’s star footballer Cristiano Ronaldo was brutally trolled by former Poland International Adrian Mierzejewski in his recent tweet.

Mierzejewski, who spent two years in Riyadh between 2014 to 2016, has questioned why the 38-year-old was so ecstatic after seeing any hope of landing a major trophy with Al- Nassr disappear following his high-profile-arrival.

“That moment when you lost the Super Cup, were eliminated in the semi-finals of the King’s Cup, you lost the derby to Hilal which means no championship for 99%, but you scored against Al Raed and your team won 4-0,” Mierzejewski tweeted.

The former player also posted a video of Ronaldo celebrating his 12th goal in 15 matches for Al-Nassar.

In the match, Ronaldo made a direct run into the penalty area from the left before attempting to shoot. But before he could hit the ball, Al-Raed defender Mubarak Abdulrahman Al Rajeh tackled him, and Ronaldo tumbled to the ground. He immediately appealed for a penalty, but he was left furious when the referee denied his claims.

Ronaldo, who joined on a contract estimated to be worth more than $220 million, had looked disgruntled in recent weeks as Al Nassr failed to score in three straight games.

Ronaldo’s smile was back on Friday, however, as he celebrated a fourth-minute headed goal in trademark fashion.

The 38-year-old Portuguese forward also contributed to Abdul Rahman Gharib’s second goal with another header."

Former Poland international teammate, Adrian Mierzejewski, has mocked Al-Nassr captain Cristiano Ronaldo for his celebrations during his team’s 4-0 win over Al-Raed last Friday.

Ronaldo opened the scoring in his side’s win over Al-Raed.

After heading the ball in from close range, Ronaldo wheeled away in celebration and pulled out his signature “Siuu” celebration.

While fans enjoyed Ronaldo’s trademark roar at Al Awal Park, Mierzejewski, a former Al-Nassr midfielder, was less than impressed.

Retweeting a video of Ronaldo’s celebration, Mierzejewski mockingly stated on Twitter over the weekend:

“That moment when you lost the Supercup, you were eliminated in the semi-final of the Copa del Rey, you lost the derby to Hilal which means no championship 99% but you scored against Al Raed and your team won 4-0.”

"Karnataka Elections: Congress Is Ahead, But Is it in a Safe Zone?

Even if the Congress is ahead of the BJP in most pre-poll surveys, it faces one disadvantage. Its votes are spread more thinly across the state than that of BJP's.

Even if the Congress is ahead of the BJP in most pre-poll surveys, it faces one disadvantage. Its votes are spread more thinly across the state than that of BJP's.

As Karnataka enters the last phase of electioneering, the popular narrative is that the Congress is likely to trump the Bharatiya Janata Party in the assembly polls. Most pre-poll surveys indicate a clear lead for the Congress over the BJP, even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi unleashes his personal firepower in the final week of campaigning.

The BJP candidates have been waiting for Modi’s appearance like farmers look to the sky for rains in a drought year. C.T. Ravi, a former minister in the Karnataka cabinet and the BJP candidate from Chikmagalur assembly seat, candidly says Modi will bring an extra 1-2% vote swing in the BJP’s favour over the next seven days. “Modi’s presence will absorb some of the anger that may exist against our us,” says Ravi.

The BJP’s self goals in terms of its inability to stem the exodus of senior party leaders must surely work in the Congress’s favour.

There is little doubt that the momentum is with the Congress, which can often be seen in the somewhat weak body language of BJP leaders and workers who are just hoping that Modi will somehow work a miracle before campaigning ends on May 8. A senior BJP minister and a candidate in Bengaluru did not even disguise this sentiment when he said, “Modiji will come and turn voters in our favour in the coming week.” He clearly seemed to imply that without Modi’s intervention, things were not going all that well for the BJP.

This underlying theme played out consistently as one travelled from Bangalore to Hubbali via Mysore, Hasan, Chikmagalur and Shimoga.

Deepak Doddaiah, the BJP candidate from Mudigere constituency in Chikmagalur, said in no uncertain terms that Modi’s public meetings in the last leg of campaigning will make a difference. Even ordinary BJP workers seemed to echo this sentiment. It is almost as if they have all been reflexively programmed to say that Modi will come and rescue them. Most BJP leaders seemed acutely aware that the party is facing severe anti-incumbency, made worse by the perception of this being the most corrupt government in a long time. The term “40% sarkara” has caught on like a wild fire. The BJP cannot brush this under the carpet.

The question now, is how much difference will Modi make? Most pre-poll surveys show the Congress crossing 40% vote share (it had 38% in 2018) and touching the majority mark of 113 seats out of a total of 224 seats in the assembly.

However, the Congress may face some unexpected headwinds. The grand old party’s most popular leader. Siddaramaiah, told a group of visiting journalists that the party must get more than 120 seats to be safe. He admitted that anything less than 120 seats for the Congress could attract horse trading by the BJP and JD(S) combine. This fear is quite palpable among the Congress leaders, who admit they can’t match BJP’s money power in the event the Congress lead is somewhat slender.

Senior Congress leader D.K. Shivakumar said he was also worried about the voters’ list having undergone a change in many areas where an unusually large number of voters are missing. “We are keeping a close watch on this,” he said.

Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai put up a brave face and asserted that the BJP will get a majority and the pre-poll surveys would be proved wrong. Bommai admitted to us that the “Congress had succeeded in spreading the impression of corruption and misgovernance against us but our work in the rural areas will speak for itself.” Bommai specially talked of his government’s sustained programme to build roads and other village infrastructure in Scheduled Caste-dominated areas. “This will definitely bring us dividends,” Bommai said.

Asked about the likely damage caused by senior leader Jagadish Shettar’s exit from the BJP, Bommai brushed it aside, saying Shettar may not save his own seat in Hubli.

At Shettar’s home, there is still a Modi picture hanging. When asked why it was still there, he said he was not so small-minded as to remove it immediately. Photo: Special arrangement

However, when we met Shettar at his home in Hubli, he seemed confident that he would not only win his own seat comfortably but also bring up to 5,000 votes away from BJP in over two dozen other constituencies dominated by the Lingayat community which has strong presence in many parts of Karnataka. Traditionally, 60% to 70% of the Lingayats voted for the BJP in Karnataka. But Shettar asserts this time a good chunk of Lingayats will move away from the BJP.

This claim is predictably pooh-poohed by Bommai, a Lingayat leader himself. The BJP is depending on its tallest Lingayat leader B.S. Yediurappa and Bommai to hold on to its traditional Lingayat vote base. However, Shettar’s humiliation by the BJP central leadership and his much publicised exit from the party will certainly do some damage, say most observers. How much of the BJP’s traditional Lingayat vote base splinters is a very critical factor in this election. It would decide whether the Congress is able to hit a comfortable majority of 120 seats plus.

The other important factor for the Congress will be whether the JD(S), which is controlled by former Prime Minister Deve Gowda’s family, will end up helping the BJP. “In many constituencies the JD(S) has fielded weak candidates against the BJP to hurt the Congress,” says Yathindra, the sitting MLA of Varuna constituency in old Mysore. This time Yathindra has vacated his seat for his father, Siddaramaiah. Varuna is a prestigious battle where the BJP and JD(S) will both try to defeat the Congress stalwart.

Senior Congress leader D.K. Shivakumar is also convinced that there is a hidden deal between the BJP and JD(S). He cites as evidence the fact that Modi generally refrains from criticising the JD(S), which is contesting in 200 seats.

If the JD(S) hurts the Congress more than it does the BJP, then the Congress tally even after an improved performance may fall short of a safe majority which is 120 seats out of 224. A three-way fight with hidden deals can result in complex outcomes, depending on which of the two dominant parties get hurt more by the less significant third player. In this sense, JD(S) remains the joker in the pack. Even recent electoral history shows JD(S) has just enough vote base to cause a hung assembly. Surveys suggest the voter this time might give a decisive mandate.

Also read: Why the Karnataka Assembly Elections Are a Do-or-Die Battle for the Congress

Even if the Congress is ahead of the BJP in most pre-poll surveys, it faces one disadvantage. Its votes are spread more thinly across the state than that of BJP’s. Congress got merely 80 seats in 2018, though its vote share at 38% was more than that of BJP’s 36%. With two percentage points less votes, the BJP emerged as a single largest party with 104 seats because its votes were more concentrated in certain regions. So even if the Congress vote percentage this time crosses 40% and is ahead of BJP by four to five percentage points, one is not sure whether it would convert to a safe majority of 120 to 130 seats so that chances of horse trading become remote. These are some of the imponderables the Congress must face in the Karnataka polls.

Overall, a simple majority of 120 plus will help the Congress and the opposition at large create a broader sentiment that the BJP under Modi can be challenged politically and electorally. So the long-term implications of the Karnataka elections go well beyond the state itself."

The campaigning for the State Assembly elections is entering a critical phase and the agenda being pitched is increasingly turning out to be BJP’s national vs Congress’ local in the rural hinterland.

From depending on Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Home Minister Amit Shah and U.P. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for serial campaigns and road shows to woo the voters, the BJP is projecting its national leaders as the face of a strong and stable governance.

In contrast, the Congress on its part is more vocal about the local and is harnessing the appeal and draw of their ‘’home-grown’’ leaders ranging from Siddaramaiah and M. Mallikarjun Kharge to D.K. Shivakumar.

Though the Congress national leaders, including Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi, have made frequent appearances, they appear to be ‘’token’’ in nature when compared to the publicity blitzkrieg being launched by the BJP leaders crisscrossing the State.

The BJP’s fixation on national issues is seen as a diversion by the Congress to evade scrutiny of their local performances. In the interiors of Varuna, for instance, the BJP candidate V. Somanna - who is billed as an ‘’outsider’’ and pitted against Siddaramaiah - has little to show to the voters of his development works to which the local populace could relate. For, Mr. Somanna’s political roots are in Bengaluru.

His campaign speeches hence refer to highways, airports, rail infrastructure, Vande Bharat trains etc all of which are Centre’s projects. They do have deep implications in an urban milieu but has little resonance with the rural populace especially in the interior regions where livelihood and farming issues matter.

Here, the Congress has an upper hand and though out of power for five years, the Siddaramaiah government’s scheme of ₹1 per kg of rice has a better recall value among the voters. The Congress is building on this and has now promised 10 kg of free rice besides free power up to 200 units, unemployment doles, increase in wages to the ASHA workers to which the rural voters can easily relate to.

The BJP campaign makes no mention of local schemes of the Basavaraj Bommai government announced in the State Budget, including those where the implementation has been effective as claimed by its spokespersons.

A case in point being PM Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana where the penetration is 94% in the State. But it also has a central government’s appendage to it and is not entirely a State project. The piped drinking water project has impressive coverage but again is part of Jal Jeevan Mission and is Prime Minister’s pet project.

Though Mr. Bommai announced free education for girls in government colleges, free rides for working women, scholarship for farmers children there is little reference to these and the focus drifts to national issues in the BJP camp.

One subject which has resonance across the country and is raised by the Congress is the imputation that the BJP – if elected – would tinker with the Constitution, an insinuation that forces the BJP on the backfoot to counter the narrative. The other is the reservation issue.

More than emphasising on what the BJP has failed to deliver - on employment generation, curbing price rise etc - the Congress is off late focusing on its ‘’guaranteed’’ promises that have local and immediate relevance and implications for the voters. To counter it, the BJP manifesto offering freebies was released on Monday but is perceived to have come too late to gain traction and tickle down to the rural areas as there are just nine days to go for the polls.

"In Karnataka, it’s a battle of Congress’s perception management versus BJP’s micro-management

Congress’s strategy is to expose alleged shortcomings in governance. BJP, meanwhile, is doing what it does best — seat-by-seat micro-management while focussing on the PM’s appeal.

Bengaluru/Mandya/Mysuru:  In the 1975 film Sholay, dacoit Gabbar had killed Rahim chacha’s son while he was going from his village, Ramgarh, into town to look for a job. Forty-seven years since this movie, the real-life village in Ramanagara where it was shot comes as a reminder of reel-life Ramgarh when it comes to poverty. Go near the rocks of the Ramagiri hills and one can almost hear Hema Malini’s character Basanti singing ‘Jab tak hai jaan…main nachungi’.

Most of the villagers here belong to the Scheduled Tribes (ST). Anil Kumar, a young man, says that all that they get in terms of welfare schemes is 4 kg foodgrains as monthly ration.

There are two Lingayat families in the village. Shakuntala and Shivaswamy have no complaints against the government, even though they have to depend on water tankers. The big water tank from the top of which Veeru (Dharmendra) threatened “suicide” is nowhere to be seen.

They are happy to inform us that they vote for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). It doesn’t matter to them why B.S. Yediyurappa was replaced by Basavaraj Bommai as the chief minister. Bommai is a Lingayat too, Shakuntala tells ThePrint smilingly.

The couple have a reason to thank the government — a small road connecting their house with the main road and a wall shielding the house from overhanging rocks.

Pointing to ST households, she says they vote for the Congress “for reasons only they know”.

About 100 km west of Bengaluru, sitting near the entrance of Adichunchanagiri Math, four men in panches and shirts get agitated when asked about Sumalatha Ambareesh, an actress and the sitting Member of Parliament from Mandya, where the math is located.

“It was a mistake,” says one of them about having elected the independent MP, who had, in the 2019 General Election, defeated Nikhil Kumaraswamy, the grandson of former prime minister H.D. Deve Gowda and son of former chief minister H.D Kumaraswamy. While the BJP had extended support to her, many Congress leaders had also indirectly helped her.

In March, Sumalatha vowed support to the BJP. But these four men from the Vokkaliga community predict Kumaraswamy’s return as the CM.

They wouldn’t admit that they vote for the Gowdas because they are Vokkaliga. “They are pro-farmer, that’s why,” quipped one, when asked why they voted for them.

Travel around Karnataka — in southern parts, at least, where ThePrint visited three districts — and election discourse seems to be centred around castes, with other issues virtually remaining dormant, if at all. There’s no talk of Hindutva, governance or the lack of it, or corruption.

The last four elections show the three major players — the BJP, the Congress and the JD(S) — have more or less retained their support base. The vote shares of the Congress in the last four elections were: 38 per cent (2018), 36 per cent (2013), 35 per cent (2008) and 35 per cent (2004).

The BJP’s vote shares in these elections were: 36 per cent (2018), 20 per cent (2013, when BS Yediyurappa quit the BJP and his party took away 10 per cent of the vote), 34 per cent (2008) and 28 per cent (2004). For the JD(S), the figures stood at 18 per cent, 20 per cent, 19 per cent and 21 per cent.

In the absence of any major emotive issues and unless there is a major chink in the BJP’s Lingayat votebank, indications from the Gowda land are likely to keep all parties on tenterhooks. Predictions of independent surveys aside, internal surveys of both the BJP and the Congress are keeping both of them optimistic. According to BJP insiders, the party’s internal survey predicts 100 seats in the 224-member assembly. The Congress’s survey predicts 110 seats for it.

In this scenario, the two major parties have adopted different strategies. The opposition is focusing on building public perceptions about the BJP being a divided house and its ‘failed’ governance model in Karnataka. Meanwhile, the BJP is focusing on what it’s best at — seat-by-seat micro-management with its solid organisational machinery and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s popular appeal.

Mysore MP Pratap Simha is spending most of his time campaigning in Varuna — an assembly constituency that falls outside his Lok Sabha boundaries. Congress heavyweight Siddaramaiah is contesting from this assembly seat, which falls in the Chamarajanagar Lok Sabha constituency.

In order to take on Siddaramaiah in a constituency where Lingayats have a significant presence, the BJP has fielded V. Somanna, a Lingayat leader.

“He (Siddaramaiah) is a minority appeaser and he must lose,” Simha tells ThePrint.

On Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit Mysuru, which is adjacent to Varuna. Union Home Minister and the party’s chief strategist Amit Shah is scheduled to hold a rally in Varuna next week. Siddaramaiah has left it to his son, Yathindra S., the sitting MLA from Varuna, to run the campaign. The BJP is, however, trying to turn so much heat on Siddaramaiah’s turf that the former CM — a popular leader who has been campaigning across the state — has been forced to focus on his own constituency.

In Bengaluru, when ThePrint caught up with BJP MP Tejasvi Surya Wednesday morning, he was rushing out to meet the Naidu community. Meanwhile, BJP leader and former Chhattisgarh chief minister Raman Singh was holding another meeting with Hindi-speaking voters in another locality.

The BJP has deployed about 50 leaders, including MPs and MLAs from different states, to meet and address migrants in Bengaluru. BJP strategists in Bengaluru told ThePrint that a similar constituency-specific strategy is being followed across the state.

Tejasvi Surya tells ThePrint that too much is being read into the exit of former chief minister Jagadish Shettar and former deputy chief minister Laxman Savadi.

“We are a cadre-based party, not a leader-based party,” he says.

Congress leaders also concede that the entry of Shettar and Savadi into the party fold is unlikely to swing Lingayat votes.

“For all you know, they may end up losing in their own constituencies. But the fact is that their defections built a public perception about the BJP losing prominent Lingayat leaders. That helps our narrative. We would have lost those seats anyway. Now we have at least a chance to win and also show that the BJP is disintegrating,” a senior Congress leader confides.

He says that in 2021, when state Congress president D.K. Shivakumar hired DesignBoxed, an election campaign management company founded by Naresh Arora, the latter’s brief was clear — to capture the people’s minds with constant activities and expose the shortcomings in governance.

“You must have seen how the Congress was active on Covid, water, corruption, and a host of other issues. It managed to build on the fault lines in the BJP and constantly kept pressure on the government by exposing corruption cases and misgovernance. It was because of the Congress’s efforts that this 40 per cent commission government tag stuck,” says the Congress leader.

As for public perception, Congress strategists say that they managed to create an impression that the BJP-led government was on its way out. “People may not give votes because they think that it’s a 40 per cent commission government,” a Congress election strategist tells ThePrint. “But it helps in building a mahaul (environment). (It is) the same about the entry of BJP leaders like Shettar and Savadi. They may not bring votes but they have created the impression of an exodus from the BJP. That has also helped in keeping our workers charged.”

The Congress, the strategist says, isn’t a “cadre-based party like the BJP”.

“That’s why it’s important to create an atmosphere where Congress workers and voters come out of their homes,” he says.

The BJP has been battling perception problems right since the formation of the BJP-led government in 2019 — the high command versus Yediyurappa narrative, sidelining of the Lingayat strongman, infighting, corruption charges, misgovernance, and exodus of leaders. But it hopes to change the narrative in the next 10 days before the 10 May polls.

“The Congress has already peaked. It’s going to decline now. PM Modi will change it all in the next 10 days,” a BJP leader tells ThePrint.

The party has scheduled around 20 public meetings and four roadshows by Modi in Karnataka in the next 10 days. But Congress strategists argue that it’s too late for the BJP to make up for the lost ground.

Both sides exude confidence in the success of their strategies but at the same time, both sound diffident.

"Former Delhi deputy CM Sisodia got ex-CJI’s legal opinion on excise policy removed: ED | Delhi News, The Indian Express

Sisodia's lawyers told The Indian Express that the ED case was based on statements recorded under pressure that have nothing to do with the case.

The Enforcement Directorate (ED), in its second supplementary prosecution complaint, has alleged that AAP leader and former Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia had ordered the removal of legal opinion given by former Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi and former Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi who had suggested that status quo of the previous excise policy be maintained.

The ED alleged that the excise policy was “brought in by the leadership of AAP, specifically by Manish Sisodia to continuously generate and channel illegal funds to themselves.” The agency said that the policy “promoted cartel formations through back door, awarded exorbitant wholesale of 12 percent and huge retail profit margin of 185 percent and incentivized other illegal activities on account of criminal conspiracy by Manish Sisodia.”

Special Judge MK Nagpal took cognizance of the ED supplementary prosecution complaint — equivalent to a chargesheet — which was filed against 25 accused persons. However, Sisodia, who was arrested on March 9, has not been arraigned as an accused in this complaint even though his name has been mentioned by the agency.

The ED has largely levelled allegations against Sisodia on the basis of the statement of the AAP leader’s secretary C Arvind who told the agency that he was called to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s residence in March 2021 where the “conspiracy” to give wholesale business to private entities and “fix 12 percent margin” was mentioned in a draft group of ministers report for the first time.

Earlier, an expert committee report was placed in public domain on December 31, 2020 and comments were sought from the public and stakeholders to suggest measures for augmenting the state excise revenue among other measures.

The ED alleged that no such proposal, to fix profit margin and give wholesale business to private entities, was made in the comments received by the public.

Arvind told the ED that “Sisodia asked Rahul Singh, the then Excise Commissioner to submit a Cabinet note incorporating the comments/ suggestions received from public/stakeholders.”

Quoting Arvind’s statement, the ED complaint further stated: “On 28-01-2021, the Cabinet note prepared by Rahul Singh was placed for consideration. On perusing the Note, Dy. CM found that along with the comments from public, the Department had also submitted legal opinion of Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, former CJI Ranjan Gogoi, and others which broadly suggested “status quo” of the then existing excise policy. The Cabinet was unhappy with the Note. Manish Sisodia asked Rahul Singh, the then EC to remove the legal opinion and submit only the comments from public/stakeholders. Rahul Singh was transferred and Sanjay Goel was posted as new Excise Commissioner.”

Also under investigation is the company M/s Pixie Enterprises Pvt Ltd which is “effectively owned by Raghav Magunta”, the son of YSR Congress Party MP Magunta Srinivasulu Reddy, who is also under investigation by the ED.

The agency claimed that the company had won “Zone-32 i.e. the airport zone in the bidding” and bid Rs 30 crore Earnest Money Deposit (EMD). However, the licence could not be finalised since it could not obtain a no-objection certificate from the airport. The ED complaint stated that “the EMD amount was refunded to them suo motu by Manish Sisodia without any proposal from the Excise Dept and without the approval of the Council of Ministers who only ratified it at a later stage.”

According to the ED complaint, “This is another undue favour done by a leader of the AAP to a member of the South Group. As per the Delhi Excise Rules 2010, the EMD of the successful bidder who is unable to start the operations within 90 days, shall be forfeited. Contrary to these rules Sh Manish Sisodia provided an exception by making this decision in the pre bid queries.”

Sisodia’s lawyers told The Indian Express that the ED case was based on statements recorded under pressure that have nothing to do with the case. “The ED has no case against Manish Sisodia. These are all statements extracted under pressure. This is a politically motivated case. The missing cabinet note has no FIR or even a complaint…this allegation was made by the officer under pressure from the L-G office and Chief Secretary,” Sisodia’s lawyers said.

The BJP government has distorted text books by insulting Basavanna and Kuvempu,” according to the manifesto.

While stating that the reservation quota matrix would be increased to 75% to accommodate the hopes of SC, ST, OBC and minorities, the party promised to restore the reservation quota of 4% to Muslims, which has been scrapped by the BJP government.

The Congress announced that it will repeal all “unjust and anti-people laws” passed by the BJP government within one year besides repealing the anti-farmers laws enacted by the BJP government. It has also announced that all “politically motivated” cases against farmers will be withdrawn.

“Firm action would be taken against individuals and organisations that spread hatred among communities on the basis of caste and community. Congress believes law is sacrosanct, and they cannot be violated by Bajrang Dal and PFI.”

Accusing the BJP government of pursuing anti-labour policies, the Congress announced that it will repeal the amendment to Factories Act to increase working time from 8 hours to 12 hours daily.

It alleged that only to derive power, the BJP’s main focus was to polarise people. However, Congress believes in equal development and social justice for which ₹10,000 crore would be allocated for welfare of minorities, and preservation of places of worship, the manifesto said.

While Congress has already announced the Gruhalakshmi, Anna Bhagya, Yuvanidhi, Shakthi and Gruhajyothi “guarantees”, which would be implemented in the first cabinet meeting, the party announced region and sector specific promises in its manifesto.

While the party has promised specific timelines for conducting elections to all local bodies, it has said that transport workers would be treated on a par with government workers.

"Express View on BJP’s Karnataka manifesto: High on Hindutva | The Indian Express

Manifestos are usually academic exercises and with just nine days left for polling, this one is hardly the document that can fire the imagination of Karnataka that, by most accounts, is looking for change.

The BJP manifesto for Karnataka polls released Monday is a mixture of Hindutva demands and welfare promises. However, it hardly echoes the aspirational pitch Prime Minister Narendra Modi makes at his election rallies in the state though he has described the manifesto as “development-centric”. Nor does it meet the demands of a state that has been falling behind even among its southern neighbours in human development indices, including for health, education, nutrition etc. Releasing the manifesto, party president J P Nadda said: “Our manifesto is a vision document for a developed Karnataka. It encompasses a forward looking approach and promises to fulfil the aspirations of everyone in Karnataka.” It’s hard to see how. There are the stock promises straight from the polarisation playbook, coming in the wake of the debates on hijab, Muslim reservation etc. As for welfare and development initiatives, they seem more like a response to the criticism that the Basavaraj Bommai government achieved little in office.

On top of the list of promises is a Uniform Civil Code and a National Register of Citizens (NRC). Why would Karnataka, a southern state with no international border, be keen on an NRC considering that the exercise is meant to identify illegal migrants? The party has also promised to set up a panel “to grant complete autonomy of temple administration to devotees”, and regulate “local businesses around temples to create a sustainable temple economy”. The temple economy reference comes in the backdrop of Hindutva groups demanding that the government must “ban” Muslims from running shops on temple premises, or setting up shops during temple fairs. These promises, like the campaign pitch around laws concerning cattle slaughter ban and conversion and Muslim quotas, may resonate among the BJP’s core base. However, these are unlikely to stave off anti-incumbency in the more middle-of-the-road voter struggling with a sluggish economy, lack of decent jobs, and crumbling public infrastructure. The welfare assurances like free LPG cylinders and milk are more of an attempt to account for previous postures. Take the promise of half litre of Nandini milk daily to BPL families under Poshan Yojana. This has the trappings of a defensive gesture since the Opposition had charged — with more rhetoric than fact — that the BJP government planned to merge the state-run Karnataka Milk Federation’s Nandini dairy brand with Gujarat’s Amul. Similarly, the promise of Atal Aahara Kendras to provide “affordable, quality and hygienic food” in every municipal ward is just reiteration of a 2018 item — Annapoorna canteen — that did not take off. The Indira Canteens, set up in 2017 across Bengaluru when Siddaramaiah was the chief minister, are in a poor shape.

Manifestos are usually academic exercises and with just nine days left for polling, this one is hardly the document that can fire the imagination of a state that, by most accounts, is looking for change. That said, the BJP is likely to bank on its formidable organisational clout and resources and, of course, its central leadership’s energy and the PM’s personal push to stave off anti-incumbency. A report card of its five years in office will be what matters — this manifesto is postscript, at best."

A new year and a new desi face at the Met Gala. Alia Bhatt made her grand entry at this year's gala in New York. For her debut look, the actress opted for a pristine white gown with a billowing silhouette from the shelves of Prabal Gurung. The theme for the year ""Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty."" The exhibit celebrates the legacy of iconic designer who died in 2019. Coming back to Alia's ensemble - the gown is detailed with pearls throughout and she wore a single glove; pearls and gloves were two of Karl Lagerfeld's signature elements. The actress' hair was styled immaculately and she finished her look with statement earrings and minimal make-up. In short, Alia Bhatt slayed in her debut Met Gala appearance. Ahead of her big red carpet moment, Alia teased her Instafam with a silhouette shot and she wrote: ""And here we go.""

"How Priyanka Chopra in black and Alia Bhatt in white made South Asia the talking point at the Met Gala | Lifestyle News,The Indian Express

The outing by the two actors was not just about South Asian representation, it was about owning it with a defiance

The Met Gala is not just a battle for representation, it is the global cultural confluence that crowns the new monarchs of celebrityhood. It is not just about a tokenism for inclusivity and diversity — Black, white and all shades in between — but as actors Priyanka Chopra and Alia Bhatt showed, it is about forcing you to sit up and take notes, not just look through them for the next costume in a ball. It is not about wetting feet and testing waters anymore, it is about landing and staking a rightful claim for the South Asian people, who make 20 per cent of the world’s population. Perhaps Chopra’s line from her OTT hit show Citadel —- “Do I look like a woman who would work for the minor league?” — summarises how our actor-icons are not willing to settle for anything less. Or be appropriated by what the West thinks they should be. Having suffered enough of cultural invasion, both Priyanka and Alia are taking the genre of Western spy thrillers by the horns, becoming action heroes themselves. Being a woman is just incidental.

Priyanka Chopra, who has had trailblazing outings at the gala — which this time was a tribute to fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld — was classic chic with her thigh-high slit and an off shoulder black gown by Valentino. For the first time, she wasn’t over-the-top, experimental or trying to announce her entry; she seamlessly glided in. At the other end was Met debutante Alia Bhatt, in a pearl-encrusted white gown with a billowing silhouette and a Lagerfeld-inspired white glove. Traipsing in with designer Prabal Gurung, she not only looked self-assured and elegant, she turned heads without being a screamer.

Refreshingly, the two actors, with businesswoman Isha Ambani Piramal in a pearl-encrusted black sari gown, have redefined the image of what the Brown girl is. Certainly not the one to be confined in a ring, or a cross between the Black and White. In a world of images, they are rewriting their story, creating new standards of beauty and benchmarking new geographies, being wholly Indian and not just of Indian origin. The most populous country in the world deserves that right.

Of course, many would claim that democracy hardly matters in a high-brow event, where marking a presence means establishing your relevance, and whose tickets are bought by brands, businesses, film studios, fashion houses and lobbyists. But whoever invested in either Priyanka or Alia knows that they are marquee assets. They have been big revenue churners of the film industry and their brands. We may like to claim Priyanka Chopra as the desi girl of Bollywood going on Hollywood, but she is probably living her best Miss World moment now. As the feisty identity-shifting protagonist and spy-hero of Citadel, she is every woman who can stand up to every man and dazzle all with her sassy brilliance. With her newly adopted marital home in the US, celebrating Diwali and Holi with the same free-spiritedness of a Christmas and Easter, sharing spices in the kitchen and dancing to Bollywood beats, Chopra has been uninhibited about her multi-cultural symbolism. And since she has done it with consistent ease, documenting it on social media, she has converted the awkwardness of the minority into the confidence of a mainstream statement.

Alia Bhatt, who has wrapped up all awards for her acting chops at home, may melt Hollywood’s Heart of Stone enough to show that can chew up a meaty role with a bite-sized ease.

Perhaps, this may not be the fairest bit of representation yet but has set off a juggernaut bent on changing the contours of Americanism to include the soon-to-be most populous country in the world. In 2017, South Asia at the Met Gala was all about a picture tweeted by British-Pakistani actor Riz Ahmed, where he stood with comedians Mindy Kaling, Aziz Ansari and Hasan Minhaj. Subsequently, we know how Kaling and Ansari, both first-generation Indian-Americans, got two major TV shows – ‘The Mindy Project’ and ‘Master of None’ – respectively with Kaling starring in many films. Of course, there were actor Dev Patel, jazz musician Vijay Iyer and singer Zayn Malik, who never underplayed their south Asian identity but managed to get out of the box. In fact, Patel had to play South Asian characters before he received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor in 2021 for an adaptation of Charles Dickens’ The Personal History of David Copperfield. Social media platforms like youtube have been starmakers for Canadian Indian artistes like Lilly Singh, who are challenging cultural biases through humour. Now there are the likes of Maitreyi Ramakrishnan, Avantika Vandanapu, and ‘Bridgerton’ star Simone Ashley, who are demanding front row allegiance with rounded storylines and the fullness of human emotions regardless of where you come from. The origin is just an added layer of vibrancy, not the defining aspect.

However, Priyanka Chopra, who played an FBI agent in the ABC series Quantico, and made neat appearances in Hollywood films thereafter, chose to be mainstream from the word go. As Alexandra Parrish and now Nadia Sinh, she has shown her name-defying looks can have takers in both the East and West. At a pre-Oscar party of South Asian actors, which she had hosted to unite those who were “demanding representation when no one was giving into them,” she had said their moment was not too far. For both Priyanka and Alia, this was their moment.

The IPL 2023 schedule was altered owing to the assembly elections in Karnataka on May 10, and RCB, who are sixth in the standings with four victories from eight games, have played six of their seven home games. The team’s following five games will be played away from home. The team dinner at the RCB cafe was attended by Vini Raman, Glenn Maxwell, Anushka Sharma, and Virat Kohli.

Bangalore’s reliance on Faf du Plessis, Virat Kohli, and Glenn Maxwell to carry the load in the batting department has been excessive. Their middle-order batters have utterly flopped and have yet to contribute anything to the team.Du Plessis, who now has the Orange Cap, has 422 runs scored in eight games. Virat Kohli, his opening partner, sits behind him in second place with 333 runs to his credit.

Due to a rib injury issue, Faf du Plessis has appeared as an impact replacement in the previous three games. In his absence, Kohli took charge and guided the team to victory against Rajasthan and Punjab Kings. RCB dropped their most recent game on Wednesday at home against the Kolkata Knight Riders.

In our family, there are five eligible women under the scheme. We had asked the local AAP leaders several times as to when would we get the money. Their reply was – ask Punjab chief minister and Arvind Kejriwal,"" says Joginder Kaur, a woman from kartarpur

It’s not just the Opposition parties that are tearing into AAP over not keeping its word on providing Rs 1,000 each to all women above 18 years as promised by the party in the run-up to the 2022 Punjab Assembly elections but several eligible women are also speaking out against AAP dragging its feet on the promise.

Joginder Kaur, a woman from Kartarpur, said that last year before the assembly elections, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had launched a formal registration of women from Punjab regarding his promise of crediting Rs 1,000 into the account of every woman who is 18 and above. But till date no-one has got that money while he had promised to give it immediately after forming the government.

“Kejriwal ne keha see main Apne Kapdeyan dee parvah ni karda par main chaunda han ki tusi sariyan pehli installment naal Apne bhra vallon change suit kharido (Kejriwal had said then – I don’t bother about my clothes, but I want you all to get good suits for yourself from the first installment from your brother),” Joginder Kaur said, adding that “hun tan 14 kishtan ban gaian hun par ikk bhi nahin ditti (Now 14 installments are lying pending and not a single
one was credited into our accounts).

She said, “In our family, there are five eligible women under the scheme. We had asked the local AAP leaders several times as to when would we get the money. The local leaders’ reply was – ask Punjab chief minister and Arvind Kejriwal.”

Kejriwal had started the registration from Sarai Khas village under Kartarpur assembly segment in Jalandhar district on December 7, 2021, and a large number of women had gathered at the village then and thanked Kejriwal for the scheme.

Kejriwal had announced this to women from Moga district – that if AAP is voted to power, then every 18+ woman will get Rs 1,000 every month in their accounts.

Sarabjit Kaur (34) of Udhowal, a worker under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), said, “The AAP workers had made us fill the forms, asked for our WhatsApp numbers (which we provided) so that we can get the message of credited money in our accounts. But till date, nothing has been credited to our accounts. Now, if they (AAP leaders) come to our village for electioneering, we will ask them about the money.”

Balwinder Kaur (of Dyalpur village), a member of Pendu Mazdoor Union, said that “all women of her village are waiting for the AAP leaders to come to their village so that they could question them about the money”.

Before the Punjab Assembly elections, the AAP leaders were so desperate that “they took our phone numbers and bank account numbers, but after forming the government, the ruling party leaders just vanished into thin air, no-one from AAP ever contacted us. We want our pending dues to be cleared first and then this promised installment should come into our account every month”, Balwinder Kaur added.

Pooja Rani from Jalandhar’s Santokhpura area also said that several women in their locality had filled the forms, but regretted that the process didn’t serve any purpose."

Samantha and her ex-beau Naga Chaitanya had separated in October 2021.

Naga Chaitanya often grabs headlines for his divorce from Samantha Ruth Prabhu. The duo had been married for nearly four years. The actor is currently rumoured to be dating Ponniyin Selvan actress Sobhita Dhulipala. Now ahead of the release of his upcoming film Custody, Chaitanya opens up about the “biggest regret"" in his life.

During a fun segment of truth or dare with YouTuber Irfan’s View, Chaitanya was asked about his biggest regret. To which, Chaitanya said, “There are no regrets in my life, bro.

This comes after his brother Akhil Akkineni reacted for the first time to Chaitanya’s dating rumours with Sobhita Dhulipala. Chaitanya and Samantha Ruth Prabhu announced their separation in October 2021.

During a press conference of his latest film ‘Agent,’ Akhil was reportedly asked about Chaitanya’s viral photo with Sobhita from London. Recently, a photo of the rumoured lovebirds took the internet by storm. In the picture, Chaitanya is posing with a chef while Sobhita is seen seated behind, seemingly covering her face.

According to a report in Cinejosh.com, Akhil apparently said that during that time he was “busy"" transforming his physique working in the gym for his role in Agent and so he had “no idea"" about Chaitanya and Sobhita’s alleged relationship.

Chaitanya and Sobhita have been dating for “at least six months now,"" according to a recent report in Hyderabad Times.

Apparently, Chaitanya and Sobhita bonded over their “love for Formula 1"". “As they spent more time together, their friendship turned into love. They’re very comfortable in each other’s company but don’t want to make anything official yet. Right now, they’re just enjoying getting to know each other better,” a source had earlier said.

"Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh is no saint. But BJP has reasons to look away from wrestlers’ protest

Modi didn’t mention wrestlers in Sunday’s Mann ki Baat. But the message was unmistakable: his govt’s women empowerment record can't be blemished by partymen's alleged misdeeds.

There was a message in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Mann ki Baat Sunday for wrestlers, including Olympian medalists, sitting on dharna at Delhi’s Jantar Mantar. They are demanding action against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, Wrestling Federation of India president and Bharatiya Janata Party parliamentarian, accusing him of sexually harassing women wrestlers over the past decade. BJP has maintained a studied silence. It took the Supreme Court’s intervention for the Delhi Police to act on their complaints and lodge FIRs against the Bahubali MP from Uttar Pradesh’s Kaisarganj.

In the 100th edition of his monthly radio programme, Modi appeared to have broken that silence—subtly but loudly. It came in the form of the “hundreds of inspiring stories” of women empowerment from “our Army or the sports world”, references to the Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao scheme that he had launched from Haryana and the Selfie with Daughter campaign started by a Haryana resident, Sunil Jaglan, who featured in Sunday’s programme and credited Modi for starting “the fourth battle of Panipat to bring smiles on the faces of daughters”. Incidentally, the protesting wrestlers also hail from Haryana.

Of course, Modi made no mention of the wrestlers or their protests in the Mann ki Baat radio programme on Sunday. But the message was unmistakable: his government has a stellar record in women’s empowerment, and it can’t be blemished by the alleged misdeeds of his partymen. Now it is wrestlers’ words versus Modi’s words, full stop.

Thanks to the welfare schemes launched by the Modi government since 2014, as also the PM’s popularity, more women have started veering toward BJP. As per the 2019 Lokniti-CSDS post-poll survey, the percentage of women who voted for BJP increased to 36 per cent in the 2019 Lok Sabha election from 29 per cent in 2014. For Congress, the figures stood at 20 per cent and 19 per cent, respectively. Eleven per cent of the women who had voted for Congress in 2014 shifted to BJP in 2019.

If you saw Modi’s roadshow in Bengaluru on Saturday, you might think that recent controversies over the alleged misdeeds of BJP legislators haven’t had much bearing on Modi’s popularity among women. From Magadi Road to Nice Road, I saw groups of women standing or sitting on pavements and waiting for Modi for over two hours. As his roadshow started, many ran excitedly to get a closer look at him.

Aside, Karnataka has had one of the worst records when it comes to the representation of women in the assembly. Its best tally was in 2018, when seven women MLAs were elected to the 224-member assembly.

It’s unlikely to get much better in the next assembly. BJP and Congress have fielded 12 and 9 women candidates, respectively, in this election.

Coming to the Bengaluru roadshow, the enthusiastic response of women only suggests Modi’s popularity among them—or probably their curiosity about him. By no means can it be taken as any indication of a lack of empathy with the wrestlers protesting in Delhi. For all we know, most of them might not even be aware of what’s happening roughly 2,200 kilometres away. I am citing their response only to contextualise why PM Modi putting himself in the front and putting forth his initiatives for women’s empowerment in the Mann ki Baat programme provides a shield to his party and government from the alleged acts of commission or omission by party colleagues like Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh. Or, for that matter, Haryana minister Sandeep Singh who was accused of sexually harassing a woman coach and continues to enjoy the support of Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar and the party leadership.

That brings us to the question of why BJP should risk alienating or upsetting Modi voters by being seen as defending or condoning the serious alleged crimes of its leaders with silence. Latest allegations aside, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh is no saint. Senior advocate Kapil Sibal told the Supreme Court last week that there were 40 cases against Singh.

Last December, an MP-MLA court acquitted him in a 29-year-old case of attempt to murder former UP minister Vinod Kumar Singh. The court, however, pulled up the investigators for making no effort to collect evidence.

In an interview with The Lallantop last year, Brij Bhushan Singh admitted on camera: “Mere Jeevan mein mere haath se ek hatya hui hai. Log kuchh bhi kahen, maine ek hatya ki hai (I have committed one murder in my life. Whatever people may say, I have committed one murder).”

He spent several months in jail under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Act (TADA) in the mid-1990s for allegedly helping underworld don Dawood Ibrahim’s men.

Last year, he even criticised the Yogi Adityanath-led UP government for “shoddy preparations” for floods, saying, “Public representatives are silent. Speaking is disallowed. If you speak, you will be termed a rebel.”

So, why would BJP continue to protect Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh? He enjoys immense political clout, for sure. He is a six-term MP from three different constituencies – Gonda, Balrampur, and Kaisarganj — and has a following among Rajputs in two-three other adjoining constituencies. He was also part of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement and was an accused in the Babri demolition case. That makes Singh a much sought-after BJP leader. The party may also be conscious of the fact that any action against him may affect its prospects in urban local body elections on 4 and 11 May.

Another reason could be sheer chutzpah or BJP’s over-confidence about its ability to build public perception. No matter the allegations against its leaders, the ruling party chooses to brazen it out, refusing to take any action against them and ignoring public outcry. When there was public outrage over Union minister Ajay Mishra’s son, Ashish, allegedly killing protesting farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri in 2022, BJP simply ignored it. The junior home minister has continued to enjoy the high command’s support. So has Haryana minister Sandeep Singh, following sexual harassment allegations. CM Khattar even called the allegation “absurd” during police investigations.

The party has similarly chosen to look the other way when Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh is under fire. A party with a popular prime minister at the helm can probably afford to show disregard for public sentiments against some of its leaders. In an era of transactional politics, party strategists may even feel that a handful of wrestlers alleging sexual harassment won’t have any electoral fallout. As always, PM Modi is willing to stake his own image for the benefit of his party. The big question is whether it will help or hurt BJP in the long run.

"Union government’s indifference towards protesting wrestlers is baffling | Deccan Herald

Imagine if Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) head Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh — accused by seven women, including a minor, of sexual harassment — was not a Member of Parliament belonging to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) — how would have the law caught up with him? Would there have been propaganda unleashed against those who have accused him by labelling them

Imagine if Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) head Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh — accused by seven women, including a minor, of sexual harassment — was not a Member of Parliament belonging to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) — how would have the law caught up with him? Would there have been propaganda unleashed against those who have accused him by labelling them ‘anti-government’?

In a cruel sense, Singh is lucky that he belongs to the BJP, because otherwise he might have even been in jail by now. Even a Supreme Court intervention has not prompted the Delhi Police to arrest him.

Instead of feeling ashamed, he is holding press conferences, accusing the Congress and wrestlers of conspiring against him to discredit him.

This is symptomatic of the malaise which has inflicted the police system (and even threatens the judicial system), which, if allowed to continue, can lead to its collapse. It smacks of partisanship of the highest order, and exposes the hypocrisy of a government which gloats about its programme focused on the girl child: Beti Padao, Beti Bachao. This also reflects the fact that some of those who take great pride in the Hindu ethos of very exalted status of women and quote the shloka, ‘yatra naryastu pujyante, ramante tatra devata’ (where women are honoured, divinity blossoms there) are duplicitous in practice.

In case of sexual harassment, the law is explicit that the word of the woman is sufficient to arrest the accused. A sexual harassment charge is criminal in nature, and the wheels of justice should have moved immediately; instead, the government formed a committee led by renowned boxer Mary Kom to probe the allegations. This could have been justified if intent of the government was to get to the bottom of the matter to cleanse the system, and put things in order so that no women athlete would face the same ignominy in future. Unfortunately, the intent was to find a political solution. The strategy did not work, and it is not surprising that the athletes are unhappy with the conduct of the Union government.

The Union government has further exposed itself by not making public the findings of the committee report, which was submitted in first week of April. Babita Phogat, a member of the committee, has alleged that she was not allowed to read the report, and that the report was snatched away from her before she could glance through. If true, this further increases the intentions of the government. If the government was serious about the problem, it should have not only published the report, but also acted by now.

Dissatisfied with the government’s response, the protesting wrestlers knocked on the Supreme Court’s door, where the Delhi Police unashamedly has said that if the court desired an FIR could be lodged the same day itself. It took four months and prodding from the top court for the Delhi Police to file two FIRs, both naming Singh.

It is obvious that the police is not interested in pursuing this case — but what is it that makes it so brazen?

Ideally, the police should have arrested Singh in January itself. But two things worked for him. One, he is a BJP MP who is supposedly very close to a powerful minister in the Union Cabinet. Two, he belongs to the politically-powerful community of the Rajputs. The Rajputs in Uttar Pradesh are very influential, and the BJP does not want to upset the community. Singh himself is a seasoned leader, and can impact electoral fortunes of the BJP in four/five Lok Sabha seats around Gonda district.

A third reason is that the Delhi Police is allegedly a compromised force. Many senior officers in it are either eyeing post-retirement sinecures or are those who toe the government’s ideological line without questioning. These police officers either do not take cognisance of complaints/cases against the ruling alliance, or when it does, it is not in a hurry to do its job.

A few years back when a few masked men and women unleashed violence in front of the TV cameras in JNU and later, when a few were identified as ABVP activists by a TV channel, the Delhi Police did precious little. More than a dozen Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLAs and leaders were arrested on frivolous charges. In most cases the courts were livid about the way the investigation was carried out. Most of them were exonerated by the courts. In the past, the police has not taken notice of the provocative statements made by BJP leaders such as Anurag Thakur, Parvesh Verma, and Kapil Mishra. Serious allegations were levelled against the Delhi Police during the 2020 Delhi riots in which 53 persons lost their lives (two-third of which were Muslims). During the investigations into the riots even lawyers who were helping the Muslim community were intimidated, and their houses were raided.

It is not surprising that the Delhi Police has not taken any action based on the wrestlers’ complaint. What is surprising is its audacity. Despite the apex court’s intervention, it is disinclined to arrest Singh. This is not possible unless the Delhi Police has clear instructions from up the hierarchy. Is it a coincidence that the Delhi Police reports to the Union government and Amit Shah is the Home Minister?

"Aishwarya Lekshmi: ‘There is some level of unfairness towards indigenous empires of India’ | Entertainment News,The Indian Express

During the promotion of Ponniyin Selvan 2, Aishwarya Lekshmi said that there's inadequate information about Indian empires in our history text books.

Aishwarya Lekshmi, who played the role of Poonguzhali in Ponniyin Selvan films, recently said that Indian textbooks and school education don’t cover the history of indigenous empires of the country enough. She said that it is an effort to even acquire little details about Indian kings.

The actor was quoted as saying, “From what I know, yes there has been some level of unfairness towards the indigenous empires of India. It would take a lot of research to get a little bit of information about them. Kalki’s novel ‘Ponniyin Selvan’ (on which the Mani Ratnam magnum opus is based) is actually a window to the 10th century of southern India, how progressive we were at that time and how much chasing westernisation led us to go back in time.”

On the other hand, actor Karthi, who played the role of Vallavarayan Vandhiyathevan in the films, said that the syllabus needs a holistic coverage of Indian history and said that a panel of intellectuals must decide on what is the best history syllabus for school students.

Recently, content on Islamic rulers suffered deep cuts in sweeping changes made to textbooks by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT). This has sparked a heated debate in the country.

Meanwhile, Ponniyin Selvan 2, which concludes the adaptation of the historical-fiction series by Kalki Krishnamurthy, has opened to an overwhelming response from the audience. It has already raked in Rs 100 crore from across the world in a matter of two days. Directed by Mani Ratnam, the story is a fictitious account of Raja Raja Cholan’s ascent to the crown in the 1oth century."

"Ponniyin Selvan 2 box office day 4 Mani Ratnam film Rs 200 cr

Ponniyin Selvan 2 box office day 4: Mani Ratnam's magnum opus registered a double-digit collection on its first Monday. Globally, it has crossed over Rs 200 cr within four days of release.

The first weekend of Ponniyin Selvan 2 proved fruitful. The epic drama film managed to collect a decent total of Rs 80 crore in its opening three days in theatres. Now, it has passed the all-important first Monday test as well, as it registered a double-digit collection on day four. Director Mani Ratnam’s magnum opus has earned Rs 24 crore on its fourth day, reported industry tracker Sacnilk. With this, the film has crossed the coveted Rs 100 cr mark as its total domestic collection currently stands at Rs 105.02 cr.

PS 2 has been receiving a good response in the Tamil-speaking belt of the country. On Monday, the region witnessed an occupancy of 58.04%. In the Hindi-speaking belt, the film’s occupancy was recorded to be 14.21%. It got 34.39% Malayalam and 25.66% Telugu occupancy.

Worldwide, the film, which is based on Kalki Krishnamurthy’s five-part novel series, has crossed the Rs 200 cr mark. Actor Chiyaan Vikram, who plays the role of Aditha Karikalan in the movie, shared on Twitter, “Breaking barriers & soaring high. ⚔️ #ps2 #PonniyinSelvan2.”

Film trade analyst Manobala Vijayabalan had noted on Monday, that the movie will cross the lifetime collection of two of the biggest Tamil hits, Beast and Varisu. He wrote on Twitter, “Today #PonniyinSelvan part 2 will CROSS the lifetime collection of #Beast[₹153.64 cr] & #Varisu[₹195.20 cr].”

With no competition in sight and good word of mouth, Ponniyin Selvan 2 is expected to grow further in the coming days. Indianexpress.com’s Kirubhakar Purushothaman wrote in a section of his review, “After watching Ponniyin Selvan 2, one can say that the first part was Mani’s way of introducing and establishing the epic, where he didn’t shy away from using screen time for lavish song sequences. In the second part, he is bolder and deviates majorly from the books. Here, Mani Ratnam, the filmmaker, is more faithful to his craft than to the written material. This makes Ponniyin Selvan 2 better cinema, and superior to its first part.”

PS 2 stars Vikram, Karthi, Jayam Ravi, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Trisha, Aishwarya Lekshmi, Sobhita Dhulipala, Prakash Raj, Jayaram, Prabhu, R Sarathkumar, Parthiban, Rahman, and Vikram Prabhu."

Hardik's leadership a reason why GT converting their half-chances: Manoj Tiwary

We've seen two games today where similar sort of targets needed to be chased. Gujarat chased it down on a canter while Delhi stumbled along the way with a few bizzare tactical decisions. Speaks a lot on how the backroom management and environment might be at both those franchises. Hopefully, DC can fix things soon for the sake of a competitive IPL, but till then this is Saurabh Shankar, signing off on behalf of Nikhil Jadhav, Ramakrishnan MS and Venky.

Match Highlights: DC v SRH, Tata IPL 2023, Match 40

Mitch Marsh | Player of the Match: Took me a few games to get going, but a dissapointing loss. Had that nice partnership with Salt but not enough to get over the line. The wicket did slow down a bit, but I think it was a case of us chasing 20 too many either way. And they were really good. It was all about getting the boundaries, applying the pressure. Certainly lots of positives from today, we've lost a few close ones. We've been on the wrong end of a few but we do feel there is a long way to go in this tournament. Time to start winning a few.

Aiden Markram: Great team effort, good to see the guys show good skills and character. I don't mind getting things wrong if the approach is right. It helps to see such performances, the guys will see that results are there to be had. Credit to the way the team has responded. Klassy has been in great form, and Abhishek did the hard work early on. Klassy backs himself to play that way, good to see it pay off. We needed wickets to get back in the game, the two were doing well and it needed a special catch from Mayank. Fortunately, the ball was stopping a bit and the bowlers showed great character to execute their spoils. This win will give great confidence, now we travel back home and try to build on this.

Teams batting first have now won 10 out of the last 11 games in the IPL.

SRH bowling today: Pace: 9-0-101-2 | ER: 11.22 Spin: 11-0-86-4 | ER: 7.81

DCâ€™s run-chase: Overs 1-10: 105/1 | RR: 10.5 Overs 11-17: 44/5 | RR: 6.33 Overs 18-20: 39/0 | RR: 13

DC vs SRH last six results Abu Dhabi, 2020 - DC won by 17 runs Chennai, 2021 - Scores tied, DC won the Super Over Dubai, 2021 - DC won by eight wickets Brabourne, 2022 - DC won by 21 runs Hyderabad, 2023 - DC won by 7 runs Delhi, 2023 - SRH won by 9 runs

Heinrich Klaasen: About time I did something in IPL, pleased about it. Was a good team effort, glad the batters played with freedom, good signs to come. We got the players to do it up front, hopefully we can take this result and form in the next game. I have to fit in (playing well against spinners), you have to adapt, can't be one dimensional. The wicket was starting to hold a bit more, and it also spun a bit. Back of a length kept balls skidding on, so we asked our bowlers to drag back the length and make it difficult for their batters. He (Abhishek Sharma) has been bowling well in the nets, asked him to try and spin the ball as much he can.

David Warner: We were off a bit with the ball, but I think Mitch Marsh bowled fantastic. He was our best bowler. To come up 9 runs short is disappointing. I don't think the pitch slowed down a lot, they took pace off. When you lose wickets in the middle it can be extremely difficult. He's (Axar) in good touch. For us it was about, we get off to a good start and we know that him and me will have to handle their spinners with the ball spinning back in. Holding Axar can be difficult. We have been losing too many wickets through the middle.

Cricbuzz Live Hindi: Match 40: Delhi v Hyderabad, Post-match show

23:10 Local Time, 17:40 GMT, 23:10 IST: These two sides have traded away victories against each other. A clinical performance from SRH, who found their death bowling mojo once again through Natarajan and Bhuvi Kumar. They started the innings by dismissing the dangerous Warner for a duck, but then DC added a 112-run partnership between Mitch Marsh and Phil Salt. The duo looked like they'd take the game away, but shortly after the halfway stage the wickets began to tumble. Neither of the two set batters could continue for much longer after their fifties, and the pitch got slower to make things tough. Puzzling tactics from DC as well who kept holding Axar back to play into SRH's match-ups. A sense of relief for Markram and his boys, who got back to winning ways, with Abhishek Sharma and Klaasen setting up this win with first innings fifties. Over to the presentations now...

DC: 188-6 after 20 overs

19.6 Bhuvneshwar to Ripal Patel, FOUR, full outside off, Ripal takes a blind swing and gets an outside edge that flies away towards the third-man boundary. SRH arrest their slide, valuable points for the visitors!!

19.5 Bhuvneshwar to Axar, 1 run, low full toss, driven towards long-off

We'll need a new ball. Hang tight...

19.4 Bhuvneshwar to Axar, SIX, back of length and pulled well into the stands over mid-wicket by Axar. If only a few of these could have come earlier, or he could have come out to bat earlier...

19.3 Bhuvneshwar to Ripal Patel, 1 run, once again Bhuvi goes yorker, dug out towards long-on. Now the target is beyond reach...

19.2 Bhuvneshwar to Axar, 1 run, this time the yorker is spot on. Turned to deep square. Just a single, these won't hurt SRH

19.2 Bhuvneshwar to Axar, wide, once again the attempted yorker goes down leg

19.2 Bhuvneshwar to Axar, wide, attempted yorker, goes down leg

Six needed, can Axar deliver!!

19.1 Bhuvneshwar to Ripal Patel, 1 run, pace off and full outside off, heaved towards long-on - gets to him on the bounce"

Bottom of the table Delhi Capitals (DC) take on the defending champions Gujarat Titans (GT) at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on May 2. DC lost their last game to SRH in Delhi and are firmly rooted to the bottom of the table with their playoff hopes all but gone. They would need to run of victories to just make it off the bottom of the table let alone the playoffs.

David Warner’s men were on the up and were slowly building momentum before the loss to SRH. Batting is still a big weakness for DC but their bowlers have improved in the last few games and ensured a couple of victories for them. Less than a week ago DC and SRH locked horns in Hyderabad and DC came out on top. But in the reverse fixture in Delhi, the DC bowlers were hit all over the park as SRH scored 197/6. Phil Salt, Mitch Marsh and Axar Patel did their best for DC but the other batters did not contribute enough and DC fell short of the target by 9 runs, their sixth loss in eight games this season.

So far this season DC have lost to LSG, GT, RR, MI and RCB. They finally got their first win of the season against KKR in Delhi after five consecutive losses. Which was then followed by the double header against SRH.

Batting is still a worry for the side from the capital. DC have lost wickets in clumps in all of their games so far and their middle-order has seemed extremely fragile and vulnerable all season. This was once again evident in the loss to SRH as DC slipped from 112/1 to 148/6.

Warner is one of the leading run-scorers this season with 306 runs with four half-centuries but his strike rate of 119 is a concern. He has been struggling to score runs at rapid rate and the team losing wickets in heaps around him has not helped his cause.

Prithvi Shaw has had a woeful season so far. He has only scored 47 runs so far this season. Head coach Ricky Ponting has recently said that Shaw has not been good enough this season and currently the team is better off without him. Sarfaraz has once again failed to deliver on his promising domestic form and is running out of time to realise his potential. Marsh and Salt both scored their first half-centuries of the season against SRH in the last game and DC were on their way to chase down the score but once again the domestic middle order batters let the team down. Axar Patel has so far scored 211 runs this season. He is the only other batter to have made a notable contribution to the team's batting efforts other than skipper Warner.

Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav have both picked up 7 wickets this season at an economy of seven. Marsh has also contributed with seven scalps after his four wickets against SRH. Nortje has picked up six and Mukesh Kumar has picked up five wickets so far but he has conceded more than ten runs an over. Garg is expected to continue in the side after coming in against SRH. Lalit Yadav could come into the side for Ripal Patel and Aman Khan could come in for Sarfaraz.

Yash Dhull, Prithvi Shaw, Pravin Dubey, Chetan Sakariya and Khaleel Ahmed are all Impact player options for DC.

Openers: David Warner (c), Phil Salt (wk).

Middle Order: Aman Khan, Priyam Garg, Manish Pandey.

All-Rounders: Axar Patel, Lalit Yadav, Mitch Marsh.

Bowlers: Kuldeep Yadav, Anrich Nortje, Mukesh Kumar.

DC could use Yash Dhull, Prithvi Shaw, Pravin Dubey, Chetan Sakariya and Khaleel Ahmed for their Impact Player options.

"Karnataka Election: PM Narendra Modi Shreds Congress, Says Its History Is About 'Appeasing Terrorists'

Prime Minister Narendra Modi today alleged that Congress's history is about ""appeasing terror and terrorists"", and the party had questioned the country's defence forces, when the surgical strikes and air strikes had been carried out.

PM Modi today alleged that Congress's history is about ""appeasing terror and terrorists"".

Prime Minister Narendra Modi today alleged that Congress's history is about ""appeasing terror and terrorists"", and the party had questioned the country's defence forces, when the surgical strikes and air strikes had been carried out.

Also accusing the Congress and JD(S) of ""encouraging terror"", the Prime Minister said they can never increase investment in Karnataka and cannot create new opportunities for the youth in the state.

""People of Karnataka should never forget Congress's history and thinking. Congress' history is about appeasing terror and terrorists. When the Batla House encounter happened in Delhi, there were tears in the eyes of Congress' top most leader, hearing about the death of terrorists,"" PM Modi said.

Addressing a public meeting, he said, ""When surgical strikes happened, when air strikes happened, Congress raised questions on the capability of the country's defence forces.""

""In Karnataka you have seen how Congress is encouraging terrorism. Congress had left Karnataka to the 'rehemokaram' (mercy) of terrorists. It is the BJP that broke the back of the terrorists, and has ended the game of appeasement,"" he said, adding that for a prosperous Karnataka and to make it number it is important for the state to be safe.

Congress has lost its warranty and trust of the people, the Prime Minister said, adding that its election guarantee without warranty is nothing but lies.

He also said that BJP's election manifesto has a roadmap to make Karnataka number one State in the country.

Union Minister A Narayanaswamy and Davangere MP GM Siddeshwara among others were present.

"'Shahi parivar' wants to make Karnataka no.1 ATM: PM Modi tears into Congress | Deccan Herald

Stepping up attack on Congress in poll-bound Karnataka, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday said that the 'parivar' (the Gandhis) in Delhi wishes to make Karnataka its no.1 ATM. He added that, in contrast, the BJP wants to take it to new heights.

Coming down heavily on the Congress, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the opposition party wants to make Karnataka ""No. 1 ATM"" for its ""Shahi Parivar"" (royal family) in Delhi.

During the election rally at Kolnad in Mulki, Karnataka on Wednesday, he said, ""Congress, which is eating 85 per cent commission in welfare schemes, will take Karnataka on a reverse gear. The people in Karnataka should be careful about Congress and JD(S).""

Stating that BJP wants to make Karnataka number one state in the country, he said, ""India is the fifth largest economy in the world. To reach the third place, I need the support of the people of Karnataka. Without the people of Karnataka, I cannot go forward. May 10 election will decide the future.""

The PM asked the mammoth gathering to visit every house and tell them that Modi had come all the way from Delhi to Mulki and has sent his 'pranam'. ""Will you send my regards to every house?” he asked.

Also read: Congress expects no fallout over promise to ban Bajrang Dal in Karnataka election manifesto

“If there is instability in Karnataka, your (people's) future will also be unstable. Congress believes in 'divide and rule' policy. Congress is an enemy of peace and development and appeasement policy is the party's identity,” he added.

“Across the country, wherever people want peace and prosperity, they defeated the Congress. The whole nation respects the Army and we are proud of them, but Congress insults our soldiers,” he alleged.

He said PM Matsya Sampada Yojana and Matsya Siri Yojana were implemented for the benefit of the fishermen. ""The BJP is committed to the welfare of the fishermen and their family. Till 2014, inland fisheries and aquaculture production was 60 lakh tonne. The production has increased to more than 120 lakh tonne in the last nine years,"" he said.

Meanwhile, the Congress manifesto that proposed a ban on Bajrang Dal in Karnataka echoed in the BJP election campaign. Modi began his speech with the slogan ‘Bajrangbali ki jai’ and concluded his speech by appealing people gathered at the venue to shout ‘Bajrangbali ki jai’ thrice.

"PHOTOS: DC keep playoff hopes alive with nail-biting win over Gujarat Titans - Rediff Cricket

IMAGES from the IPL 2023 match between Gujarat Titans and Delhi Capitals at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Tuesday

IMAGES from the IPL 2023 match between Gujarat Titans and Delhi Capitals at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Tuesday

Aman Khan's maiden T20 fifty was beautifully complemented by the pacers as Delhi Capitals kept their playoff hopes alive with a tense five-run win over Gujarat Titans in the IPL in Ahmedabad on Tuesday.

Bowling impeccable lengths, Mohammed Shami (4/11 in four overs) was lethal with the new ball as he knocked the wind out of the Capitals' top order, as Gujarat Titans restricted DC to 130 for eight after being asked to bowl.

Aman (51 off 44) waged a lone battle, putting some much-need runs on the board. He added 50 off 54 balls with Axar Patel (27) and 53 off 27 balls with Ripal Patel (23).

In reply, Hardik Pandya's (59 off 53) sedate fifty and Rahul Tewatia's (20) hattrick of sixes were not enough as Delhi bowlers held their nerves to stop the defending champions at 125 for 6.

It was the third win of the season for Delhi, who continue to remain at the bottom of the table, while Gujarat continued to remain on the top spot.

Defending a modest target, Delhi quicks were able to make an early breakthrough, as Gujarat lost three wickets inside the powerplay.

If 'Impact Player' Khaleel Ahmed (2/24) bowled a beautiful first over which was a wicket-maiden, pace spearhead Anrich Nortje (1/39) got rid of the dangerous Shubman Gill (6).

Veteran pacer Ishant Sharma (2/23) too joined the party as he outfoxed Vijay Shankar (6) with a perfectly executed knuckle ball.

Wickets continued to tumble with the introduction of the slow bowlers, left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav (1/15) bamboozled David Miller (0) in the seventh over.

Pandya and Abhinav Manohar (26) steadied the Gujarat ship with 62-run stand for the fifth wicket.

Pandya anchored the innings with Tewatia hitting three back-to-back sixes off the penultimate over. But with 12 needed off the final over, Ishant gave away just six runs while taking the vital wicket of Tewatia.

Earlier, Delhi once again suffered a dramatic collapse, losing five wickets for 23 runs inside five overs and at the centre of it all was Shami.

The veteran Indian pacer set the tone of the match as he struck off the first ball of the game to get Phil Salt for a golden duck.

A horrible mix up between young Priyam Garg (10) and skipper David Warner (2) cost Delhi the wicket of the Australian in the second over.

Rilee Rossouw (8) was next to depart as Shami struck once again. The veteran Indian induced slight movement away from Rossouw. An outside edge led the ball to straight into the hands of wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha's gloves as Delhi fell to 16 for three.

With Shami bowling a tight opening spell, captain Hardik Pandya decided to continue bowling the pacer and the move paid dividends. Shami continued his wicket-taking streak in his third over, snaring two in his final over.

The Indian bowled a wobble seam delivery, tempting Manish Pandey (1) to drive it but the late movement meant the ball found the edge of the bat and Saha completing a stunning one handed catch diving to his right.

Shami's final victim of the night was Garg with Saha yet again completing another catch behind the stumps.

With half the side back in the dugout, the Capitals, who are at the bottom of the points table and need to win this game to stay alive in the race for the playoffs, were tottering at 28 for five at the end of the Powerplay.

Axar Patel (27), who was promoted up the order, and Aman did stem the rot with some much-needed runs but pacer Mohit Sharma (2/33) broke the 50-run partnership as he snared the wicket of the Delhi vice-captain.

Aman punished Mohit Sharma in the 16th over, hitting a boundary past short third and a flat six over fine leg as DC inched closer to the 100-run mark.

The uncapped Aman brought up a much-needed half century in 41 balls.

His innings was studded with three hits to the fence and as many over it."
"I tried by best but could not capitalise: Hardik Pandya | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz

The Titans skipper scored an unbeaten half-century but couldn't land the finishing punches on Delhi Capitals in a modest chase

Hardik Pandya was unbeaten on 59 off 53 balls.  Gujarat Titans skipper Hardik Pandya took full responsibility for his side's unexpected five-run defeat to Delhi Capitals on Tuesday (May 2) in Ahmedabad. Chasing an under-par total of 130, the Titans' chase was anchored by Hardik who was unusually sedate in his half-century knock and was unable to put the finishing touches as he had expected to.""I tried my best but could not capitalise. It boils down to me,"" Hardik said at the post-match presentation. ""Obviously, we would have taken 129 [131-run target] on any given day. [We] just lost a couple of wickets and at the end, Rahul got us back in the game.""Unlike their usual chasing trend, Gujarat were rocked early in their innings, losing four wickets inside the seven-over mark, including the pivotal ones of Shubman Gill and David Miller. It meant that Hardik, alongside young Abhinav Manohar had to soak in the pressure with a partnership that was more about stabilising the innings than motoring along.Hardik's pacing of his innings was similar to the tempo he had during the afternoon game against Lucknow Super Giants, except that he was able to hit a few maximums at the backend in that game - something that he wasn't able to manage this time around. In fact, the all-rounder couldn't find the fence in the last 13 balls of his innings at a phase when the asking rate had shot up drastically.""We were hoping to get a couple of big overs in the middle but at that point of time we could not get rhythm,"" he said. ""It was new for Abhinav as well. It boils down to how I was not able to finish the game. Full marks to their bowlers as well and full ownership on my side where I could not finish the game I should've.""Prior to this game, the matches in Ahmedabad had produced reasonably high-scoring games that were also chased down successfully. Batters generally enjoyed striking the ball and there were also a lot of boundaries hit in those games. They were a stark contrast to this fixture that saw just nine sixes across the two innings. Hardik, though, didn't feel the surface was all that tricky to bat on.""It was more about the pressure of [losing] wickets,"" he said. ""I don't think the [track] played much role. It was a tad slower than what we are used to here. But they bowled really well. We lost a couple of early wickets and then we had to take some time. We could not get the rhythm in the middle. Rahul brought us back into the game. Otherwise, they were quite ahead.""Since Miller's exit in the seventh over, only one boundary (a six) was hit until the 14th over and it's during this phase that the DC bowlers tightened the screws. Titans' mantra while chasing has always been to take the game deep, relying on the power game of their finishers to get them across the line. Statistically, it had been a largely proven method, except that it didn't work in this contest.""Intent had to be there. It's just that we lost a couple of wickets where if you keep losing wickets, it's difficult to keep the intent as well. We lost because I could not get my rhythm and we kept losing wickets at the start and that put us under pressure. We like to take it deep and hope to get a couple of big overs which we could not get.""The game had been set up nicely for the Titans by their bowlers, led by an impeccable spell from Mohammed Shami. The senior pacer bowled an unchanged new-ball spell that saw him pick up four scalps through accurate lines and sharp seam movement. Hardik was all praise for his pace spearhead and regretted his side's inability to capitalise on the excellent bowling effort.""I feel sorry for [Shami],"" Hardik said. ""If you bowl like that, then you restrict the team to 129 [130], I think [our] batters disappointed. I don't think the ball did a lot. It's just that Mohammed Shami's skillset he has and he made the ball talk. Otherwise, I think for fast bowlers, the wicket did not have much assistance. But the way he bowled four on the trot and got us in the game, full credit [to him].""As I said, batters and particularly myself did not finish and we disappointed him.""The defeat was Gujarat's first of the season in a run chase and only the second time overall from 14 games.

The last placed team in the league took down the table-toppers in another last ball thriller of the Indian T20 League, on Tuesday night. David Warner's  Delhi managed to defend 130 successfully against Gujarat in Ahmedabad and pick up just their third win of the season to stay in contention for a spot in the playoffs.

David Warner won the toss in Ahmedabad and elected to bat first. Mohammed Shami though came to the party- picking a wicket on the first ball, sending back Phil Salt. Next over, David Warner was run out on 1, and then Shami continued his rampage, sending back Rilee Rossouw, Manish Pandey and Priyam Garg to reduce Delhi to 23/5 in 5 overs. A late order fightback though helped Delhi get to a respectable total with Axar Patel scoring 27, Aman Khan making a half century and Ripal Patel adding 23 as the team posted 130/8. Apart from Shami, Mohit Sharma picked two wickets.

An easy chase, you'd think?

You'd be proven wrong because Gujarat too lost some early wickets and were down to 33/4 in 7 overs. Skipper Hardik Pandya though held fort at one end, scoring a half century and got the equation down to 33 needed from 12. Rahul Tewatia hit Anrich Nortje for 3 sixes in the 19th over and 12 were needed off 6. Ishant Sharma though conceded only 6 and Delhi won the match by 5 runs to stay alive in the tournament.

"The Kerala Story controversy: Questioning the number & facts and what's the defence - India Today

The Kerala Story has sparked a massive row. There are two issues at the centre of the controversy. The number of women the movie claims to have been converted and recruited by the terror group IS from Kerala and if the central character is based on a real-life story. Here's what the people on both sides of the debate have to say.

By Adarsh T R: It is a movie that sparked controversy from the word go. And the fire has only spread with time.

The first brush with controversy of The Kerala Story, a movie directed by Sudipto Sen and starring Adah Sharma, was when the teaser was released in November 2022. It claimed that 32,000 women from the state were converted to Islam and recruited by the terror group, Islamic State.

There are two issues at the centre of the outrage. The first is the number of women, 32,000, that the film claims have been converted and recruited by the Islamic State. The second, is the life of the film's central character, Fathima Ba, based on true events or cobbled together from snippets of information available?

The Censor Board issued an 'A' certificate to The Kerala Story and reportedly deleted 10 scenes, one of them an interview with a former Kerala chief minister.

The movie, which is set to be released in cinemas on May 5, is facing a lot of backlash from the Left government and the Congress alike, and leaders are calling for a ban on screening of the film in the state. The Kerala Story sparked a controversy right after its trailer was released, revealing its central plot.

""We want to talk about the issue"" Vipul Amrutlal Shah (writer and producer, The Kerala Story)
""We have not said anything derogatory against Kerala in the film at all"" @adah_sharma, actor
""We are discussing the human tragedy here,"" @sudiptoSENtlm#ITVideo | @sudiptoSENtlm pic.twitter.com/7a79vNCNte
— IndiaToday (@IndiaToday) May 1, 2023
The trailer shows a Hindu girl, Shalini Unnikrishnan, being brainwashed and lured into Islam by her Muslim friends. It details Shalini's religious conversion, wedding, and her being trafficked to Pakistan.

The trailer shows a Hindu girl, Shalini Unnikrishnan, being brainwashed and lured into Islam by her Muslim friends. It details Shalini's religious conversion, wedding, and her being trafficked to Pakistan.

""I am not alone, there are thousands of girls from Kerala who ran away from home,"" Shalini, played by Adah Sharma, says before the trailer ends.

The movie centers around alleged religious indoctrination in Kerala and how Hindu and Christian women are being targeted by radical Islamic clerics. The Kerala Story claims that these women were converted to Islam and later sent to countries like Afghanistan, Yemen and Syria ""to fight for the cause of Islam"".

Political parties, including the ruling CPI(M) and the Congress, in Kerala are opposed to the ""false claim"" the movie promotes. They want a ban on The Kerala Story, which they see as hate propaganda to target Muslims and defame the state.

But the filmmakers have been vocal in their defence of the movie. Actor Adah Sharma, director Sudipto Sen and producer Vipul Shah in an exclusive interview unanimously said the movie ""targets terrorists and not the entire Muslim community"".

INCORRECT NUMBERS, FAKE STORY?

Those opposed to the film have raised serious concerns about the movie's claim to have unearthed the whereabouts of the 32,000 missing women from Kerala. But where did this stunning figure come from?

According to producer Vipul Shah, there is enough evidence of conversion in Kerala and the debate should be centred around how to stop it, instead of focusing on the numbers.

In an exclusive interview with India Today, Vipul Shah said, ""We don't want to get into the debate on the numbers, we want to talk about the issue. We want to bring notice to the human tragedy happening in Kerala and in India.""

Director Sudipto Sen said the discussion on numbers becomes valid only when people have seen the film. The focus of the movie is on human tragedy, he said.

Keeping the row over ""incorrect numbers"" aside for a moment, another question that sparked a debate is whether the life of character Fathima Ba is based on true events or is her story made out of snippets of information available.

""I spoke to some of these women. There will be testimony from those who will be brave enough to come in front of cameras,"" Actor Adah Sharma said, indicating that her character is in fact based on true events.

'PROPAGANDA, NOT OUR KERALA STORY'

Since the filmmakers announced the release date of the movie, the Congress and the CPI(M) have been vocal in their opposition. While the Congress sought a ban on screening of the film, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan called it a ""Sangh Parivar propaganda"" piece.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the trailer of the Hindi film, at first glance, appears to be ""deliberately produced"" with the alleged aim of creating communal polarisation and spreading hate propaganda against the state.

He said that despite the issue of 'love jihad' being rejected by probe agencies, courts and the MHA, it was being raised in connection with Kerala as the main premise of the film only to humiliate the state in front of the world.

""Permission should not be given to screen the film which falsely claims that 32,000 women in Kerala have been converted to Islam and became members of IS. No one should think that Kerala can be divided by spewing the poison of communalism,"" Congress leader VD Satheesan said.

Senior Congress leader and Lok Sabha MP Shashi Tharoor in one line expressed his thoughts about the movie.

In a tweet he said, ""It may be your Kerala story. It is not our Kerala story"".

""Let me stress, I am not calling for a ban on the film. Freedom of expression does not cease to be valuable just because it can be misused. But Keralites have every right to say loud & clear that this is a misrepresentation of our reality,"" Tharoor added.

WHY THE KERALA STORY?

Apart from the plot of the movie, its title 'The Kerala story' is seen as an attempt to malign the state. Producer Vipul Shah said the film revolves around a few people who are involved in conversion, which happens to be in Kerala, and hence the title.

""How is it maligning the state? We all love Kerala. There is nothing against the state in the entire movie,"" Vipul Shah told India Today TV.

'FILM TARGETS TERRORISTS, NOT MUSLIMS'

On another claim that the film targets one particular community, Vipul Shah said if terror has no religion and the movie is on terrorists, why are people saying Muslims are being targeted?

The statement came after the Muslim Youth League, the youth wing of the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), came up with a challenge to the supporters of The Kerala Story. Youth League State General Secretary PK Firos on Monday announced a reward of Rs 1 crore for anyone who could prove the allegations in the film.

ISLAMIC STATE'S RECRUITMENT FROM KERALA

As the debate rages on over the factual basis of the movie and whether its content could be justified by invoking the right of freedom of expression, the BJP came in support of the film and said the recruitment by IS from the southern state couldn't be denied.

""IS has a very strong presence in Kerala. You cannot deny the IS recruitment from the state,"" Kerala BJP chief K Surendran claimed, adding that if the figures cited in the film were the bone of contention, then that could be discussed.

""Films are not always completely based on facts. Treat the movie as one. Watch it first. Why the urgency to stop its screening? Why be scared of it? Why so much agitation? Those who do not want to see it, need not,"" Surendran said.

""The BBC documentary (on the 2002 riots in Gujarat) was shown across Kerala by DYFI after booking halls. Then why block 'The Kerala Story'?"" he asked.

With the release of the movie scheduled for May 5, The Kerala Story is likely to divide opinions on facts , figures and creative expression in the days to come.--- ENDS ---

"Who let the dogs out: Bajrang Dal's warning to Congress leaders coming to their house - India Today

In retaliation to the ban call by Congress, several activists of Bajrang Dal in Chikkamagaluru have put out posters outside their houses warning vote seekers of the grand old party not to step inside or else dogs will be left on them.

By Sagay Raj: Protesting over the Congress's Karnataka election manifesto, which promised a ban on Bajrang Dal if the grand old party comes to power in the southern state, several activists of Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) youth wing on Tuesday put out posters outside their houses with a warning for vote seekers.

Similar posters were seen in several houses in Chickmagaluru district with a Bajrang Dal flag placed atop its building. The poster warned Congress leaders and workers not to enter their houses asking for votes for the May 10 Assembly polls.

The poster read: ""This is Bajrang Dal's activist's house. Any Congressmen should not enter seeking votes. Despite that, if you try to barge in, dogs will be let out.""

The retaliation by Bajrang Dal came after the Congress, in its election manifesto, said it would take decisive action as per law, including imposing a ban on organisations like Bajrang Dal and PFI and alleged that they were promoting enmity among communities.

""We believe that law and the Constitution are sacrosanct and cannot be violated by individuals and organisations like Bajrang Dal, PFI or others promoting enmity or hatred, whether among majority or minority communities. We will take decisive action as per law including imposing a ban on such organisations,"" the grand old party said in its manifesto.

ALSO READ | Congress manifesto for Karnataka Assembly Elections 2023 says it would reject NEP

Hitting out at the Congress, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said that the promise to ban Bajrang Dal in Karnataka if voted to power was an 'insult' to Lord Hanuman and an attempt to 'save' the proscribed Popular Front of India.

Even Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who addressed three rallies, campaigning for the May 10 Assembly polls in Karnataka, hit out at the Congress for promising to ban Bajrang Dal.

""People of Karnataka should never forget Congress's history and thinking. Congress's history is about appeasing terror and terrorists. When the Batla House encounter happened in Delhi, there were tears in the eyes of Congress's top-most leader, hearing about the death of terrorists,"" PM Modi said.--- ENDS ---

"Karnataka Assembly Election 2023: ""Congress Decided To Lock Up Bajrangbali"": PM's Swipe Over Party Manifesto

Prime Minister Narendra Modi today said that the grand old party earlier had a problem with 'Lord Ram' and now it has vowed to lock those who chant ""Jai Bajrang Bali"".

Karnataka Election 2023: Congress and BJP have released their manifestos

In a sharp riposte hours after the Congress released its manifesto for the Karnataka assembly elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today said that the grand old party earlier had a problem with 'Lord Ram' and now it has vowed to lock those who chant ""Jai Bajrang Bali"".

""At a time when I have come to pay my respects in Lord Hanuman's land, the Congress in its manifesto has decided to lock up Bajrang Bali,"" said the Prime Minister while addressing a public meeting in Karnataka's Hospet.

""I pray for the accomplishment of this vow by bowing my head at the feet of Lord Hanuman. We will never let anyone damage the honour and culture of Karnataka,"" PM Modi said.

The Congress has now hit back accusing PM Modi of hurting religious sentiments by equating Lord Hanuman with Bajrang Dal, and demanded an apology from him.

Party spokesperson Pawan Khera said it is shameful that the Prime Minister has drawn such a parallel which is an insult to crores of devotees of Lord Hanuman.

""The Prime Minister is insulting our faith in Lord Hanuman. He should apologise to the country as he has hurt our religious sentiments. No one has given the Prime Minister the right to insult Bajrang Bali,"" he said.

Congress in its manifesto for the May 10 elections, equated the banned outfit Popular Front of India (PFI) with Bajrang Dal, the youth wing of the Sangh-affiliated Vishwa Hindu Parishad, saying it will ban such organisations that promote ""enmity or hatred, whether among majority or minority communities"".

""The Congress Party is committed to take firm and decisive action against individuals and organisations spreading hatred amongst communities on grounds of caste or religion. We believe that law and Constitution is sacrosanct and can not be violated by individuals and organisations like Bajrang Dal, PFI or others promoting enmity or hatred, whether among majority or minority communities,"" the manifesto read.

The Prime Minister also said that BJP's election manifesto has a roadmap to make Karnataka number one State in the country.

Implementation of the Uniform Civil Code, 10 lakh jobs in the manufacturing sector are among the top promises made by the BJP in its manifesto for the state polls.

The party, which faces a tough electoral battle in the state this time, has said that its promises touch every section of the society.

It has said that the Uniform Civil Code will be implemented in the state ""based on the recommendations given by a high-level committee which is to be constituted for the purpose"".

The party has also promised introduction of the National Register of Citizens and ""speedy deportation of all illegal migrants"".

The Janata Dal (Secular), the other party in what is expected to be a three-cornered poll fight, has promised a legislation to provide reservation to Kannadigas in the private sector. It has also said that it will push the central government to hold civil services and defence recruitment exams in Kannada too.

The district coordinator of Bajrang Dal Abhijeet Singh Rajput told Free Press that Congress party’s aim was to take benefit from a particular community and give them nothing in return.

Bhopal (Madhya Pradesh): The activists of Bajrang Dal have taken the matter seriously, in which the Congress party promised to ban the organisation in Karnataka if it formed government. Congress party in its manifesto promised to ban PFI and Bajrang Dal in the state if they formed the government.

The district coordinator of Bajrang Dal Abhijeet Singh Rajput told Free Press that Congress party’s aim was to take benefit from a particular community and give them nothing in return.

“If Congress government bans organisation, we will stage intense protest in the state. The organisation is not new and it is not a political party. We are a social and religious organisation and believe in serving people in need,” he said.

"Wrestler Vinesh Phogat's Charge Amid #MeToo Protest

India's ace wrestler Vinesh Phogat, who has been protesting at Jantar Mantar with other top grapplers against Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief and BJP MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, has said it is tough to stand against a powerful person

India's ace wrestler Vinesh Phogat, who has been protesting at Jantar Mantar with other top grapplers against Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief and BJP MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, has said it is tough to stand against a powerful person who is misusing his power and position for a very long time.

The wrestlers are protesting over sexual harassment charges against the WFI chief and demanding his arrest.

Addressing the media, Olympian Vinesh Phogat said yesterday, ""It is very difficult to stand against a person who is misusing his power and position for so long.""

She revealed that the wrestlers had met an official before they started their protest in Jantar Mantar, for the first time. But, no action was taken.

""Three-four months before we sat at Jantar Mantar, we had met an official, we had told him everything that how women athletes are sexually harassed and mentally tortured when no action was taken, then we sat on Dharna,"" Vinesh added.

Wrestler Bajrang Punia addressed the allegations that they are protesting against new rules introduced for the selection for the Olympics.

""He (Brij Bhusan) is saying that we have made some rules for the Olympics and therefore these athletes are protesting; firstly, this is not about the Olympics, this is against sexual harassment. And if I talk about the Olympics rule; the federation will take trials of athletes coming from the Olympics, whoever they want,"" he said.

Earlier on Saturday, the WFI chief asserted that if he resigns, it would mean that he has accepted the allegations raised by the wrestlers.Responding to the WFI chief's remark, Vinesh Phogat said all they wanted was justice.

Delhi Police on Friday registered two FIRs against WFI president Singh over allegations of sexual harassment and exploitation of female wrestlers.

The BJP MP said 90 per cent of Haryana players stand with him while only one wrestling family continues to protest at Jantar Mantar.

Earlier on April 26, the wrestlers held a candle march at Jantar Mantar, urging Prime Minister Narendra Modi to listen to their 'Mann Ki Baat'.

While talking to the media, wrestler Sakshee Malikkh said, ""We urge PM Modi to listen to our Mann Ki Baat. Even Smriti Irani ji is not listening to us. We are trying to show them the light through this candle march.""

Over the last six days, the wrestlers have slept and trained at the protest site near Jantar Mantar in the national capital.

"Mahavir Phogat opens up on wrestlers' protest: ‘If Aamir Khan tweets…’ | Latest News India - Hindustan Times

Mahavir Phogat has extended support to the wrestlers protesting at Delhi's Jantar Mantar. | Latest News India

Mahavir Phogat, former wrestler and the father of Geeta and Babita Phogat, has extended support to the wrestlers protesting at Delhi's Jantar Mantar and demanded action against the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh over allegations of sexual harassment against him.

Mahavir became a household name after Bollywood star Aamir Khan played his character in his blockbuster film ‘Dangal’. The Dronacharya awardee, however, said he doesn’t expect much from the actors, India Today reported.

“I don’t have expectations from any stars but if he (Aamir Khan) tweets in support, we would like it,” India Today quoted Mahavir as saying.

It is to be noted that Aamir Khan quit Twitter in 2021 to focus more on his work.

His comments came even many on social media questioning the actor's silence over the issue.

Mahavir also claimed that Babita Phogat is also part of this fight.

Three-time Commonwealth Games champion Vinesh Phogat recently attacked her cousin and BJP leader Babita Phogat, a former grappler, who had advised the wrestlers to fight their battle on their own and stay away from sharing the stage with political leaders.

“There was a dharna in January as well. We wanted to inform the sports minister, BJP chief JP Nadda and Union home minister Amit Shah about the situation. They would have resolved the issue. A committee was formed (to probe the charges) but it did not do justice and no report was filed,” Mahavir told the news channel.

“There is no politics over the issue. The allegation that my family is trying to usurp power is false. Our family is together. We won’t take any position in WFI,” he added.

On Saturday, the WFI chief said if he resigned from his post it would mean that he has accepted the allegations which have been raised by the wrestlers.

The Delhi Police on Friday registered two FIRs against Singh over allegations of sexual harassment and exploitation of female wrestlers by him. He also said that 90 per cent of Haryana players stand with him while only one wrestling family continues to protest at Jantar Mantar, New Delhi.

Earlier on April 26, Wrestlers held a candle march at Jantar Mantar urging Prime Minister Narendra Modi to listen to their 'Mann Ki Baat'.

"Salman Khan answers if his blessings are essential if someone is to survive in Bollywood: ‘Main khud settle nahi ho paa raha’ | Entertainment News,The Indian Express

Salman Khan was asked if his blessing is an essential ingredient for an actor to survive in the Hindi film industry.

Salman Khan, who was recently seen in Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan, recently gave a lengthy interview to India TV where the actor opened up about the many controversies that have surrounded him for a large part of his career. During the chat, Aap Ki Adalat host Rajat Sharma asked why, after an actor’s death, Salman is accused of not letting that work in the film industry. While the host did not mention Sushant Singh Rajput’s name, it seemed like he was hinting towards the same.

The host asked, “Kisi aadmi ki maut ho jaaye, toh ilzaam Salman par lagta hai ki Salman ne industry se nikal dia, kaam nahi karne dia, isliye voh gaya (If someone dies, Salman is accused that he has thrown that actor out of the industry, did not allow him to work, that’s why he died.)” To this, Salman just said, “Sir, main khud hi industry se nahi juda hun. (Sir, I am not connected to the industry).”

Salman defended himself that he doesn’t have parties every other day and contrary to other people’s perception, he doesn’t have a lot of friends. But, he added, that he has a lot of friends from his childhood. Salman’s father Salim Khan is a veteran writer who wrote some of the most popular films in the 1970s.

When Rajat asked, “Par impression toh yeh hai ki film industry mein agar kaam karna hai toh Salman ko set kar lo. (The impression is that if you want to settle in the film industry, you should have Salman by your side),” Salman promptly replied, “Sir, main apne aap ko khud nahi set kar pa raha hun (Sir, I have not been able to get myself settled).”

He added that it was after many years of working in the film industry that a filmmaker like Aditya Chopra, who is considered an industry leader by many, offered him a movie. Salman worked under YRF in 2012’s Ek Tha Tiger. The third instalment of the film will release later this year.

He said, “Itne saalo ke baad toh Adi Chopra ne kaam karna shuru kia. Ab Karan Johar ka phone aaya ki ek film hai. (After so many years, Adi Chopra started working with me. Now Karan Johar called saying he has a film). These are the big producers, directors . They also want to work with me, I also want to work with them. This just started 8-10 years ago. Isse pehle koi mujhe touch hi nahi karta tha (Before this, no one would work with me).”

Salman will next be seen in Tiger 3 with Katrina Kaif. The film will also have a special appearance by Shah Rukh Khan."

"After Asking Shehnaaz Gill To ""Move On,"" Salman Khan Explains What He Actually Meant

Salman Khan spoke about his equation with Shehnaaz Gill

Salman Khan with Shehnaaz Gill.

Salman Khan, in a recent interview, finally addressed the rumours about him dating actress Shehnaaz Gill. The speculation started last year when she was spotted kissing the actor on the cheek during his sister Arpita's Eid party. Then, scenes from promotional diaries of their first film together – Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan – fuelled the rumour mills after Salman was heard telling the actress to “move on.” She was reportedly dating late actor Sidharth Shukla but they never made their relationship public. Now, on Aap Ki Adalat, Salman Khan denied being in a relationship with Shehnaaz.

On being asked about his equation with Shehnaaz Gill, Salman Khan said: “I told her to move on. Sid ab iss duniya mein nahi rahe (Sidharth is not in this world anymore). I am sure he will also want Shehnaaz to move on. Just move on, ye nahi ki unki shaadi hojaye, bachche hojaye. Abhi nahi, bohot time hai (that doesn't mean she should get married or have kids. Not now, at least. That can happen later).""

Salman Khan added, “But to get out of that ‘Sidnaaz,' woh bohot hi heavy tha uske upar aur woh toot rahi thi bechari bachchi. Toh maine bola ki 'move on'. Iska ye matlab nahi ki main bring it on, bring it on bol raha (it was a piece of advice for her to get out of the ‘Sidnaaz phase'. It was very difficult for her and she was breaking down. So, I told her to move on. But that doesn't mean am asking her to bring it on, bring it on).” The actor, as well as the audience, then burst into laughter.

Salman Khan has been very supportive of Shehnaaz Gill after the death of Sidharth Shukla. Ahead of the release of their film Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan, at the trailer launch event, Shehnaaz was asked what she felt while working on the film. But before she could answer, Salman said, “Move on kar jao” and she instantly replied, ""Kar gayi."" Their conversation created quite a buzz on social media.

Salman Khan and Shehnaaz Gill's Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan released on Eid last month.

"Rahul Gandhi to MeToo, British-era criminal defamation law is only about power of the elite

The contest seen in courts today is between the 'right to reputation' of the wealthy and 'right to free speech' of a victim or journalist. India should not encourage this unequal battle.

When a magistrate in Surat sentenced Rahul Gandhi to two years’ imprisonment for defaming those with the surname ‘Modi’, it kicked off a political slugfest that is still playing out in the media and in courts. In the resulting political hullabaloo, however, few paused to ask a more fundamental question – even if guilty of defamation, why should a person be imprisoned? Imposing a penalty should be sufficient to settle a dispute between two individuals? Why should taxpayer-funded jail infrastructure, which is already bursting at its seams, be used to host someone who does not pose a physical threat to others?

In a distant past, jail terms for defaming someone – known as ‘criminal defamation’ – had some societal value. In medieval England, public insults would often result in physical brawls, which in turn led to a commotion that threatened the physical safety of local communities. For this reason, Britain introduced laws that punished defamation with up to two years in jail and transplanted it to most of its colonial conquests. In India, criminal defamation became a part of Section 499 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

However, duels of honour are now forgotten memories and jail terms for defamation no longer necessary. Which is why Britain itself abolished the law in 2009. Kenya, with which we share our British colonial heritage, also held criminal defamation as unconstitutional in 2017, saying that the ‘traumatising gamut of arrest, detention, remand and trial’ in a criminal case had the effect of restricting speech and promoting self-censorship. While India is not the only country to have criminal defamation still on the statute, the law takes a particularly draconian form in our country because of the slow pace of the judicial process.

Also read: Rahul Gandhi disqualification poses question. Who owns Constitution: Parliament or courts?

Since the process itself is often the punishment, the powerful have frequently used the threat of criminal defamation to silence critics, especially those they know may not have the appetite for the arduous judicial process. Between 2011 and 2016, for example, the Tamil Nadu government led by AIADMK’s J Jayalalithaa had filed 213 such cases against political opponents and media houses, including those that speculated about her health – a matter of utmost public importance. Similarly, former aviation minister Praful Patel filed a criminal defamation case against author Jitender Bhargava for his book The Descent of Air India, which looked at the NCP leader’s role in the airline’s decline. The publisher subsequently withdrew the book, thus shutting off an important discussion on what ailed our national carrier.

When used like this, criminal defamation has served as a shield that prevents discussions on governments’ actions and policies. It has also been used by India’s powerful elite to silence detractors. For example, former Union Minister MJ Akbar invoked criminal defamation against women who had accused him of sexual misconduct. While a court dropped the charges two years later, the very real possibility of incarceration and litigation costs could prevent many such victims from coming forward in future.

There are other ways in which the powerful further tilt the scales of justice in their favour. They often initiate proceedings in courts that are convenient for them, but which may be thousands of kilometres away for the defendant. The institutional lacunae of the law embolden them further. For example, speaking truth is not an adequate defence in such cases, unless the accused can show that doing so was in ‘public interest’. Similarly, our laws allow public servants, when discharging their public functions, to use the government functionary to fight a criminal defamation case against ordinary citizens.

While courts have often served as a bulwark against unchecked use of criminal defamation, they have also sometimes acted as allies of those with bruised egos. In 2016, for example, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutional validity of criminal defamation and elevated the ‘right to reputation’ to a fundamental right, thus placing it at a similar pedestal as the right to free speech. But the contest we see in courts is between the right to reputation of the wealthy and powerful against the right to free speech of a victim or journalist. A country whose constitution has an underlying egalitarian ethos should not be encouraging this unequal battle.

India today sits at the crossroads of social mobility. Recent economic growth has created a new and aspirational middle class that has the education and exposure to question those in power. India must not perpetuate the power of its old elite by holding on to criminal defamation any longer. Those who feel they have been maligned can always pursue civil defamation, that is, monetary compensation for the reputational harm caused. While the elite of our country have also misused civil defamation laws by demanding exorbitant compensation, courts have usually stepped in to rein in the worst excesses. The most powerful tool in our government’s arsenal – incarceration – must be used for crimes that are most harmful for society. Defamation is simply not one of those.

"Number theory: A SWOT analysis of the Congress in Karnataka | Latest News India - Hindustan Times

Can Congress capture power in Karnataka? Congress has the biggest support base in the state, but its seat share to vote share ratio is the lowest among parties. | Latest News India

Can the Congress capture power in the Karnataka elections scheduled for May 10? Here are three charts that try to answer this question in a strength-weakness-opportunity-threat (SWOT) framework.

Strength: Congress has the biggest support base in the stateAt a time when the Congress is facing a shrinking footprint across the country, it can take some solace from the fact that its support base – measured in terms of vote share – has almost always been higher than its competitors in Karnataka. An HT analysis of the past results shows that Congress has had the highest vote share in all assembly elections held in Karnataka except in 1985 and 1994. It is important to note that this includes the 2004, 2008, and 2018 elections when the Congress did not end up as the single largest party in the state. A comparison with the ruling Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP)’s vote share in assembly elections shows that the latter has never had a higher vote share than the Congress in the state.

While a higher vote share is enough to guarantee power in a proportional voting system, things are different in a first-past-the-post (FPTP) system, where a party’s ability to win elections is contingent on converting its vote share into seat share at the constituency level. Theoretically speaking, it is possible for a party to have a much smaller vote share and end up with a higher seat share if its support base is concentrated in a selected region. A useful metric to measure the ability of the party to convert popular support into seats is the seat share to vote share ratio. A comparison of this number for the past four elections in Karnataka shows that Congress has not fared well on this front except in 2013. This is the biggest weakness of the Congress in the forthcoming elections. The BJP has the highest seat share-vote share ratio during the last four assembly elections, with 2013 as an exception when its seat-vote share ratio was drastically reduced.

Opportunity: Will 75% reservation promise expand the traditional vote bank of the Congress?The Congress’s best performance in Karnataka was achieved on the basis of a social coalition called AHINDA under the leadership of Devraj Urs. AHINDA is a Kannada acronym for Alpasankhyataru or minorities, Hindulidavaru or backward classes, and Dalitaru or Dalits. This alliance was also aimed at othering the two dominant castes in Karnataka’s politics, namely Lingayats and Vokkaligas. While the social groups broadly defined as AHINDA are still the biggest support base of the Congress in the state, its primary opponent, the BJP, has closed the gap as far as non-minority constituents of AHINDA are concerned. With the BJP trying to increase its advantage among the state’s two most important social groups by announcing additional reservations for Lingayats and Vokkaligas at the cost of reservations for Muslims – the decision has been stayed for now – the Congress has tried to counter this by announcing proportionate reservations going up to 75% in the state. If the promise gains political momentum, Congress stands to gain the support of additional social groups without compromising its traditional support base.

Threat: Will a post-poll discord undo Congress’s gains

The Congress has managed to form governments in Punjab, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Karnataka in the post-2014 period. But in almost every state, its organisation has been mired in factional fights between state-level leaders. While tensions have not led to the fall of government so far in Rajasthan (Ashok Gehlot versus Sachin Pilot) and Chhattisgarh (Bhupesh Baghel versus TS Singhdeo), the party has lost a government between elections in Madhya Pradesh after Jyotiraditya Scindia walked out of the Congress in 2020, and elections after it replaced chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh with Charanjit Singh Channi before the 2022 Punjab polls. Even in Karnataka, the party has seen competitive factionalism between former chief minister K Siddaramaiah and its state president DK Shivakumar. Given the fact that the Congress has already seen a major defection of 13 MLAs in 2019, which led to a fall of the Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) alliance government, the possibility of discord within the Congress ranks even if the party were to win a majority cannot be ruled out.

"Karnataka elections 2023: What the political debate ignores | The Indian Express

Congress regimes in 1999 and 2013, and BJP’s intermittent rule since 2008, seem to have shared a common faith in a market and technology-led, predominantly urban growth model. Work and wage-related issues have remained peripheral

The current competitive electoral discourse of parties in Karnataka reveals a certain lack of engagement with what are arguably critical issues in the state’s political economy. Undoubtedly, Karnataka is a fast-growing state, a leader in IT, ITeS and exports, in cutting-edge sectors such as biotechnology, and is an epicentre of tech-driven start-ups.

Despite this impressive post-1990s growth profile, poverty in Karnataka (at 13.2 per cent in 2021), continues to be highest among the southern states (4.89 per cent in Tamil Nadu, 0.71 per cent in Kerala and 12.3 per cent in Andhra Pradesh). Similarly, estimates from 2021 show that Karnataka does not feature in the high HDI list of eight states and in fact, the state’s overall HDI ranking amongst all states is 17th.

To take a single example, Karnataka’s infant mortality rate (IMR) in 2022 was 20 per 1,000 live births, compared to six in Kerala, and 13 in Tamil Nadu. The multidimensional poverty index, which was released by the Niti Aayog in 2021 highlighted that in Karnataka 34 per cent remained nutrition deprived (to Kerala’s 15 per cent, Tamil Nadu’s 24 per cent, and Andhra Pradesh’s 26 per cent).

The continuing north-south divide in the state and the specific pattern of urban development that is taking place provide keys to the contradictions of high growth and high poverty/low HDI. Despite long-standing public concern, poverty continues to exceed 35 per cent in the historically poor northern districts of Chitradurga, Bellary, Koppal, Raichur, Gulbarga, Bagalkot and Bidar. Predominantly rural and lacking irrigation and infrastructural facilities, the northern districts have remained outside of the radar of governments.

Karnataka’s rate of urbanisation, at 38 per cent, has been higher than the national average of 31 per cent ( 2011 census). However, more than 65 per cent of the urban population is concentrated in the three major transport corridors: Bengaluru-Belgaum, Mysuru-Kolar and Mangaluru-Karwar. The urban population of Bengaluru district accounted for 37 per cent of the state’s urban population in the last census (2011). In terms of district-wise urbanisation, Bengaluru district at 88 per cent is way ahead even of relatively urbanised districts, Dharwad at 55 per cent, Dakshina Kannada and Mysuru at 38 per cent and 36 per cent respectively. The window of urban opportunities has thus been confined primarily to Bengaluru.

Expectedly, despite the state’s IT-led urban glitter, agriculture remains the largest employer. In 2019-20, agriculture’s share in GSVA was 12 per cent, but employment was as high as 46 per cent; the share of industry in GSVA and employment was 21 per cent and 19 per cent, while in services it was 66 per cent and 33 per cent respectively. Agriculture provides subsistence livelihoods, particularly in the context of repeated agrarian crises in drought-prone northern Karnataka. This explains the influx of migrants into Bengaluru city.

The total proportion of intra-state migrants in Bengaluru increased from 60.68 per cent in 2001 to 65.64 per cent in 2011; those moving specifically for employment, mainly agricultural labourers or small farmers, remained around 25 per cent over this 10-year period. The insecurities of urban work and income, mainly in construction and low-level services, compel many to retain a dual rural-urban work and home life. Covid-19 only intensified these vulnerabilities and highlighted the inherent weaknesses of this model of urbanisation that is in place.

On the other hand, industrial jobs have increasingly disappeared, caused by the shift to capital-intensive industrialisation brought on by globalisation, international competition in technology and pricing. A declining public sector and small-scale industries sector, and closed textile mills have ceased to be potential destinations for unskilled or semi-skilled job seekers. While the diminishing importance of industry relative to services is an all-India trend, a few of the economically advanced states have managed to retain a higher share of industry in GSVA (Maharashtra at 28.4 and Tamil Nadu at 33 per cent), while at the same time developing their service sectors. Although successive governments in Karnataka have voiced concerns about industry’s low share in GSVA (21 per cent), substantive policies, with a view to raising industrial employment, have not been taken in this regard.

A growing — but small — professional and upwardly mobile middle and upper class employed by IT and related sectors represents Karnataka’s national and global profile. As a spill-over effect, the creation of service-based employment for urban working classes has been much hyped. However, much of the expansion of employment has occurred in the low-value-added bottom rungs of the services sector. Thus we see an emerging class of service providers in transportation, deliveries, security, hospitality, retail and housekeeping. Although service providers may receive a monthly salaried wage, and in some cases, limited social security, the reality of these jobs is that even a minimum wage may not be paid, there is no security of tenure, and hours of work may be erratic and unregulated.

Karnataka’s unemployment rate of 2.7 per cent is lower than the national average of 4.2 per cent. However, the condition of low-skilled workers, even those working in the so-called organised corporate sector, or as contract workers in government service, demonstrates that it is possible to be employed but poor. Whether it is women workers in the ready-made apparels export industry, or as Anganwadi teachers and helpers, or contract pourakarmikas, their long and arduous battles for an increase in salaries and regularisation of services — led by left-leaning trade unions and civil society organisations — have made possible only limited gains.

The Congress regimes elected in 1999 and 2013, the BJP’s intermittent rule since 2008, seem to share a common faith in a market and technology-led, predominantly urban growth model, unchallenged by the Janata Dal’s brief two-year stints in power (2006, 2018). Work and wage-related issues and regional disparities have remained peripheral in these regimes. The pre-election mandates and politics of parties now possibly need to be re-examined in the context of these critical blind spots of political representation.

"Sources: PSG suspend Messi 2 weeks for Saudi trip - ESPN

Paris Saint-Germain have suspended Lionel Messi for two weeks for missing training on Monday to travel to Saudi Arabia, sources have told ESPN.

Welcome to ESPN India Edition

Julien Laurens says Lionel Messi's trip to Saudi Arabia and subsequent suspension by PSG is a result of the club putting an end to their leniency with star players. (1:32)

Paris Saint-Germain have suspended Lionel Messi for two weeks for missing training on Monday to travel to Saudi Arabia, sources told ESPN.

Messi will not train or play with the first team and will not be paid during his suspension.

- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)

First reported by French newspaper L'Equipe, PSG manager Christophe Galtier told his players that they would have two days off, Monday and Tuesday, if they beat Lorient on Sunday, but a defeat would result in the players being called in for training on Monday.

Messi, 35, asked if he would be allowed to travel to the Arab gulf to honour his sponsorship deal as a Saudi ambassador, and Galtier and sporting director Luis Campos gave him the green light to go in the result of a win or draw, but not a defeat.

However, following PSG's humbling 3-1 defeat to Lorient -- their third loss in their past four league games -- Messi flew to Saudi Arabia without asking again for permission, sources told ESPN, meaning he could not attend training on Monday.

Sources told ESPN the situation created tensions within the dressing room, with some players unhappy with the incident.

The situation surrounding the World Cup winner is further complicated by his ongoing negotiations over a contract extension.

Messi's deal at the Parc des Princes is due to expire at the end of the season.

Barcelona are looking into the possibility of re-signing Messi, although LaLiga president Javier Tebas warned that the league won't change its financial fair play rules to allow him to return. He is also subject to interest from Saudi Arabian club Al Hilal and Major League Soccer side Inter Miami."
"Lionel Messi hit with TWO-WEEK suspension by PSG following unsanctioned Saudi Arabia trip | Goal.com India

Lionel Messi has been suspended by PSG for two weeks after making an unsanctioned trip to Saudi Arabia.

Lionel Messi has been suspended by PSG for two weeks after making an unsanctioned trip to Saudi Arabia.

WHAT HAPPENED? Messi has been disciplined by the club, per reports from RMC Sport and L'Equipe. He travelled to Saudi Arabia, apparently without getting prior approval from the club, and will subsequently miss games against Troyes and Ajaccio. He may have even played his last match for PSG, depending on how the dust settles over the coming days.

THE BIGGER PICTURE: Messi's contract with PSG expires at the end of this season, meaning there are only three more games he will be eligible for in Ligue 1. Messi has appeared to flirt with the idea of playing in Saudi Arabia before, sharing a sponsored post from the nation on Instagram last month. He is also an tourist ambassador for the country.

AND WHAT'S MORE: Messi has naturally been a star performer for PSG this season, scoring 15 goals and registering 15 assists in 28 Ligue 1 games. Without him, Christophe Galtier's side will need to continue picking up results if they are to hold off second-placed Marseille, who sit five points behind them with five games to play.

IN THREE PHOTOS:

WHAT NEXT FOR MESSI? He has been heavily linked with a potential return to Barcelona this summer, although it remains to be seen if his former club can actually afford to facilitate a return. He will hope to round off his spell in Paris with the Ligue 1 title."
"Messi suspended for two weeks after trip to Saudi Arabia - L'Equipe - India Today

Lionel Messi has been suspended by PSG for two weeks after making an unsanctioned trip to Saudi Arabia.

By Reuters: Paris St Germain forward Lionel Messi has been suspended for two weeks after an unauthorised trip for two days to Saudi Arabia, French sports daily L'Equipe reported on Tuesday.

The Argentina World Cup winner is banned from playing or training with the team, and his pay will be docked during his suspension, the report added.

Messi will miss the upcoming Ligue 1 matches against Troyes and Ajaccio but might return for the match against Auxerre on May 21.

"""That guy is a fraud"", ""Bad from the first minute"" - Chelsea fans rip into star for 'dreadful' performance in 3-1 loss to Arsenal

Chelsea fans ripped apart Raheem Sterling for his lackluster display during the 3-1 Premier League defeat at Arsenal.

Chelsea fans ripped apart Raheem Sterling for his lackluster display during the 3-1 Premier League defeat at Arsenal. Frank Lampard's team suffered their sixth consecutive defeat across competitions as their free fall continued.

Martin Odegaard scored a brace before Gabriel Jesus made it 3-0 in the first half. While Noni Madueke plled one back, his strike proved to be a mere consolation. Sterling, though, bore the brunt of criticism for his performance. During the 71 minutes he was on the pitch, the Englishman completed only 14 passes. He made no crosses, completed no dribbles and took no shots on target.

Sterling also lost possession 13 times. Overall, it was a lackluster display from the former Liverpool star, so fans lambasted him for his performance. One wrote on Twitter:

Another chimed in:

The Gunners have moved back to the top of the standings courtesy with their first league win in five games. They have 78 points from 34 games and hold a two-point lead over Manchester City, who have two games in hand.

Chelsea, meanwhile, have 39 points from 33 games and slipped to 12th place. Their season keeps getting from bad to worse, and frustrated fans pointed their fingers at Sterling.

Here are some of the best reactions across Twitter after Sterling's performance in the Arsenal-Chelsea game:

Before the start of the season, few could have imagined that Chelsea would be in the position they're in now. They have underperformed massively this term. Ahead of the Arsenal game, Kai Havertz spoke about the club's situation.

The Blues went through a lot this season. Thomas Tuchel was unexpectedly sacked at the start of the campaign. While the new owners spent a massive amount of money to strengthen the team, the performances on the pitch haven't reflected that.

Havertz said about the same (via A Stamford Bridge Too Far):

He added:

Mauricio Pochettino looks set to be appointed the new permanent manager at the start of next season. Whether that brings about a change in the team's fortune remains to be seen, though.

Arsenal piled even more misery on a shambolic Chelsea side on Tuesday as they returned to the top of the Premier League with a 3-1 success at the Emirates Stadium. It was a much needed victory for Mikel Arteta’s side following a run of four games without a win, and they now sit two points clear of Manchester City at the top, though Pep Guardiola’s champions have two games in hand and can return to the summit with victory against West Ham on Wednesday.

For Chelsea, it was another horrendous night. They have now lost all six games they have played under interim boss Frank Lampard and look completely devoid of any ideas or creativity.

Martin Odegaard was the star of the show for Arsenal, scoring twice in the opening half an hour before Gabriel Jesus added a third before the break.

Chelsea did at least improve slightly after the interval as the hosts eased off the gas, and they did pull a goal back through Noni Madueke to give their long-suffering supporters something to cheer.

A dramatic victory to seal the title

Barcelona are closer than ever to their first La Liga title in four years thanks to a dramatic 1-0 win over Osasuna at the Spotify Camp Nou on Tuesday evening thanks to a late winner by Jordi Alba. Barça played against 10 men for the final hour of the match but needed to wait untilt he final five minutes to finally get the victory, which puts them 14 points clear at the top of the table for at least a couple of hours and in essence ends the title race.

Here are the winners and losers from Tuesday’s action.

Jordi Alba: It is fitting that a Barça legend scores the goal that ends the title race for good in a season when he’s seen his playing time severely diminished by the rise of Alejandro Balde, but Alba’s passion for the badge and ability to impact the game in multiple ways hasn’t diminished at all. He continues to be a major threat in attack and while his future is still uncertain, it won’t be a bad thing if he’s back for one more season with the club. His celebration of the game-winner was absolutely glorious, and you can see his love for Barça is still just as strong as it was when he was a little boy growing up in La Masia.

Frenkie De Jong: A fantastic performance from the Dutchman, who probably won’t get as much credit as he deserves for the brilliant assist he gave to Alba’s winner, showing his remarkable poise and creativity even in high-pressure situations. He ran the show all night and made some outrageous passes that constantly found his teammates in great positions, and he deserved to score but unfortunately couldn’t make a great contact on the ball when he had a big chance early in the second half. That goal would have been the cherry on top, but he was still amazing and a big reason why Barça played very well against a parked bus.

Ansu Fati: On the same night that his agent and father met in the Catalan capital to discuss his future, the Prince was given a chance to shine when he replaced the injured Gavi in the first half and played the final 60 minutes of the game. You can see how hungry he is to score, but that eagerness got in the way of the team’s success multiple times when Ansu ignored teammates in much better positions to try and seek glory for himself. That poor decision-making that sometimes borders on selfishness helps explain why he struggles to get consistent minutes on a team that is at his best when it constantly and quickly changes the ball. I don’t want his Barça career to end this summer, but it seems as though we are reaching a point of no return with a player who had the potential to become a club legend three years ago, and a breakup might just be best for all parties involved.

"Barcelona player ratings: Jordi Alba heroics paper over yet another Robert Lewandowski no-show | Goal.com India

Jordi Alba redeemed a poor Barcelona with a late winner to beat 10-man Osasuna

The left-back came off the bench to net an 85th-minute winner for the Blaugrana as they edged ever closer to sealing the Liga title

Jordi Alba grabbed a late goal to salvage an otherwise uninspiring performance from Barcelona, with his bobbled strike meaning Robert Lewandowski's latest no-show will be papered over after the 1-0 win over Osasuna.

Pedri came closest for the Blaugrana in the first half, steering Alejandro Balde's cross wide with half the goal to hit. But Barca were kept otherwise quiet, even after Osasuna lost a man when Jorge Herrando dragged down Pedri as he ran through on goal.

They were equally disappointing after the break. Lewandowski had a series of half-chances, but failed to capitalise on the few pockets of space he was offered by a resolute Osasuna back line. The Pole thought he'd won it late on, but saw his tap in correctly ruled out for offside.

But a winner eventually came, with substitute Alba slicing a shot over the outstretched hand of Aitor Fernandez. It was an awkward strike to cap off a poor showing, with Lewandowski's inconsistency surely of some concern, while Barca's languid play doesn't inspire confidence.

Still, Xavi's league leaders grabbed another three points, and are one game closer to sealing the Liga title for good.

"Karnataka Assembly Election 2023: Siddaramaiah Most Popular Choice For Karnataka Chief Minister: NDTV Survey

Congress leader Siddaramaiah is the most popular choice for the next Karnataka Chief Minister, and incumbent Basavaraj Bommai of the BJP ranks second, reveals ""Public Opinion"", a special NDTV survey.

Siddaramaiah is more popular among older voters, while B Bommai is preferred by younger voters: survey

Congress leader Siddaramaiah is the most popular choice for the next Karnataka Chief Minister, and incumbent Basavaraj Bommai of the BJP ranks second, reveals ""Public Opinion"", a special NDTV survey in partnership with Lokniti-Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS).

The survey seeks to gauge the public mood in Karnataka on a wide range of issues ahead of the May 10 state election and its verdict three days later.

Mr Siddaramaiah, a former chief minister, is slightly more popular among older voters, while Mr Bommai, who is younger, is preferred by younger voters, the poll reveals.

Janata Dal Secular (JDS) leader HD Kumaraswamy is the third most popular chief minister candidate, followed by Congress's DK Shivakumar.

The BJP's BS Yediyurappa, a four-time chief minister who has never completed a term, ranks surprisingly low at number 5.

Mr Yediyurappa, who was Chief Minister until the BJP replaced him with Mr Bommai in 2021 amid corruption allegations, is not contesting the election and has also denied that he is in the running for the top job.

But how important is the chief minister candidate when people vote? Not as much as party or candidate, the NDTV-CSDS survey reveals.

A majority of respondents said they gave more importance to the party (56%) and 38% said they vote for the candidate. Only 4% said they vote according to the chief minister face.

It is voters who support the Congress or JDS who mostly consider party as the biggest factor. BJP voters, however, are divided.

The Congress fares better than the BJP when it comes to voters' perception on key metrics, the survey reveals.

More respondents (59%) saw the BJP as more corrupt than the Congress (35%) and JDS (3%).Unexpectedly for a party that has campaigned nationwide against dynasty politics, the BJP is rated ""more nepotistic"" (59%) than the Congress (30%) and JDS (8%).

The ruling party is also seen to be blighted more by factionalism (55%) than the Congress (30%) and JDS (12%).

In a positive for the Congress, more respondents have ranked it the best for Karnataka's development (47% vs BJP's 37% and JDS' 14%) and for maintaining communal harmony (49% vs BJP's 34% and JDS' 14%).

On handling the Karnataka-Maharashtra border row, the BJP and Congress share equal rating (40%) with the JDS placing third (14%).

The NDTV survey also tried to gauge how different castes and communities are likely to vote.

The Vokkaligas are split between the Congress (34%) and JDS (36%) while the Lingayats remain firmly with the BJP (67%). Muslims (59%) are more inclined to vote for the Congress.

In March, the Karnataka government scrapped the 4% backward class quota for Muslims and diverted it to Lingayats -- traditional supporters of the BJP - and Vokkaliggas. Their quotas have been raised to 7% and 6%.

The survey also assesses the anti-incumbency factor. Disapproval of the BJP government is more among the poor, the lower middle class and rural voters, the data shows.

The NDTV-CSDS survey reveals that the Congress is more popular (50%) with poor voters than the BJP (23%). Among affluent voters, however, the BJP (46%) remains more popular than the Congress (31%).

Voters were also asked to rate the public outreach of various parties. The BJP scores slightly more than the Congress and JDS in reaching out to voters, the survey found.

Rahul Gandhi's Bharat Jodo Yatra drew slightly more attention than the BJP's Vikas Sankalp Yatra and the JDS' Pancharatna Ratha Yatra, according to the 'Public Opinion' survey. However, the BJP and JDS registered more participation in their yatras.

Can the Congress capture power in the Karnataka elections scheduled for May 10? Here are three charts that try to answer this question in a strength-weakness-opportunity-threat (SWOT) framework.

Strength: Congress has the biggest support base in the stateAt a time when the Congress is facing a shrinking footprint across the country, it can take some solace from the fact that its support base – measured in terms of vote share – has almost always been higher than its competitors in Karnataka. An HT analysis of the past results shows that Congress has had the highest vote share in all assembly elections held in Karnataka except in 1985 and 1994. It is important to note that this includes the 2004, 2008, and 2018 elections when the Congress did not end up as the single largest party in the state. A comparison with the ruling Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP)’s vote share in assembly elections shows that the latter has never had a higher vote share than the Congress in the state.

While a higher vote share is enough to guarantee power in a proportional voting system, things are different in a first-past-the-post (FPTP) system, where a party’s ability to win elections is contingent on converting its vote share into seat share at the constituency level. Theoretically speaking, it is possible for a party to have a much smaller vote share and end up with a higher seat share if its support base is concentrated in a selected region. A useful metric to measure the ability of the party to convert popular support into seats is the seat share to vote share ratio. A comparison of this number for the past four elections in Karnataka shows that Congress has not fared well on this front except in 2013. This is the biggest weakness of the Congress in the forthcoming elections. The BJP has the highest seat share-vote share ratio during the last four assembly elections, with 2013 as an exception when its seat-vote share ratio was drastically reduced.

Opportunity: Will 75% reservation promise expand the traditional vote bank of the Congress?The Congress’s best performance in Karnataka was achieved on the basis of a social coalition called AHINDA under the leadership of Devraj Urs. AHINDA is a Kannada acronym for Alpasankhyataru or minorities, Hindulidavaru or backward classes, and Dalitaru or Dalits. This alliance was also aimed at othering the two dominant castes in Karnataka’s politics, namely Lingayats and Vokkaligas. While the social groups broadly defined as AHINDA are still the biggest support base of the Congress in the state, its primary opponent, the BJP, has closed the gap as far as non-minority constituents of AHINDA are concerned. With the BJP trying to increase its advantage among the state’s two most important social groups by announcing additional reservations for Lingayats and Vokkaligas at the cost of reservations for Muslims – the decision has been stayed for now – the Congress has tried to counter this by announcing proportionate reservations going up to 75% in the state. If the promise gains political momentum, Congress stands to gain the support of additional social groups without compromising its traditional support base.

Threat: Will a post-poll discord undo Congress’s gains

The Congress has managed to form governments in Punjab, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Karnataka in the post-2014 period. But in almost every state, its organisation has been mired in factional fights between state-level leaders. While tensions have not led to the fall of government so far in Rajasthan (Ashok Gehlot versus Sachin Pilot) and Chhattisgarh (Bhupesh Baghel versus TS Singhdeo), the party has lost a government between elections in Madhya Pradesh after Jyotiraditya Scindia walked out of the Congress in 2020, and elections after it replaced chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh with Charanjit Singh Channi before the 2022 Punjab polls. Even in Karnataka, the party has seen competitive factionalism between former chief minister K Siddaramaiah and its state president DK Shivakumar. Given the fact that the Congress has already seen a major defection of 13 MLAs in 2019, which led to a fall of the Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) alliance government, the possibility of discord within the Congress ranks even if the party were to win a majority cannot be ruled out.

Even in Karnataka, the party has seen competitive factionalism between former chief minister K Siddaramaiah and its state president DK Shivakumar. Given the fact that the Congress has already seen a major defection of 13 MLAs in 2019, which led to a fall of the Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) alliance government, the possibility of discord within the Congress ranks even if the party were to win a majority cannot be ruled out."

Mumbai, India

Bollywood actress Alia Bhatt made a smashing debut at Met Gala 2023.

Bollywood actress Alia Bhatt, who is often subjected to criticism for allegedly being “favoured"" by filmmaker Karan Johar, is once again facing ire of netizens over her MET gala debut appearance. It all began when designer Prabal Gurung, in a lengthy Instagram post, revealed that he met Alia for the first time at Karan Johar’s 40th birthday party.

“I had heard rave reviews about her through him and my brother Pravesh, who was assisting Karan in her debut film,"" a part of Prabal’s post read. This particular revelation of Prabal has left netizens divided on social media. A Reddit post claiming, “Prabal Gurung’s post on Instagram confirms that KJO is the reason he invited Alia to the Met Gala,"" has gone viral on the internet, with netizens putting forth various opinions.

A post shared by Prabal Gurung (@prabalgurung)

One user wrote, “So they’ve been planning her Met gala debut for 10 years?"" Another one commented, “Thank you Prabal for this enlightening post! No wonder KJo was silent."" However, a section of the internet also supported Alia. “I guess Alia and Prabal have been close for a long time and it was quite evident that he invited her coz they are friends. I remember seeing them together in the picture below when Sid Alia went for their New Years vacation, this is from New York, 2016. She most probably debuted this year coz she wants to grab the attention in West with her Hollywood project, Heart of Stone releasing in 2023.""

In the season finale of Koffee With Karan 7, Karan Johar’s chat show saw Tanmay Bhatt, Danish Sait, Kusha Kapila, and Niharika NM grilling him. They even questioned Karan about his repeated mentions of Alia Bhatt on his chat show. While responding to it, the filmmaker revealed what Alia told him about the same.

Karan said, “I have to be very aware because, honestly, Alia and I had a chat about this. She’s like, ‘Karan, I don’t want to sound ungrateful, but you have to stop talking about me’. I’m like, okay, it has come from the horse’s mouth herself, so I’ve to shut the f*** up about it.""

Alia Bhatt was launched by Karan Johar with his 2012 film Student of the Year. It also starred Varun Dhawan and Sidharth Malhotra. Alia has done multiple films with Karan under his Dharma Productions.

An unseen video of Alia Bhatt from Met Gala 2023 has surfaced on Reddit where the New York paparazzi mistook her for Aishwarya Rai. This was Alia's debut appearance at one of the biggest fashion events in the world. Going by the video, she handled it quite well on the red carpet.

The video features Alia in her dreamy ball gown. She wore an atelier Prabal Gurung ivory silk tulle and satin face organza exaggerated basque waist ball gown with hand-beaded pearls. She entered the event with the designer when some of the paparazzi addressed her as Aishwarya, as heard in the video.

However, Alia paused for the cameras and smiled before Prabal helped her with the dress and she walked off. Reacting to the video, a user wrote in the comments, “They are taking revenge for jhandeya and tommy.” “Ngl if I was mistaken for Aishwarya, I’d be crying of joy. But if I were Aishwarya, I’d be offended,” added another one. Someone also commented, “Paps are same everywhere.”

The incident reminded a section of people about the Nita Mukesh Ambani Cultural Centre gala where Indian paparazzi shouted incorrect names at the Hollywood stars. Videos of the same had gone viral. While some called Tom Holland 'Makdi Man', 'Kya Spiderman banega re tu (how will you become Spiderman)’, others addressed Zendaya as 'Jhandeyaaa' and then said ‘Jijaji sharma gaye (brother-in-law is shy)’ to Priyanka Chopra’s husband Nick Jonas.

Meanwhile, Alia, earlier in the day, had explained the inspirations behind her white gown. She shared, ""I have always been fascinated by the iconic Chanel brides. Season after season, the genius of Karl Lagerfeld shone through in the most innovative and awe-inspiring couture. My look tonight was inspired from this and in particular by supermodel Claudia Schiffer’s 1992 Chanel bridal look. I wanted to do something that felt authentic (hello, pearls!) and proudly made in India. The embroidery, made with a 100,000 pearls is a labour of love by @prabalgurung. I’m so proud to wear you for my first Met."" As per the theme of the gala, she paid homage to Karl Lagerfeld.

Alia will be making her Hollywood debut soon with Netflix's Heart of Stone. It also has Gal Gadot.

"Tewatia inconsolable, Ponting's wild celebration after Ishant's heroic last-over | Cricket - Hindustan Times

Ishant Sharma, who has often been written off as a T20 bowler, held his nerves to dismiss Tewatia and defend 11 runs in the final over to guide DC to a win. | Cricket

Subscribe Now! Get features like

Nick Knight had called it a ""pretty flat and good surface"" with ""180-190"" a winning score. Who would have known that the Ahmedabad track would have shown a different face. Delhi Capitals, at one stage in the game, were left wounded for 23 for 5 before huffing and puffing their way to 130 against Gujarat Titans. It looked like the defending champions had a win sealed for them, but they were wrong as were most, if not all. They incurred a similar start before skipper Hardik Pandya and Abhinav Manohar revived the innings, but failed to up the ante.

Just when Delhi were left certain of a win, Rahul Tewatia did what he does best - smoked three straight sixes off Anirch Nortje. But unlike the usual script for him, he failed to finish it off and there emerged a new hero. Ishant Sharma, who has often been written off as a T20 bowler, held his nerves to dismiss Tewatia and defend 11 runs in the final over to guide DC to an unthinkable win.

Delhi were the firm favourites when Gujarat needed 33 runs off the last 12 balls. The narrative in the match favoured Delhi, but they were up against a team that once chased 12 off 2 and the man who had pulled it off was still in the middle.

Nortje has earned the reputation of a death-overs specialist. In one of the matches for Delhi this season, he showed exemplary bowling with the old ball and nailed pin-point yorkers. The strategy remained the same on Tuesday. Hardik managed only three runs in the first three balls before giving the strike back to Tewatia and that paid off for Gujarat.

The iceman smacked the fourth ball, a low full toss, over deep square leg for the first six, then slammed the yorker over long-on for a second six and in the final delivery, a yorker again, Tewatia shuffled and slogged it over cow corner for a third consecutive maximum.

The Ahmedabad crowd was live once again. There was hope for GT. The equation was down to 12 off 6. But whom did Delhi turn to? An experienced Ishant.

Hardik scored three runs off the first two balls and put Tewatia on strike, but this time it did not pay off well for GT. Ishant finally managed what Nortje failed to do in the previous yorker - a wide yorker - and it was a dot ball. Ishant went wide again, but cleverly dished out a length ball and took the pace off it. Tewatia shuffled across, looked to slam it over mid-off, but got no timing whatsoever and was found by the fielder.

Rashid Khan too has shown his ability to finish off games with sixes off his trademark snake shot, but Ishant denied not more than three runs in the last two balls as DC won by five runs. It was an unthinkable win on many margins, but the target set by them, second their horror of a season so far and third going up against the defending champions and table toppers of the present season. Well, Ricky Ponting's crazy celebrations summed it up for Delhi as he burst out of his seat to hug his teammates while Tewatia was left inconsolable.

""I played enough cricket with him (Tewatia), so was just having fun with him. I knew I had to double bluff him otherwise we know what he can do with the bat,"" Ishant later spilled the beans on his plans for Tewatia in the last over.

"Rahul Gandhi | Hearing of Rahul Gandhi’s plea for stay on conviction in defamation case begins in Gujarat High Court - Telegraph India

The court of Justice Hemant Prachchhak had allowed the lawyer for complainant Purnesh Modi to submit additional documents opposing Gandhi’s criminal revision application against the Surat sessions court order

                                                            File picture

The Gujarat High Court on Tuesday began hearing a plea filed by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi seeking a stay on his conviction in a criminal defamation case over his “Modi surname” remark in which he was sentenced to two years in jail by a Surat court. The decision had led to his disqualification as a Member of Parliament. The court of Justice Hemant Prachchhak had allowed the lawyer for complainant Purnesh Modi to submit additional documents opposing Gandhi’s criminal revision application against the Surat sessions court order rejecting his plea to stay his conviction and kept the matter for hearing on May 2.

During an earlier hearing on April 29, Gandhi’s lawyer had argued that a maximum punishment of two years for a bailable, non-cognisable offence meant he could lose his Lok Sabha seat “permanently and irreversibly”, which was a “very serious additional irreversible consequence to the person and the constituency he represents”.

The alleged offence was non-serious in nature and did not involve moral turpitude, and yet Gandhi’s disqualification, because of not staying his conviction, would affect him as well as the people of his constituency, he had said.

A Surat court had on March 23 sentenced Gandhi, who represented Wayanad parliamentary constituency in Kerala, to two years in jail after convicting him under sections 499 and 500 of the Indian Penal Code for criminal defamation in the case filed by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA Purnesh Modi.

MLA Modi filed a criminal defamation case against Gandhi over his “how come all thieves have Modi as the common surname?” remark made during an election rally at Kolar in Karnataka on April 13, 2019.

On April 3, Gandhi's lawyer approached the sessions court with two applications, one for bail and another for a stay on conviction pending his appeal, along with his main appeal against the lower court’s order sentencing him to two years in jail.

While the court granted Gandhi bail, it rejected his plea for a stay on conviction.

Last Wednesday, Justice Gita Gopi of Gujarat HC recused herself from hearing the case after it was presented before her for an urgent hearing. The matter was then assigned to Justice Prachchhak.

"No Interim Relief For Rahul Gandhi From Gujarat High Court In Defamation Case

In another setback for Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, the Gujarat High Court has refused to grant an interim stay on his conviction in a criminal defamation case over his ""Modi surname"" remark.

Rahul Gandhi was disqualified as a Member of Parliament after the Surat court decision.

In another setback for Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, the Gujarat High Court today refused to grant an interim stay on his conviction in a criminal defamation case over his ""Modi surname"" remark in which he was sentenced to two years in jail by a Surat court. The court will give an order on his petition post summer vacation.

The former Congress president had sought an interim stay of the conviction till the High Court pronounced the order on his petition.

Abhishek Manu Singhvi, the lawyer for Mr Gandhi, cited ""extreme urgency"" to request from the court for an interim or a final order after arguments from both sides in the matter concluded during the day. However, the court of Justice Hemant Prachchhak said no interim protection can be granted at this stage.

Justice Prachchhak said he will pass a final order only after going through the records and proceedings, and posted the matter for verdict after reopening of the High Court post-summer vacation, which will be from May 8 to June 3.

Rahul Gandhi, who represented Wayanad parliament constituency in Kerala, was sentenced to two years in jail after he was convicted on March 23 under sections 499 and 500 of the Indian Penal Code for criminal defamation in the case filed by BJP MLA Purnesh Modi.

The BJP MLA's case against Mr Gandhi was over his ""how come all thieves have Modi as the common surname?"" remark made during an election rally at Kolar in Karnataka on April 13, 2019.

The two-year jail term resulted in him being disqualified as a Member of Parliament. The law states that if a member is convicted of any offence for two or more years, his or her seat will be declared vacant. One can only stay in the parliament if the conviction is suspended.

The senior Congress leader vacated his official residence, which he had since 2005, last month after losing his MP status..

During an earlier hearing on April 29, Mr Gandhi's lawyer had argued that a maximum punishment of two years for a bailable, non-cognisable offence meant he could lose his Lok Sabha seat ""permanently and irreversibly"", which was a ""very serious additional irreversible consequence to the person and the constituency he represents"".

The alleged offence was non-serious in nature and did not involve moral turpitude, and yet Mr Gandhi's disqualification, because of not staying his conviction, would affect him as well as the people of his constituency, he had said.

Last Wednesday, Justice Gita Gopi of the Gujarat High Court recused herself from hearing the case after it was presented before her for an urgent hearing. The matter was then assigned to Justice Prachchhak.

"Rahul Gandhi plea against conviction: LIVE UPDATES from Gujarat High Court

During the previous hearing, the court said that Rahul Gandhi is an elected representative of the people and must, therefore, be cautious while making statements.

The Gujarat High Court is hearing the appeal filed by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi seeking stay on his conviction by a Magistrate court in a criminal defamation case against him [Rahul Gandhi v Purnesh Modi].

Single-judge Justice Hemant Prachchhak is hearing the case.

During the previous hearing, the Court had said that Rahul Gandhi is an elected representative of the people and must, therefore, have been cautious while making statements.

A sessions court in Surat had, on April 20, earlier dismissed Gandhi's plea seeking suspension of his conviction by the Magistrate court.

In a detailed order, the sessions court held that Gandhi's disqualification would not amount to be an irreparable or an irreversible loss to him and refused interim relief to him.

The now disqualified parliamentarian from Wayanad, Kerala was convicted by a Magistrate court in Surat on March 23 for his remark ""all thieves have Modi surname"" which he had made at an election rally in Karnataka's Kolar in 2019.

Gandhi had, in his speech linked Prime Minister Narendra Modi with fugitives like Nirav Modi and Lalit Modi.

He had said,

""Nirav Modi, Lalit Modi, Narendra Modi. How come all the thieves have 'Modi' as a common surname?""

Purnesh Modi, a former BJP Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA), took exception to the said speech claiming that Gandhi humiliated and defamed persons with the Modi surname.

The magistrate court in Surat accepted the contention of Modi that by his speech, Gandhi has intentionally insulted the people with a 'Modi' surname.

In his 168-page judgment, Judge Hadirash Varma said that since Gandhi is a Member of Parliament (MP), whatever he says will have a greater impact. Thus, he should have exercised restraint, the Magistrate ruled.

The sessions judge refused to stay the Magistrate court conviction leading to the present plea before the High Court

"The Kerala Story: Brutal reality of love jihad, weaknesses of Hindu society hit hard enough to trigger a rude awakening

There is no attempt to whitewash the truth or brush the story subtly to hype up the facts like the leftist filmmakers do

The Kerala Story

When the teaser for The Kerala Story was released a few months ago, there was a bitter backlash from both overt and covert Islamist groups. As a result, cases were filed against the film’s producer, Vipul Amrutlal Shah, and its director, Sudipto Sen. Having studied Love Jihad and the trafficking of victim girls and boys to Jihadi battlefields in the Middle East, the story was not unfamiliar to me. I had previously interviewed two Christian clerics from different sects in Kerala more than a year ago. During the interview, they discussed their research and meetings with victim families of Love Jihad and explained the techniques used by Jihadis to ensnare girls. Two years ago, approximately 3,000 Christian girls had disappeared from just one sect of Kerala Christians.

However, reading and talking to people is one thing but watching the same story on screen is very different. It hits you hard. I had the fortune of watching a preview of the film and I came out shaken.

The film opens on the big screen with some stunning visuals of huge arid mountains with snow-capped peaks in the background and a haunting song that stays with you even after you come out of the theatre – ‘Na zameen mili na phalak mila….’ by Sunidhi Chauhan. The cameraman deserves kudos for the beautiful cinematography. He is able to capture the majesty and the arid brutal surroundings of forbidding terrain. Director Sudipto Sen has scouted the unseen areas of Ladakh to create Afghanistan and Syria very skilfully.

The story moves back and forth between the brutal present and the enchanting past. There is no attempt to whitewash the truth or brush the story subtly to hype up the facts like the leftist filmmakers do. Dialogues are simple but effective. The story based on facts and evidence remains true to reality. I am not sharing the storyline of the film as I don’t want to play the spoiler. I can only say that it moves you immensely to see the plight of women who get ensnared into the extremist games and the condition of women in Jihadi-controlled Islamic societies. You feel choked.

Sterling performances of actors, none of whom are big names in Hindi cinema, led by charming Adah Sharma lift up the movie. Malayali-accent and the local Afghan accents are very well captured by the young performers. It is a sad reflection on the stranglehold of the established cinema mafia of Kerala and Mumbai that no established actor had the courage to take up the film despite the supposedly fascist Hindutva regime in Bharat for last nine years! However, the director is able to extract remarkable performances from the entire cast. Unknown faces make the film more realistic as you don’t get distracted by the aura of a star.

A special note of appreciation for the music directors Viresh Sreevalsa and Bishakh Jyoti, who have experimented with different genres of music very effectively. The background music enhances the storytelling. The songs fit in seamlessly and deepen the mood of the events.

The director Sudipto Sen is known more in the festival circuit for his award-winning films and short films. With this film, he has moved out of the festival circuit and jumped into the more forbidding commercial cinema where success is measured only through box office collections. The Kerala Story is a result of years of research. The makers produced a huge amount of written and video evidence to the censor board to convince them that they did not create fiction.

Vipul Amrutlal Shah, known for years for producing successful commercial Bollywood cinema has taken a leap of faith with this movie. He told me that after reading the screenplay for the first time, the only thing he asked Sudipto Sen was whether the story was true. Getting an affirmative answer, he embraced it fully. Perhaps, it was his first exposure to the harsh realities of our society that made him commit totally. He worked on the screenplay and dialogues himself. He has not spared any expense as can be seen from the quality of production. I am sure, many top stars of the industry who were just a phone call away from him will shun him now. And it is not easy to lose friends with whom you have worked for decades,  for standing up for truth. He has put his money where his mouth is. And he deserves full credit for converting years of hard research into a film that disturbs you, depresses you but also shakes you up to face the harsh realities of the world.

It is strange to hear the state’s current Marxist chief minister saying that The Kerala Story is RSS propaganda and has an ulterior agenda. He forgets that his own party’s former chief minister VS Achuthanandan had said in 2010 that organisations like PFI wanted to convert Kerala into a Muslim majority in another 20 years. The film shows a video clip of his statement.

When you come out of the movie, you don’t come out with hate for Muslims. You come out reflecting on the weakness of Hindu society and families who do not educate their children on the basic tenets of Hindu dharma. We leave them vulnerable and confused in a society where there are people whose only agenda is to convert the Kafirs and bring in the rule of Allah, whatever the cost. It is not the writer’s flight of imagination that the only girl in this film who resists and fights back the conversion is a Christian girl. It is not incidental. She understands her faith and also that of the persons trying to influence her. She pays a heavy price.

In the battle of civilisations, if you do not arm your children with the knowledge of the most global and humanist dharma, you will suffer the consequences. Our ancients have told us, “dharma rakshati rakshitah” – dharma protects those who protect dharma. Those who are protesting against the movie are afraid that we will see through the façade of ‘all religions are same’. The sweet poison fed to the Hindus that it is only their duty to be ‘liberal’ and ‘tolerant’ has been swallowed by unsuspecting Hindus and imbibed in their thinking where non knowing about one’s dharma is cool. Well, the things out there are hot and this is what the people resisting the movie don’t want us to know.

Go watch the movie, feel the heat and come back wiser.

Adah Sharma's The Kerala Story expected to enter the Rs 100 crore club by Sunday in the domestic market.

The Kerala Story follows the story of a group of women from Kerala who are converted to Islam and join the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).

'The Kerala Story', starring Adah Sharma, was released in cinemas on May 5. Directed by Sudipto Sen, the film claims women from Kerala were forced to convert to Islam and recruited by the terror group Islamic State (IS)"
"The Kerala Story controversy: Questioning the number & facts and what's the defence - India Today

The Kerala Story has sparked a massive row. There are two issues at the centre of the controversy. The number of women the movie claims to have been converted and recruited by the terror group IS from Kerala and if the central character is based on a real-life story. Here's what the people on both sides of the debate have to say.

By Adarsh T R: It is a movie that sparked controversy from the word go. And the fire has only spread with time.

The first brush with controversy of The Kerala Story, a movie directed by Sudipto Sen and starring Adah Sharma, was when the teaser was released in November 2022. It claimed that 32,000 women from the state were converted to Islam and recruited by the terror group, Islamic State.

There are two issues at the centre of the outrage. The first is the number of women, 32,000, that the film claims have been converted and recruited by the Islamic State. The second, is the life of the film's central character, Fathima Ba, based on true events or cobbled together from snippets of information available?

The Censor Board issued an 'A' certificate to The Kerala Story and reportedly deleted 10 scenes, one of them an interview with a former Kerala chief minister.

The movie, which is set to be released in cinemas on May 5, is facing a lot of backlash from the Left government and the Congress alike, and leaders are calling for a ban on screening of the film in the state. The Kerala Story sparked a controversy right after its trailer was released, revealing its central plot.

The trailer shows a Hindu girl, Shalini Unnikrishnan, being brainwashed and lured into Islam by her Muslim friends. It details Shalini's religious conversion, wedding, and her being trafficked to Pakistan.

The trailer shows a Hindu girl, Shalini Unnikrishnan, being brainwashed and lured into Islam by her Muslim friends. It details Shalini's religious conversion, wedding, and her being trafficked to Pakistan.

""I am not alone, there are thousands of girls from Kerala who ran away from home,"" Shalini, played by Adah Sharma, says before the trailer ends.

The movie centers around alleged religious indoctrination in Kerala and how Hindu and Christian women are being targeted by radical Islamic clerics. The Kerala Story claims that these women were converted to Islam and later sent to countries like Afghanistan, Yemen and Syria ""to fight for the cause of Islam"".

Political parties, including the ruling CPI(M) and the Congress, in Kerala are opposed to the ""false claim"" the movie promotes. They want a ban on The Kerala Story, which they see as hate propaganda to target Muslims and defame the state.

But the filmmakers have been vocal in their defence of the movie. Actor Adah Sharma, director Sudipto Sen and producer Vipul Shah in an exclusive interview unanimously said the movie ""targets terrorists and not the entire Muslim community"".

INCORRECT NUMBERS, FAKE STORY?

Those opposed to the film have raised serious concerns about the movie's claim to have unearthed the whereabouts of the 32,000 missing women from Kerala. But where did this stunning figure come from?

According to producer Vipul Shah, there is enough evidence of conversion in Kerala and the debate should be centred around how to stop it, instead of focusing on the numbers.

In an exclusive interview with India Today, Vipul Shah said, ""We don't want to get into the debate on the numbers, we want to talk about the issue. We want to bring notice to the human tragedy happening in Kerala and in India.""

Director Sudipto Sen said the discussion on numbers becomes valid only when people have seen the film. The focus of the movie is on human tragedy, he said.

Keeping the row over ""incorrect numbers"" aside for a moment, another question that sparked a debate is whether the life of character Fathima Ba is based on true events or is her story made out of snippets of information available.

""I spoke to some of these women. There will be testimony from those who will be brave enough to come in front of cameras,"" Actor Adah Sharma said, indicating that her character is in fact based on true events.

'PROPAGANDA, NOT OUR KERALA STORY'

Since the filmmakers announced the release date of the movie, the Congress and the CPI(M) have been vocal in their opposition. While the Congress sought a ban on screening of the film, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan called it a ""Sangh Parivar propaganda"" piece.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the trailer of the Hindi film, at first glance, appears to be ""deliberately produced"" with the alleged aim of creating communal polarisation and spreading hate propaganda against the state.

He said that despite the issue of 'love jihad' being rejected by probe agencies, courts and the MHA, it was being raised in connection with Kerala as the main premise of the film only to humiliate the state in front of the world.

""Permission should not be given to screen the film which falsely claims that 32,000 women in Kerala have been converted to Islam and became members of IS. No one should think that Kerala can be divided by spewing the poison of communalism,"" Congress leader VD Satheesan said.

Senior Congress leader and Lok Sabha MP Shashi Tharoor in one line expressed his thoughts about the movie.

In a tweet he said, ""It may be your Kerala story. It is not our Kerala story"".

""Let me stress, I am not calling for a ban on the film. Freedom of expression does not cease to be valuable just because it can be misused. But Keralites have every right to say loud & clear that this is a misrepresentation of our reality,"" Tharoor added.

WHY THE KERALA STORY?

Apart from the plot of the movie, its title 'The Kerala story' is seen as an attempt to malign the state. Producer Vipul Shah said the film revolves around a few people who are involved in conversion, which happens to be in Kerala, and hence the title.

""How is it maligning the state? We all love Kerala. There is nothing against the state in the entire movie,"" Vipul Shah told India Today TV.

'FILM TARGETS TERRORISTS, NOT MUSLIMS'

On another claim that the film targets one particular community, Vipul Shah said if terror has no religion and the movie is on terrorists, why are people saying Muslims are being targeted?

The statement came after the Muslim Youth League, the youth wing of the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), came up with a challenge to the supporters of The Kerala Story. Youth League State General Secretary PK Firos on Monday announced a reward of Rs 1 crore for anyone who could prove the allegations in the film.

ISLAMIC STATE'S RECRUITMENT FROM KERALA

As the debate rages on over the factual basis of the movie and whether its content could be justified by invoking the right of freedom of expression, the BJP came in support of the film and said the recruitment by IS from the southern state couldn't be denied.

""IS has a very strong presence in Kerala. You cannot deny the IS recruitment from the state,"" Kerala BJP chief K Surendran claimed, adding that if the figures cited in the film were the bone of contention, then that could be discussed.

""Films are not always completely based on facts. Treat the movie as one. Watch it first. Why the urgency to stop its screening? Why be scared of it? Why so much agitation? Those who do not want to see it, need not,"" Surendran said.

""The BBC documentary (on the 2002 riots in Gujarat) was shown across Kerala by DYFI after booking halls. Then why block 'The Kerala Story'?"" he asked.

With the release of the movie scheduled for May 5, The Kerala Story is likely to divide opinions on facts , figures and creative expression in the days to come.--- ENDS ---

"How accurate are the claims made by ‘The Kerala Story’? | Explained News,The Indian Express

According to the US State Department report titled ‘Country Reports on Terrorism 2020: India’, “There were 66 known Indian-origin fighters affiliated with ISIS, as of November” (2020). 'The Kerala Story' releases on May 5.

Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Sunday (April 30) slammed the makers of ‘The Kerala Story’, saying that at first glance, the film appears to peddle lies aimed at creating communal polarisation and spreading hate propaganda against the state.

Vijayan said that despite the issue of ‘love jihad’ being rejected by probe agencies, courts and the Home Ministry, it was being raised in connection with Kerala only to “humiliate the state in front of the world”.

The film, whose trailer was released last week, is scheduled to open in theatres on May 5. It is directed by Sudipto Sen and produced by Vipul Amrutul Shah. The film stars Adah Sharma, Yogita Bihani, Sonia Balani, and Siddhi Idnani.

Since the trailer dropped, it has been the subject of fierce online debate and criticism, with many claiming that its story is completely fabricated. Others have claimed that it sheds light on the much-ignored story of forced conversions in Kerala.

The film’s plot follows the story of a group of women from Kerala who are converted to Islam (through force or deceit) and go on to join the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).

Adah Sharma plays the character of Fathima Ba – a Hindu Malayali nurse who converted to Islam – and then joined the ISIS, before ending up in an Afghan jail. She identifies as one of the “32,000 girls” (this number, mentioned in the description box of the film’s trailer on YouTube, has now been changed to three) from the Hindu and Christian communities who are allegedly missing from Kerala and have been recruited into the Islamic State after being converted to Islam.

The film claims to be based on real events with its caption saying “Uncovering the truth that was kept hidden”.

However, the film’s claims seem to have little evidence to back them up.

The film’s most controversial claim thus far has been that approximately 32,000 girls have gone ‘missing’ from the southern state, allegedly after being forcefully/deceitfully converted to Islam and then recruited by the Islamic State.

While director Sudipto Sen has claimed that he has evidence for this claim, so far, he has not publicly shared it. In an interview on YouTube channel ‘Festival of Bharat’, Sen claims that in 2010, then chief minister Oommen Chandy tabled a report on the floor of the Kerala Assembly that said “every year approximately 2800-3200 girls were being converted to Islam”. Sen says in the interview, “just calculate this number for ten years and that gives you 32,000 to 33,000 girls” – the number quoted in his film. According to Sen, Chandy denied these figures when Sen questioned him, but he has “the document” to prove his claim.

The Indian Express was unable to locate any 2010 document that mentions the figures quoted by Sen.

Incidentally, Sen was part of the International Film Festival of India (IFFI) jury last year,  whose chairperson Nadav Lapid at the closing ceremony said that The Kashmir Files was a “propaganda” movie. Sen was the first jury member to distance himself from Lapid’s comments.

A bigger claim is that not only did 32,000 girls from Kerala convert to Islam, they also went “missing”, and were allegedly recruited by the Islamic state to serve as jihadi fighters.

The IS has long had India in its sights as part of its so called “Khorasan Caliphate”. The terrorist group first came on the radar of Indian intelligence agencies in 2013, after reports from Syria suggested there were some Indians in the ranks of the IS fighters, who were then making military and territorial gains there.

Since then, several Indians have travelled to Iraq and Syria to fight alongside the IS, and about 100 of them have been arrested by the agencies either on their return from Syria, or while preparing to join the fighters there. Many have also been arrested for preparing to carry out an attack in India after being inspired by the IS.

In 2019, then Minister of State for Home Affairs G Kishan Reddy told Parliament in a written reply that “the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and the state police forces have registered cases against ISIS operatives and sympathisers, and have arrested 155 accused from across the country so far”.

The Indian security establishment has approached the issue of IS influence on Indians with caution. Scores of IS recruits or potential recruits have been counselled, made to go through a deradicalisation programme, and let off with a warning.

The approach is informed by the fact that compared with the size of India’s Muslim population, which is behind only Indonesia’s and Pakistan’s in size, the number of Indian recruits in the IS has been minuscule.

A 2019 report by the Observer Research Foundation said, “India was thought of by analysts to be fertile ground for the recruitment of foreign fighters for the Islamic State (IS). The country, however, has proven such analysts wrong by having only a handful of pro-IS cases so far.”

According to a US State Department report titled ‘Country Reports on Terrorism 2020: India’, “There were 66 known Indian-origin fighters affiliated with ISIS, as of November” (2020).

Within this small number of Indian recruits, however, individuals belonging to southern India make up about 90%, according to intelligence agencies. The ORF report cited above noted that the majority of India’s IS recruits came from Kerala, with the state accounting for “40 of the 180 to 200 cases” across the country. Most recruits from Kerala who joined the IS were either working in the Gulf or had come back from there with an already developed liking for the IS’s extreme ideology.

What about the four girls whose story the film portrays?

The film claims to be based on the story of four women who converted to Islam and travelled with their husbands to Afghanistan to join ISIS between 2016 and 2018. They are currently incarcerated in an Afghan prison.

In December 2019, interviews of four women from Kerala – Nimisha alias Fathima Isa, Merin alias Mirriam, Sonia Sebastian alias Ayisha and Rafaella – were published under the title ‘Khorasan Files: The Journey of Indian Islamic State Widows’ by the website StratNewsGlobal.

The film uses the story of these four women to paint a larger picture of alleged Islamic State recruitment in Kerala."
"Union government’s indifference towards protesting wrestlers is baffling | Deccan Herald

Imagine if Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) head Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh — accused by seven women, including a minor, of sexual harassment — was not a Member of Parliament belonging to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) — how would have the law caught up with him? Would there have been propaganda unleashed against those who have accused him by labelling them

Imagine if Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) head Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh — accused by seven women, including a minor, of sexual harassment — was not a Member of Parliament belonging to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) — how would have the law caught up with him? Would there have been propaganda unleashed against those who have accused him by labelling them ‘anti-government’?

In a cruel sense, Singh is lucky that he belongs to the BJP, because otherwise he might have even been in jail by now. Even a Supreme Court intervention has not prompted the Delhi Police to arrest him.

Instead of feeling ashamed, he is holding press conferences, accusing the Congress and wrestlers of conspiring against him to discredit him.

This is symptomatic of the malaise which has inflicted the police system (and even threatens the judicial system), which, if allowed to continue, can lead to its collapse. It smacks of partisanship of the highest order, and exposes the hypocrisy of a government which gloats about its programme focused on the girl child: Beti Padao, Beti Bachao. This also reflects the fact that some of those who take great pride in the Hindu ethos of very exalted status of women and quote the shloka, ‘yatra naryastu pujyante, ramante tatra devata’ (where women are honoured, divinity blossoms there) are duplicitous in practice.

In case of sexual harassment, the law is explicit that the word of the woman is sufficient to arrest the accused. A sexual harassment charge is criminal in nature, and the wheels of justice should have moved immediately; instead, the government formed a committee led by renowned boxer Mary Kom to probe the allegations. This could have been justified if intent of the government was to get to the bottom of the matter to cleanse the system, and put things in order so that no women athlete would face the same ignominy in future. Unfortunately, the intent was to find a political solution. The strategy did not work, and it is not surprising that the athletes are unhappy with the conduct of the Union government.

The Union government has further exposed itself by not making public the findings of the committee report, which was submitted in first week of April. Babita Phogat, a member of the committee, has alleged that she was not allowed to read the report, and that the report was snatched away from her before she could glance through. If true, this further increases the intentions of the government. If the government was serious about the problem, it should have not only published the report, but also acted by now.

Dissatisfied with the government’s response, the protesting wrestlers knocked on the Supreme Court’s door, where the Delhi Police unashamedly has said that if the court desired an FIR could be lodged the same day itself. It took four months and prodding from the top court for the Delhi Police to file two FIRs, both naming Singh.

It is obvious that the police is not interested in pursuing this case — but what is it that makes it so brazen?

Ideally, the police should have arrested Singh in January itself. But two things worked for him. One, he is a BJP MP who is supposedly very close to a powerful minister in the Union Cabinet. Two, he belongs to the politically-powerful community of the Rajputs. The Rajputs in Uttar Pradesh are very influential, and the BJP does not want to upset the community. Singh himself is a seasoned leader, and can impact electoral fortunes of the BJP in four/five Lok Sabha seats around Gonda district.

A third reason is that the Delhi Police is allegedly a compromised force. Many senior officers in it are either eyeing post-retirement sinecures or are those who toe the government’s ideological line without questioning. These police officers either do not take cognisance of complaints/cases against the ruling alliance, or when it does, it is not in a hurry to do its job.

A few years back when a few masked men and women unleashed violence in front of the TV cameras in JNU and later, when a few were identified as ABVP activists by a TV channel, the Delhi Police did precious little. More than a dozen Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLAs and leaders were arrested on frivolous charges. In most cases the courts were livid about the way the investigation was carried out. Most of them were exonerated by the courts. In the past, the police has not taken notice of the provocative statements made by BJP leaders such as Anurag Thakur, Parvesh Verma, and Kapil Mishra. Serious allegations were levelled against the Delhi Police during the 2020 Delhi riots in which 53 persons lost their lives (two-third of which were Muslims). During the investigations into the riots even lawyers who were helping the Muslim community were intimidated, and their houses were raided.

It is not surprising that the Delhi Police has not taken any action based on the wrestlers’ complaint. What is surprising is its audacity. Despite the apex court’s intervention, it is disinclined to arrest Singh. This is not possible unless the Delhi Police has clear instructions from up the hierarchy. Is it a coincidence that the Delhi Police reports to the Union government and Amit Shah is the Home Minister?

"Wrestler Vinesh Phogat's Charge Amid #MeToo Protest

India's ace wrestler Vinesh Phogat, who has been protesting at Jantar Mantar with other top grapplers against Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief and BJP MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, has said it is tough to stand against a powerful person

India's ace wrestler Vinesh Phogat, who has been protesting at Jantar Mantar with other top grapplers against Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief and BJP MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, has said it is tough to stand against a powerful person who is misusing his power and position for a very long time.

The wrestlers are protesting over sexual harassment charges against the WFI chief and demanding his arrest.

Addressing the media, Olympian Vinesh Phogat said yesterday, ""It is very difficult to stand against a person who is misusing his power and position for so long.""

She revealed that the wrestlers had met an official before they started their protest in Jantar Mantar, for the first time. But, no action was taken.

""Three-four months before we sat at Jantar Mantar, we had met an official, we had told him everything that how women athletes are sexually harassed and mentally tortured when no action was taken, then we sat on Dharna,"" Vinesh added.

Wrestler Bajrang Punia addressed the allegations that they are protesting against new rules introduced for the selection for the Olympics.

""He (Brij Bhusan) is saying that we have made some rules for the Olympics and therefore these athletes are protesting; firstly, this is not about the Olympics, this is against sexual harassment. And if I talk about the Olympics rule; the federation will take trials of athletes coming from the Olympics, whoever they want,"" he said.

Earlier on Saturday, the WFI chief asserted that if he resigns, it would mean that he has accepted the allegations raised by the wrestlers.Responding to the WFI chief's remark, Vinesh Phogat said all they wanted was justice.

Delhi Police on Friday registered two FIRs against WFI president Singh over allegations of sexual harassment and exploitation of female wrestlers.

The BJP MP said 90 per cent of Haryana players stand with him while only one wrestling family continues to protest at Jantar Mantar.

Earlier on April 26, the wrestlers held a candle march at Jantar Mantar, urging Prime Minister Narendra Modi to listen to their 'Mann Ki Baat'.

While talking to the media, wrestler Sakshee Malikkh said, ""We urge PM Modi to listen to our Mann Ki Baat. Even Smriti Irani ji is not listening to us. We are trying to show them the light through this candle march.""

Over the last six days, the wrestlers have slept and trained at the protest site near Jantar Mantar in the national capital.

"Mahavir Phogat opens up on wrestlers' protest: ‘If Aamir Khan tweets…’ | Latest News India - Hindustan Times

Mahavir Phogat has extended support to the wrestlers protesting at Delhi's Jantar Mantar. | Latest News India

Subscribe Now! Get features like

Mahavir Phogat, former wrestler and the father of Geeta and Babita Phogat, has extended support to the wrestlers protesting at Delhi's Jantar Mantar and demanded action against the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh over allegations of sexual harassment against him.

Mahavir became a household name after Bollywood star Aamir Khan played his character in his blockbuster film ‘Dangal’. The Dronacharya awardee, however, said he doesn’t expect much from the actors, India Today reported.

“I don’t have expectations from any stars but if he (Aamir Khan) tweets in support, we would like it,” India Today quoted Mahavir as saying.

It is to be noted that Aamir Khan quit Twitter in 2021 to focus more on his work.

His comments came even many on social media questioning the actor's silence over the issue.

Mahavir also claimed that Babita Phogat is also part of this fight.

Three-time Commonwealth Games champion Vinesh Phogat recently attacked her cousin and BJP leader Babita Phogat, a former grappler, who had advised the wrestlers to fight their battle on their own and stay away from sharing the stage with political leaders.

“There was a dharna in January as well. We wanted to inform the sports minister, BJP chief JP Nadda and Union home minister Amit Shah about the situation. They would have resolved the issue. A committee was formed (to probe the charges) but it did not do justice and no report was filed,” Mahavir told the news channel.

“There is no politics over the issue. The allegation that my family is trying to usurp power is false. Our family is together. We won’t take any position in WFI,” he added.

On Saturday, the WFI chief said if he resigned from his post it would mean that he has accepted the allegations which have been raised by the wrestlers.

The Delhi Police on Friday registered two FIRs against Singh over allegations of sexual harassment and exploitation of female wrestlers by him. He also said that 90 per cent of Haryana players stand with him while only one wrestling family continues to protest at Jantar Mantar, New Delhi.

Earlier on April 26, Wrestlers held a candle march at Jantar Mantar urging Prime Minister Narendra Modi to listen to their 'Mann Ki Baat'.

"Karnataka polls: Last-ditch efforts to woo voters before May 8 deadline - Daijiworld.com



Bengaluru, May 4 (IANS): With less than a week remaining for the May 10 Karnataka Assembly elections, political parties in the state are making last-ditch efforts to woo the voters before the campaigning ends on Monday.

In the final phase of electioneering, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will participate in 20 events, while Union Minister for Home Amit Shah will attend 25. Shah is also expected to hold a series of meetings of party leaders across the state.

Opposition leader Siddaramaiah will head 28 public rallies and D.K.Shivakumar will take part in 19 programmes. Taking lead will be former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy of JD(S) who will be seen in a whopping 50 to 60 events across the state.

Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi are set to take part in 10-15 rallies, public interaction and roadshow campaigns.

BJP has planned a mega roadshow by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Congress is organising a massive roadshow to counter PM Modi's outreach.

Former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy, who has not yet visited his Channapetna and Ramanagar from where his son is contesting, will make it up by hold mega programmes.

Starting Friday, Prime Minister Modi will be camping in the state for the next three days to take up the final round of campaigning.

He will address back to back public rallies in Ballary of north Karnataka, Tumakuru in south on Friday. He will hold four public rallies on Sunday in Badami, Haveri of north Karnataka, Shivamogga and Nanjangud (Mysuru) in south districts.

The Prime Minister will hold a mega roadshow on Saturday. The roadshow will go through 18 Assembly constituencies with the participation of more than 10 lakh people. The roadshow 'Namma Karnataka Yatra' will pass through 36.6 kilometers. between 11 a.m and 10 p.m with breaks.

To counter PM Modi's mega campaign, the Congress has planned a massive roadshow by Rahul Gandhi on May 7. The details are being worked out to match up to the scale of PM Modi's roadshows.

Why PM is so desperate that he is almost here in the state everyday. Is it because, Karnataka as Amit Shah said is the ATM and BJP wants to exploit it fully. 

PM should be concerned about the country and stay in Delhi working for all the people rather than working for BJP candidates. He did this in West Bengal, Himachal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu etc., and the people kicked him out, never to return.

This dual team of Chaiwala and Motu Bhai are visiting Karnataka with the intention of almost settled communal harmony in the state.  The aim of their visit has been to divide people on religious grounds and garner votes.  PM is supposed to take all people along in hi capacity but the reality is opposite to that requirement.

WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THE COVID TIME 
NO BODY AS HELPED US NO ANY POLITICIAN CAME FOR HELP

Just look ,now all of them have time for all rallyee or numerous function within two days .Otherwise they talk  on monkeybaat or radio etc.When Public is suffering they are not to be seen.

BJP has spent over 6000 Cr on campaigns alone 
💃💃💃🌶️🌶️🌶️🫱🫲🤝

Can't Congress win even single elections normally? Even where they seem to find easy win they mess it up. They surely know how to loose 😂

Agreed! When almost all pre-poll  surveys are showing congress in  quite comfortable  position , then who is the person  in congress made such a huge  blunder of bringing in such an unwanted  issue which is  compelling congress go to backfoot. Now it  looks it will be quite difficult for congress to come out off this mess created by them . The issue could have been taken after the election. This is a unique example of self goal because the issue is spreading to other states also.

Our PM  is roaming to get votes from every roads and Gallie , is a shame for all other state leaders.

My friends I feel proud when majority of readers agree with my point of view ! Ther should be justice in the society. People are voting to benefit from the party leaders and not to watch dirty politics and the communal leaders carry on their agenda only with aim of winning the election for personal gain. Not only collect taxes and misuse fund for election canvasing hording black money and promoting terrorism as per their whim and fancies! criminal waste of public money and promoting draconian acts and rules.

Are you coming for voting?

BJP has spent over 6000 Cr on campaigns alone. Waste of tax payers money to promote religious politics

Three desperadoes or Three in one !
At least, Two can challenge One.( 🥴)  Choice is yours.

third class..cheap exhibition of demo crazy by all worthless politicians....we need leader like Che gavara of Cuba...

While seeking revenge, dig three graves,  one each for all !  

When three are 3 in fight, let the fourth take full benefit without fight.

Too many chefs spoil the kitchen.

"Ishant denies Tewatia as DC clinch low-scoring thriller | Cricbuzz.com

Rahul Tewatia dragged Titans back in the penultimate over with a hat-trick of sixes before Ishant Sharma delivered a stunning final over

{{suggest.tag}}

Search for “”

Bottom-placed Delhi Capitals pulled off a surprise win against table-toppers Gujarat Titans in Ahmedabad, first surviving past Mohammed Shami's scything four-wicket haul and then defending it with a collective bowling effort against a side that doesn't lose many while chasing. It was only GT's second loss in 14 run-chases. That the standings don't change even after the result points to the gap between the sides this season but DC were comfortably the better all-round side on the night.

How much damage did Shami cause with the new ball?

GT were once reeling at 23 for 5 after the powerplay. Mohammed Shami was unstoppable with the new ball, bowling his four overs for figures of 4 for 11. If DC were looking for a breather against the new ball, there was none. Shami bowled unchanged from one end, using the little bit of juice in the pitch against David Warner's left-field decision to bat first. He struck with the first ball of the match, beating Phil Salt with an outswinger and getting him caught at cover. The next three wickets of Rilee Rossouw, Manish Pandey and Priyam Garg were all caught behind by Wriddhiman Saha, who had yet another fantastic day behind the stumps.

Aman Hakim Khan takes DC to 130

Apart from those four wickets from Shami, there was a needless David Warner runout in the powerplay. It meant that DC had lost half their side inside six overs and recovery from there looked a long way away. It did arrive in the form of Aman Khan who struck his maiden IPL fifty and helped forge important fifty-run stands with Axar Patel and Ripal Patel. Noor Ahmad and Rashid Khan were tight in the middle overs, bowling their combined eight overs for 1-48, but Aman helped pick 41 runs off Mohit Sharma and Joshua Little from overs 16-18, thus delivering DC to a total worth fighting for.

DC return in kind with the ball

What Shami got out of the pitch, DC bowlers did too. Khaleel Ahmed kickstarted it by getting Saha caught behind in the first over. Anrich Nortje then drew Shubman Gill into playing away from the body and had him caught at cover-point before Ishant bowled Vijay Shankar with a knuckle ball that Dale Steyn called the ""best knuckle ball wicket"" on Twitter. It took Hardik Pandya'a half-century to stabilize the innings but GT had left themselves with too much to do.

Spinners take the game deep

Kuldeep Yadav bowled slow and loopy tonight and got immediate dividend in his first over. David Miller attempted a ramp shot off the third ball he faced and lost his stumps. Kuldeep would finish with 1 for 15, helped by the pressure that Axar Patel built at the other end. In fact, from overs 7 to 15, GT scored only 48 runs and hit just one boundary. That slowdown came back to bite them big time in the last five overs, when timing the old ball on a big ground wasn't the easiest.

Another Rahul Tewatia finish ... nearly

Yeah it was just like we have seen before. He came to the crease with GT behind the eight-ball, struck three consecutive sixes off Anrich Nortje in the penultimate over and reduced the target down to 12 runs off the final over. DC trusted Ishant Sharma with the responsibility and Tewatia didn't quite have another six up his tank on the night. Ishant got him caught on the ring and sealed an upset win for his side.

Brief Scores: Delhi Capitals 130/8 (Aman Khan 51; Shami 4-11) beat Gujarat Titans 125/6 (Pandya 59*; Ishant 2-23, Khaleel 2-24) by 5 runs"
"""Petrol Khatam Ho Chuka Tha"": Mohammed Shami's Hilarious Take On 4-For Against Delhi Capitals | Cricket News

With his impressive performance, Mohammed Shami bagged the Man of the Match award but it wasn't enough to seal the game for the title defenders.

Gujarat Titans (GT) ace bowler Mohammed Shami displayed sensational form with the ball as he picked up 4 wickets giving away only 11 runs in the process against Delhi Capitals (DC). During the mid-innings break when he was asked if he wanted to bowl more, Shami came up with a witty reply. ""Nahi nahi, petrol khatam ho chuka tha (I have given it my all and bowled four on the trot),"" said Shami after becoming the Purple Cap holder.With his impressive performance, Shami bagged the Man of the Match award but it wasn't enough to seal the game for the title defenders.GT had the worst possible start while chasing 131 as they ended up losing three crucial wickets of Wriddhiman Saha, Shubman Gill and Vijay Shankar in the powerplay. Skipper Hardik Pandya tried to pull GT back into the game but it wasn't enough as they kept losing wickets at the other end at regular intervals.""I felt we should have chased this. The mistake was losing wickets at regular intervals, we needed partnerships and they came too late for us. However, plenty of games left. Such things happen,"" Shami said after the match.Chasing 131, Gujarat Titans were dealt with an early blow as Wriddhiman Saha was caught behind off Khaleel who bowled a fantastic wicket maiden. Khaleel beat Saha's outside edge multiple times before finally getting him to edge one to the keeper via terrific swing bowling.AdvertisementHardik Pandya went on the counter-attack in the third over from Khaleel, thumping three fours but GT found themselves two down in the next over as Anrich Nortje had Gill (6 off 7) caught at covers off an uppish drive. Ishant Sharma then produced a beautiful knuckleball to the castle in-form Vijay Shankar and reduce GT to 26/3.GT stuttered to 31/3 at the end of the Powerplay. Kuldeep Yadav came into the attack and didn't take time to strike as he cleaned up David Miller (0 off 3) who shuffled across for a sweep but missed it completely.Pandya and Abhinav Manohar started the rebuilding process but DC kept things largely tight as the required run rate crept over 10 per over with five overs to go. Hardik brought up the 50-run stand with a powerful pull for a four off Nortje. The skipper then brought up his half-century off 44 balls. Kuldeep bowled another excellent over, giving just five to complete an excellent spell of 4-0-15-1.With 37 needed off 18, Khaleel returned and struck with the first ball to remove Manohar (26 off 33), who was caught at long-on. Khaleel completed an excellent over to give away just four as the equation read 33 needed off 12 balls.AdvertisementNortje started off the penultimate over well, nailing his yorkers and giving away just three off the first three balls. But he missed his marker as Rahul Tewatia came into his own to swing the next three balls for three sixes in a row to bring the equation down to 12 needed off the last over.Warner handed the ball to Ishant for the final over and the experienced veteran answered his captain's call with a fantastic over.Ishant started off brilliantly and gave away just three off the first three balls and then got Tewatia (20 off 7), caught at extra cover as the equation came to 9 needed of 2 balls. Rashid Khan smashed the next one to cover the point where Rossouw stopped it.Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.comWith 7 needed off the last ball, Ishant bowled a full toss which Rashid sliced over backward point for just two as the DC players erupted in wild celebrations.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)Comments Topics mentioned in this article Gujarat Titans  Delhi Capitals  Mohammad Shami IPL 2023 CricketGet the latest updates on IPL 2023 and check out  IPL Schedule and Live Cricket Score. Like us on Facebook or follow us on Twitter for more sports updates.

"DC's Aman makes most of opportunity - Rediff Cricket

The 26-year-old revealed he was not slated to play but was drafted into the side as Mitchell Marsh was ill.

Delhi Capitals all-rounder Aman Khan on Tuesday commended his side for producing a collective effort to stun table-toppers Gujarat Titans in a low-scoring IPL clash in Ahmedabad, with his maiden fifty setting up the tense five-run win.

Delhi Capitals were tottering at 23 for five when Aman came in at No 7 and rescued his side with a 44-ball 51, studded with three sixes and as many fours.

His knock and a couple of partnerships -- 50 runs with Axar Patel (27) for the sixth wicket and 53 runs for the seventh wicket with Ripal Patel (23) -- pushed Delhi's total to 130 for eight.

In reply, defending champions Gujarat Titans could only make 125 for six despite an unbeaten 59 from Hardik Pandya and late heroics from Rahul Tewatia (20 off 7 balls, 3x6s).

""Gujarat Titans is on top of the table, they are high on confidence so our bowlers also had to bowl really well to defend that total,"" Aman told the media after Delhi secured a thrilling five-run victory.

""It is a collective effort but the last over that Ishant Sharma bowled he looked very confident and a lot of credit goes to him for winning this match. The way Rahul Tewatia and Hardik Pandya were batting and you know what Rashid Khan can do; I feel it was a collective effort.""

Talking about his innings, Aman said: ""Obviously it is (his knock) satisfying because we won, otherwise it would not have been satisfying. Having some runs behind me now, I can go into the next game with more confidence.

""The last month has been difficult because games have not gone our way. We have lost a couple of close games and I don't know how the qualification looks like but we are looking to win all games from here.""

The 26-year-old revealed he was not slated to play but was drafted into the side as Mitchell Marsh was ill.

""The situations I was going into bat, (we had) 30 balls and 100 required so I was not thinking much or was low on confidence. But in the previous game I played in Hyderabad against (Sunrisers) Hyderabad, I threw my wicket and was really disappointed.

""I was thinking if I would get another opportunity. In fact, today I was not going to play. Mitchell Marsh got sick and I came into the side.""

Aman said Axar Patel's advice in the middle also guided him well.

""I was just looking to react to the ball and put the loose balls away. Axar kept telling me that if we keep batting then we can get to a fighting total,"" he was quoted as saying by the franchise."
"I tried my best but could not capitalise: Hardik Pandya | Cricbuzz.com

The Titans skipper scored an unbeaten half-century but couldn't land the finishing punches on Delhi Capitals in a modest chase

{{suggest.tag}}

Gujarat Titans skipper Hardik Pandya took full responsibility for his side's unexpected five-run defeat to Delhi Capitals on Tuesday (May 2) in Ahmedabad. Chasing an under-par total of 130, the Titans' chase was anchored by Hardik who was unusually sedate in his half-century knock and was unable to put the finishing touches as he had expected to.

""I tried my best but could not capitalise. It boils down to me,"" Hardik said at the post-match presentation. ""Obviously, we would have taken 129 [131-run target] on any given day. [We] just lost a couple of wickets and at the end, Rahul got us back in the game.""

Unlike their usual chasing trend, Gujarat were rocked early in their innings, losing four wickets inside the seven-over mark, including the pivotal ones of Shubman Gill and David Miller. It meant that Hardik, alongside young Abhinav Manohar had to soak in the pressure with a partnership that was more about stabilising the innings than motoring along.

Hardik's pacing of his innings was similar to the tempo he had during the afternoon game against Lucknow Super Giants, except that he was able to hit a few maximums at the backend in that game - something that he wasn't able to manage this time around. In fact, the all-rounder couldn't find the fence in the last 13 balls of his innings at a phase when the asking rate had shot up drastically.

""We were hoping to get a couple of big overs in the middle but at that point of time we could not get rhythm,"" he said. ""It was new for Abhinav as well. It boils down to how I was not able to finish the game. Full marks to their bowlers as well and full ownership on my side where I could not finish the game I should've.""

Prior to this game, the matches in Ahmedabad had produced reasonably high-scoring games that were also chased down successfully. Batters generally enjoyed striking the ball and there were also a lot of boundaries hit in those games. They were a stark contrast to this fixture that saw just nine sixes across the two innings. Hardik, though, didn't feel the surface was all that tricky to bat on.

""It was more about the pressure of [losing] wickets,"" he said. ""I don't think the [track] played much role. It was a tad slower than what we are used to here. But they bowled really well. We lost a couple of early wickets and then we had to take some time. We could not get the rhythm in the middle. Rahul brought us back into the game. Otherwise, they were quite ahead.""

Since Miller's exit in the seventh over, only one boundary (a six) was hit until the 14th over and it's during this phase that the DC bowlers tightened the screws. Titans' mantra while chasing has always been to take the game deep, relying on the power game of their finishers to get them across the line. Statistically, it had been a largely proven method, except that it didn't work in this contest.

""Intent had to be there. It's just that we lost a couple of wickets where if you keep losing wickets, it's difficult to keep the intent as well. We lost because I could not get my rhythm and we kept losing wickets at the start and that put us under pressure. We like to take it deep and hope to get a couple of big overs which we could not get.""

The game had been set up nicely for the Titans by their bowlers, led by an impeccable spell from Mohammed Shami. The senior pacer bowled an unchanged new-ball spell that saw him pick up four scalps through accurate lines and sharp seam movement. Hardik was all praise for his pace spearhead and regretted his side's inability to capitalise on the excellent bowling effort.

""I feel sorry for [Shami],"" Hardik said. ""If you bowl like that, then you restrict the team to 129 [130], I think [our] batters disappointed. I don't think the ball did a lot. It's just that Mohammed Shami's skillset he has and he made the ball talk. Otherwise, I think for fast bowlers, the wicket did not have much assistance. But the way he bowled four on the trot and got us in the game, full credit [to him].

""As I said, batters and particularly myself did not finish and we disappointed him.""

The defeat was Gujarat's first of the season in a run chase and only the second time overall from 14 games. The defending champions next go to Jaipur to take on the Rajasthan Royals on Friday (May 5)."
"Sena (UBT) says Sharad Pawar's criticism of Uddhav his 'personal opinion', but leaders defend party chief

In his updated autobiography 'Lok Maze Sangati', NCP supremo Sharad Pawar claimed that Uddhav lacked political acumen and gave up the Maharashtra CM's chair without putting up a fight.

Mumbai: As details of Sharad Pawar’s criticism of Uddhav Thackeray in his updated autobiography emerged, the Shiv Sena (UBT) maintained that it was the NCP supremo’s personal opinion and will have no impact on the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance.

“Whatever was written about Uddhav Thackeray by Sharad Pawar might be his personal opinion. Very soon Uddhav Thackeray will be giving an interview in (Sena mouthpiece) Saamana and he will answer all questions regarding the same,” Shiv Sena (UBT) leader and MP Sanjay Raut told mediapersons Wednesday.

However, Pawar’s words haven’t gone down well with Sena (UBT) functionaries. Kishori Pednekar, former Mumbai mayor, defended her party chief. “We are too small to comment on what Pawar has to say. He has more knowledge but I don’t think what he said is right,” she told ThePrint.

In his updated autobiography Lok Maze Sangati (People, My Companion), Sharad Pawar — who announced his decision to step down as NCP chief at the book’s release Tuesday — claimed that Uddhav lacked political acumen and did not put up a fight when the Eknath Shinde camp of MLAs rebelled and stepped down from the CM’s post.

The NCP leader further wrote in his book that Uddhav wasn’t as accessible as his father, former Shiv Sena supremo Bal Thackeray. “The ease with which we used to interact with Balasaheb was lacking with Uddhav. I would visit him considering his health and doctor’s appointments. I feel the reason Uddhav took a step back just before the fall of the MVA government was his health,” he wrote.

The Congress, the NCP, and the (then undivided) Shiv Sena had formed the MVA in 2019. Last year, a rebellion by a faction of Sena leaders, led by current Maharashtra chief minister Eknath Shinde, led to the collapse of the MVA government. The Shinde faction then formed the government with support from the BJP, and has since been allotted the Shiv Sena party name by the Election Commission.

Speaking to ThePrint, a Sena (UBT) leader, not wanting to be named, said the party has decided to not speak on Pawar’s comments for now.

“They (NCP) currently have their own internal problems to solve. At this time, we don’t want to add anything more to double their problems…Although what he said is his personal opinion, not necessarily his party’s opinion. I don’t want to say more,” the leader said, possibly referring to Sharad Pawar’s decision to step down as NCP chief in the backdrop of speculation over his nephew Ajit Pawar’s alleged overtures to the BJP.

Former Mumbai mayor Pednekar, quoted earlier, said that while he was CM, Uddhav Thackeray was not going to Mantralaya regularly because of his health issues. “Uddhav Thackeray had his reasons. Why would anyone who was on such a high post not go to Mantralaya? For us, we know what Uddhav ji is and what he did was because of his health.”

The Sena (UBT) leader mentioned earlier said that Uddhav had been accepted by the masses. “If his tenure was that objectionable, would he have been voted as one of the top CMs in the country? His work during Covid is also applauded. How is he a failure?” the leader asked.

"Sharad Pawar resignation: Who Will Succeed Sharad Pawar? Meet Tomorrow To Pick New Chief: Sources

Sharad Pawar's Resignation has been seen by many as a calculated step to outflank an attempted coup.

Sharad Pawar resigns as NCP chief, leaving supporters stunned.

The big succession question after veteran political leader Sharad Pawar's stunning resignation as chief of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) two days ago could be answered tomorrow following a meeting in Mumbai, party sources said on Thursday.

A committee, appointed by Mr Pawar to pick his successor after his resignation, will meet at 11 am at the party office in Mumbai, NCP sources said. If Mr Pawar remains firm on his decision, his daughter Supriya Sule is likely to become party chief, they said.

Announced in the wake of moves by his nephew Ajit Pawar supposedly to split the party and take over as chief, Sharad Pawar's resignation has been seen by many as a calculated step to outflank an attempted coup.

The anointment of Ms Sule, a member of parliament from her father's home constituency in Maharashtra, would ensure the wily 82-year-old keeps the keys to the door.

Mr Pawar, who has betrayed little of his impassive self in the two days since, emerged from his home on Thursday and met supporters picketing his front door, asking him to take back his resignation.

""You are right that before taking such a decision, it should have been discussed with members. But I knew that you people would never agree, so I took a direct decision. The committee will sit and discuss it. After next one or two days, you people will not have to do protest like this,"" he said.

Spelling out the name around which Mr Pawar's loyalists seem to be coalescing, senior party leader Chaggan Bhujbal, told NDTV on Wednesday, ""Ajit Pawar should take care of the state and (Supriya) Sule should take care of national politics. She should be the next national president if Sharad Pawar doesn't want to continue as the president.""

Clearing the road for her on Thursday was the party's Maharashtra unit chief, Jayant Patil, who said he has no desire to become the national president. The avowal echoed one by his colleague, Praful Patel, a day ago.

Taking his name out of contention, Mr Patel on Wednesday had said Mr Pawar has not relented, despite repeated appeals from leaders and supporters that he withdraw his decision to step down.

He said there was no question of picking Sharad Pawar's successor as party chief until there was a final decision on his announcement to quit the post.

""Pawar yesterday said there should be a generational change. Maybe he wanted a new generation to step forward. None of us knew about it beforehand. He has asked for some time, and we should grant him that,"" Mr Patel said.

""He sought time to think over his decision after the party asked him to reconsider it, and until the final decision is arrived at, there is no question of deliberating on his successor,"" he said.

The party was trying to persuade Mr Pawar to reconsider his decision, Mr Patel said, adding that workers should have patience and stop resigning from their posts en masse in protest against the decision.

At least two MLAs and several office-bearers have offered to resign after Mr Pawar's announcement.

"Sharad Pawar’s resignation: Chanakya triumphs again

Jyoti Punwani writes: By resigning as NCP chief, Sharad Pawar has stolen a march over nephew Ajit Pawar, and consolidated support of his party workers

It didn’t take long for the rethink on the resignation. Allowing the hysteria to last just a few hours seemed more in keeping with Sharad Pawar’s style than his dramatic announcement on Tuesday evening that he was resigning from the presidentship of the party he had founded and which is identified with him. One didn’t think the NCP chief, whose pronouncements are known more for their practicality than their emotional appeal, was the kind who’d encourage the anarchistic melodrama that invariably follows such announcements. Old timers would recall the tearful scenes at Janata Party leader and Karnataka CM Ramakrishna Hegde’s many resignations in the ’80s. Shiv Sena supremo Bal Thackeray indulged in this gimmick twice, but then, he always encouraged the cult that grew around him. Sonia Gandhi too, offered her resignation in 1999; ironically, Pawar was the main reason for this. She stayed on — Pawar was expelled and founded the NCP.

The Congress has never let go of the Gandhi family since Sonia became president in 1998. In the same way, it seems unlikely that the NCP will ever let go of Sharad Pawar.

Surely the 83-year-old, known to be the shrewdest politician around, knows this. Did nephew Ajit Pawar finally drive him to the end of his tether?

Pawar is not known as Chanakya for nothing. One doesn’t know whether he has himself scripted the crises that have recently overwhelmed his party, first in 2019 when Ajit Pawar was sworn in as deputy CM of Maharashtra with the BJP’s Devendra Fadnavis as CM, and now with the former announcing his desire to be CM right away, despite being in the Opposition. At the heart of both crises lies a lurking BJP with its own Chanakya. It failed in its long standing desire to break the senior most strongman of Maharashtra in its first attempt during the 2019 Maharashtra Assembly polls. Pawar simply twisted the BJP’s trusted weapon – an ED summons – in his own favour. It was once again outwitted by Pawar after the polls, when it was all set to cut its oldest ally to size. Far from succeeding in downsizing Uddhav Thackeray’s Shiv Sena, the BJP found itself out of power despite having won the most seats. Its success in wooing Ajit Pawar could last just four days; but those were enough for the latter to get the “BJP whitewash’’ that all scam-accused defectors get. On the fifth day, the truant leader, now cleared by the Anti-Corruption Bureau, was welcomed back into the NCP fold, and a month later, rewarded with the Deputy CM’s post.

Pawar’s masterstroke of bringing to fruition the MVA alliance is yet to be avenged by the BJP. The split engineered in the Shiv Sena last year did bring down the MVA coalition government, but it left Thackeray bleeding, not Pawar. Had the BJP’s recent overtures to the more-than-willing Ajit succeeded, that would have delivered a grievous wound to Sharad Pawar.

But the party chief had already started dealing with this possibility in his own style. When rumours were rife about a number of NCP MLAs going over to the BJP’s side under Ajit Pawar’s leadership, Pawar made the seemingly nonchalant remark that those who didn’t have the stomach to face an ED/CBI summons were free to leave. One would have had to be an extraordinarily thick-skinned politician to leave after this comment.

But even these preliminary moves between the BJP and Ajit Pawar served a purpose — they shook the already unequal Eknath Shinde-Devendra Fadnavis relationship on which the state government depends, and also deepened Fadnavis’ unhappiness at having been deprived of the CM’s post in a government he helped form. For, Ajit Pawar, after having been deputy CM four times already, wouldn’t have settled for any post other than that of CM, as he himself made clear.

All this worked in favour of not just Sharad Pawar, but also the MVA, and Uddhav Thackeray in particular, who after finally bestirring himself to leave his home and tour the state, finds the effort to have been worth it. Responses to his rallies signal a promising outcome for next year’s polls for the MVA.

With the right messages having been sent all round, including to restive NCP MLAs, it was time to put the nephew in his place. It is significant that only Ajit Pawar accepted the NCP chief’s resignation without demur. How was he to know that he, who was dreaming of finally becoming CM or at least party president, would end up as just one of 15 committee members tasked with finding his uncle’s successor?

Chanakya triumphs once again.

"Rs 2,000 for Women Sop May Have Seen it Home in K'taka, But Cong Just Had To Do the 'Bajrang Dal' Own Goal

Bajrang Dal controversy: Its promise of Rs 2,000 for every woman in Karnataka seems to be resonating across the state. But with the ‘Bajrang Dal’ googly, the Congress is handing over another issue on the platter to the BJP in Karnataka elections 2023

Written By:  Aman Sharma

Bengaluru, India

Is this a case of the national leadership of the Congress prevailing over the view of its state leadership and will the party pay the price for this on May 10? We will know on May 13. (PTI/File)

“Jai Bajrangbali” — thundered the Prime Minister in all his election rallies in Karnataka on Wednesday, expectedly cashing in on the Congress’s announcement in its manifesto that it will ban Right-wing outfit Bajrang Dal if it comes to power in the state.

In the last lap of the campaign, when its promise of Rs 2,000 for every woman in Karnataka is the one that seems to be resonating across the state, trust the Congress to inexplicably come up with the ‘Bajrang Dal’ googly in its manifesto, handing over another issue on the platter to the BJP. The ruling party’s leaders, led by the PM, have pounced on the opportunity and made it the theme of the last week campaign in the crucial state.

Organisations are banned on hard evidence that needs to stand up to legal scrutiny of tribunals. Recently, when the Centre banned the Popular Front of India (PFI) under the UAPA, it cited how multiple states had recommended the ban and, through a notification, cited the cases of violence they were involved in. Subsequently, a tribunal upheld the ban. In short, banning an organisation is a legal process, not a political one.

In Karnataka, the issue of the Congress clubbing the Bajrang Dal with the PFI may further unite the already-aligned Muslim voter with the party but has the potential to offend some of the Hindu electorate which otherwise may have been aligned with the Congress on caste lines. It further gives an opportunity to the BJP in the all-crucial last week to unite the caste-driven voters on the issue of Hindutva and keep its poll fortress of coastal Karnataka intact.

The Congress, so far, in Karnataka had kept its campaign ‘local’ on the issue of ’40% corruption’ and its ‘five guarantees’. Its state leaders have been stressing enough on the same to avoid a confrontation with the Modi-led BJP on national issues. The party has feedback that its promise of Rs 2,000 per month to every woman and Rs 3,000 per month to every unemployed graduate is the one resonating the most in the state as every family stands to gain Rs 5,000 a month if it has a graduate in addition to a woman.

However, first the “Modi is like a poisonous snake” remark by Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, and now the ‘Bajrang Dal’ ban promise in the manifesto, take the spotlight away from what’s working for the Congress on the ground in the state. It has also given the BJP the platform to make the election around PM Modi and Hindutva.

"Veerappa Moily On Bajrang Dal Row: Congress Leader Says Karnataka Manifesto Has No Proposal To Ban It

The Congress's Karnataka election manifesto had said that the party was committed to acting against organisations like the Bajrang Dal and Popular Front of India (PFI).

Veerappa Moily said the Bajrang Dal cannot be banned by a state government.

A senior leader of the Congress party, which had promised to crack down on radical groups in hopes of winning next week's Karnataka election, said on Thursday that there was no proposal to ban the Bajrang Dal, the youth wing of the Sangh-affiliated Vishwa Hindu Parishad.

Veerappa Moily, a former chief minister of Karnataka and a member of parliament, made the statement in Udupi, two days after the party's announcement in the May 10 election manifesto triggered a backlash from members of the ruling BJP, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

""We have mentioned both the PFI and the Bajrang Dal in our manifesto. This includes all (radical) outfits. Banning an outfit is not possible by a state government. The Bajrang Dal cannot be banned by the Karnataka government,"" he said.

""DK Shivakumar will give more clarity... Even the Supreme Court has given judgement to stop hate politics. We have no proposal to ban the Bajrang Dal. I can tell you this as a leader,"" Mr Moily, also a former Union Minister, added.

The clarification came as the BJP organised a demonstration against the manifesto, with former Karnataka minister and senior BJP leader KS Eshwarappa setting fire to the document in Kalaburgi.

""Bajrang Dal is a patriotic organisation. This is an attempt by the Congress to support the PFI, an outfit that was banned by the centre under the anti-terror law,"" he said.

The manifesto had said that the Congress party was committed to taking ""firm and decisive action"" against individuals and organizations spreading ""enmity or hatred, whether among majority or minority communities.""

It had named the Popular Front of India (PFI), a Muslim group banned by some states for alleged links to terrorism, and the Bajrang Dal, which is often linked with vigilantism, violence and moral policing.

The inclusion of the Bajrang Dal in the manifesto had drawn sharp criticism from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who accused the Congress of insulting Lord Hanuman, a Hindu deity revered by the group.

He also said that the Congress had a problem with Lord Ram, another Hindu god whose temple the BJP wants to build at a disputed site in Ayodhya.

Hitting back, the Congress accused the Prime Minister of ""hurting religious sentiments"" of devotees by equating Lord Hanuman with the Bajrang Dal and demanded an apology from him.

Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said it is shameful that the prime minister has drawn such a parallel, which is an insult to crores of devotees of Lord Hanuman.

Anything Deepika Padukone does is bound to make headlines. After all, she is one of the biggest superstars in the country today. So, when Deepika Padukone chose to change her Instagram display picture (DP), needless to say, it caught the attention of her fans on social media. The Ram Leela star changed her display image from a picture of herself to that of a clear, blue sky, clicked by the actress herself. In addition to changing her DP, Deepika also shared the two photos on the Instagram timeline and asked her fans: “Anyone else obsessed with taking pictures of cloud formations? #nofilter.”

In response to her caption, several fans only had one query – why change the DP? For instance, one fan wrote, “Oh god what is this behaviour, why you put clouds pictures on your profile.” While admitting their love for sky images, another fan pointed out, “Always. But I never changed my DP.” Seemingly referring to the changed DP, one fan complained, “I do not support everything you do.” “Deepu, where is your DP,” lamented one user.

Meanwhile, several colleagues of the actress shared her love for images of the sky. For instance, actress Parvathy said, “Oui!” Writer Jay Shetty said, “Yes, Radhi Devlukia too.” Singer Vijay Yesudas wrote, “Si Senorita.”

Check out the two pictures shared by Deepika Padukone:

In addition, she shared a short video clip of her walking along a path, picturesque postcards featuring clouds, and a charming photo where she grins with genuine joy while posing with local children.

"Katrina Kaif's less public appearances after marriage to Vicky Kaushal; reason is Salman Khan's...

Katrina Kaif has lessened her public appearances after tying the knot with Vicky Kaushal. Here is the real reason!

Katrina Kaif has lessened her public appearances after tying the knot with Vicky Kaushal. Here is the real reason!

Katrina Kaif

Katrina Kaif and Vicky Kaushal married more than a year ago after having a hush-hush affair for a couple of years. While the two married in a private ceremony in Rajasthan, the media expected the celebrity couple to be more open and outgoing after their marriage.

There were expectations that Katrina and Vicky will be spotted together as a couple more often after they have tied the knot. However, the opposite seems to have come true.

Katrina Kaif’s public appearances have lessened for more than a year now much to the surprise of 'Vickat' fans and the paps.

There have been all sorts of speculations including that Vicky does not want Katrina Kaif to be friendly and open and so on. Speculations about the two starting a family have also been going around for some time.

But none of this is true. There is a strong buzz that Katrina is staying away from public appearances to ensure that she is not overexposed to the media and a curiosity and mystery about her and her character in Tiger 3 is created in the minds of her fans.

As Zoya of the Tiger franchise, Kats has worked very hard for the high-octane action sequences that she has performed in Tiger 3 along with Salman Khan.

By staying away from high-profile media attention the Bollywood superstar wants to keep her fans anxious and guessing about her look and performance in the upcoming installment of the Tiger franchise.

Katrina has already completed most of her work for the movie and will be joining the last schedule for this project which is expected to include Shah Rukh Khan as well.

Apart from Tiger 3, Katrina Kaif will be next seen in Merry Christmas alongside Southern star Vijay Sethupathi. The movie is expected to release in December 2023."

For the occasion, Parineeti was seen in a black dress, while Raghav wore a blue shirt. The two looked happy as they waved at a sea of fans who were seen shouting and gesturing at them from below the stands. Parineeti and Raghav are yet to give a statement on their engagement, or even their relationship. However, their roka is already done, according to reports.

India Today quoted a source as saying that while their roka has been done, the wedding is said to take place sometime this October: “Parineeti and Raghav’s roka is done. It was a family affair and they are both very happy. The duo is likely to get married by October-end of this year. Parineeti and Raghav are in no rush and they both have work commitments that they need to take care of before getting into the wedding festivities.”

Earlier, Parineeti had opened up about the wedding rumours in an interview with Lifestyle Asia India. She said, “I will just clarify in case somebody’s gotten anything wrong. So, I mean, if the world was not interested, I would have considered myself unsuccessful. If the world is interested, that means I’ve done something right in my career. So that’s how I see it.”

Parineeti was last seen in the 2022 release Uunchai. Up next, she will be seen in Imtiaz Ali’s Chamkila, in which she is paired opposite Punjabi star Diljit Dosanjh."

"IPL 2023: Parineeti and Raghav Chadha turn heads at IPL match - Rediff Cricket

Parineeti Chopra and Raghav Chadha surprised fans at the IS Bindra Stadium in Mohali as they turned up to watch the IPL match between Punjab Kings and Mumbai Indians.

Actor Parineeti Chopra and Aam Aadmi Party leader Raghav Chadha, who are rumoured to be in a relationship, surprised fans when they turned up together at the IS Bindra Stadium in Mohali to watch the IPL match between Punjab Kings and Mumbai Indians.

There have been rumors circulating for the past few weeks that suggest a possible engagement between Raghav Chadha and Parineeti Chopra, though neither of them has confirmed it.

Last month, when asked about Chopra, Chadha laughed it off and teased, ""Aapko batayenge (will tell you)"".

Perhaps, but the photographs below tell their own story, too!"
"For Bajrang Dal, a PM's Chant. For Bajrang Punia, a Midnight Police Assault

The PM's defence of Bajrang Dal in the wake of Congress’s promise to ban the hardline Hindutva organisation is in sharp contrast to his silence on Olympic medalist Bajrang Purnia’s appeals to seek justice for his colleagues who have been allegedly harassed by the PM's party MP.

Bengaluru: The Delhi police’s midnight manhandling of protesting wrestlers at Jantar Mantar is the latest instance of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Union government’s inclination to crush any form of dissent.

Not many would have thought that even internationally-reputed Indian wrestlers and Olympic medalists like Sakshi Malik and Bajrang Punia will be treated with the same apathy as most other groups who have had reason to protest in the recent past.

The wrestlers have been demanding punishment for alleged sexual offenders in the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI). They claim that the WFI president and BJP MP Brij Bhushan Singh and some coaches have sexually harassed multiple female athletes. For similar accusations against M.J. Akbar, the Union government had swiftly removed the former Union minister. But it has been largely muted in its response to the wrestlers’ protest.

Singh is an extremely powerful and resourceful MP from Uttar Pradesh, and has never hidden his strongman image. He is rumoured to have a direct or indirect role in several crimes, including murders. Even while dismissing such accusations, Singh himself admitted to have committed “only one murder.” He is said to have great influence in over a dozen assembly seats in UP’s Gonda, which is why the BJP is reluctant in letting him go.

The assault on wrestlers on the night of May 3, 2023 is a culmination of many moves already made by the government and its BJP supporters to malign and invalidate the serious charges that the wrestlers have been making against the governing members of the WFI. First, the Union sports minister Anurag Singh Thakur claimed that he had already met the protesting wrestlers for over 12 hours and heard their accusations. However, the wrestlers denied having ever met Thakur, alleging that many requests made to the ministers went unheard.

देश का मान बढ़ाने वाली बेटियाँ आधी रात को सड़क पर रो रही हैं और यौन उत्पीड़न का आरोपी अपने घर में मज़े से सो रहा है क्योंकि वो बीजेपी का नेता है।

वैसे, 'यत्र नार्यस्तु पूज्यन्ते, रमन्ते तत्र देवताः' – यह श्लोक हमारे @narendramodi जी का फेवरेट श्लोक है और उन्हें कंठस्थ है। pic.twitter.com/Q9BJR7bSNL

Singh, on the other hand, accused the wrestlers of conspiring against him at the behest of “a politician and an industrialist”.

At the same time, the BJP and compliant media have only complemented each other in efforts to protect Singh by equating the wrestlers’s protests over sexual harassment allegations with those who it could easily berate as the “tukde tukde gang” or “anti-India”.

Now, following the assault on wrestlers by alleged non-uniformed “drunk” policemen, the government has transformed the site of their protest into a fortress guarded by more policemen. The heavy barricading of the protest site reeks of the criminal treatment that the government has meted out to the Indian wrestlers.

The chain of events around the wrestlers’s agitation only highlights the fact that the Union government may have set a template to deal with all forms of dissent. The justness of the cause simply does not matter to the powers that be, who have shown their incapability to understand any concern outside their own electoral interests.

The year-long farmers’s movement on the borders of Delhi was treated in a similar way.

Firstly, the government and their supporters berated the protesting farmers as stooges of “Khalistani separatists”. The BJP supporters dismissed the agitation as sponsored by rich farmers and criminals when clearly all sections of the farming community were participating in it. The tags of “tukde tukde gang” and “anti-national” were slapped on them from the first day the farmers began agitating. The government officials and ministers engaged with them in multiple rounds of talks but only to hammer down the point that the farming laws could not be revoked. Even when the government was forced to revoke the laws, it has reneged on its promise of legalising the Minimum Support Prices (MSP) system.

Like last night when the wrestlers were faced with police attacking them late in the night, the protesting farmers saw multiple assaults on them at the protest sites late in the night. The barricading of the Jantar Mantar amidst heavy police deployment reminds one of the Delhi police’s attempt to stop the marching farmers by erecting nails and barbed wires on roads and constructing cement walls.

The course of events during the anti-CAA protests were similar.

Castigating the peaceful Muslim protestors down by equating them with “terrorists”, booking many supporters of the movement in conspiracy and UAPA charges, lathi-charging university students and other protestors across the country, creating riot-like conditions through fringe rightwing organisations, ministers deriding the protests that swore on constitutional nationalism with hateful Islamophobhic statements – all happened before the protest sites were uprooted by forces in a joint action by Delhi police and Hindutva organisations.

The more things change, the more they stay the same. The BJP-led government has only proven the old adage to be true in all its aspects.

While the protesting wrestler and Olympic medalist Bajrang Punia, who is agitating in support of his female colleagues, is being reprimanded with the use of sheer force, the Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP has been defending the violent Bajrang Dal in Karnataka’s electoral ground. The Congress’s decision to equate Bajrang Dal and the Popular Front of India while promising to ban fundamentalist organisations has been projected by the saffron forces as an affront to Hindu faith.

Most Karnataka residents are familiar with Bajrang Dal’s tendency to stir up religious controversies where there are none. Most of them also know about the organisation’s proclivity for violence while whipping up hate campaigns against Muslims. But that perhaps doesn’t bother the Prime Minister as he has not only defended Bajrang Dal but has also asked voters to chant “Jai Bajrang Bali” before voting. In all his rallies over the last two days, he has attacked the Congress for allegedly denigrating Lord Hanuman by promising to ban Bajrang Dal.

Modi doesn’t mind stirring up polarising sentiments if they entail political benefits to his party. In Karnataka, his last-mile push has been that of hardline Hindutva, alienating Muslims further from the mainstream, and using Bajrang Dal as a prop to consolidate Hindus along religious lines.

Should the PFI now say that the central ban on the organisation was an attack on Islam? BJP’s logic was tersely summed by senior journalist Neena Vyas. “Does the PM know Ram naam is not the same as Ram Sena, Bajrangbali not equal to Bajrang Dal? The latter, the Dal, has repeatedly shown itself to be above law…When BJP split the Shiv Sena was it insulting Lord Shiva?” she tweeted.

The government’s response to both Bajrang Dal and Bajrang Punia has been a tale of opposites. One Bajrang has shamed the government for inaction against an alleged sexual offender, and was, therefore, dealt with a heavy hand, with a complete lack of humanism. The other Bajrang that has frequently seen itself as above law is empowered and encouraged to act with further impunity by none other than the Prime Minister.

The hollowness of BJP’s slogan “sabka saath, sabka vikaas” shows through the two episodes. They also prove that the government has different yardsticks for different people. As long as violent organisations like Bajrang Dal advance BJP’s political and ideological interests, they can be accorded a position above law and a place above criticism. But those asking for justice will be nipped in the bud. It doesn’t matter that those seeking justice could be Olympic medalists who brought glory to the nation."

"Wrestlers Protest, Jantar Mantar: Delhi Police Counters Wrestlers' 'Attack By Drunk Cops' Charge: 10 Facts

Wrestlers protesting at Delhi's Jantar Mantar have alleged that they were manhandled by drunk policemen late Wednesday night. The wrestlers claim that they were assaulted by cops when they wanted to bring in folding beds to the protest site.

Wrestlers Protest at Jantar Mantar: wrestlers have accused Delhi Police of manhandling.

Several wrestlers were hit on the head with two sustaining injuries. One person fell unconscious and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment.

According to the police, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Somnath Bharti reached the protest site with folding beds without permission. When the police intervened, a minor altercation broke out following which the AAP leader and two others were detained, police said.

In a video that is now viral on social media, some protesters can be heard accusing police personnel of attacking wrestlers under the influence of alcohol.

""A drunk policeman, Dharemendra, abused Vinesh Phogat and got involved in a scuffle with us,"" said former wrestler Rajveer. Olympian and Commonwealth Games Gold medallist Geeta Phogat has said that her younger brother Dushyant Phogat's head ""was cracked open"".

Asian and Commonwealth Games gold medallist Vinesh Phogat broke down and said they were not criminals to be treated in such manner. ""If you want to kill us, then kill us,"" Ms Phogat said crying. Olympics bronze medallist Bajrang Punia, speaking with NDTV, said, ""I request the government that it take back all the medals I have won.""

Delhi Police have dismissed allegations of some policemen being drunk. The police said that no force was used against the protesters and that five police personnel sustained injuries in the altercation.

Following the clash, heavy police force has been deployed at the protest site and the whole area has been barricaded, not allowing media personnel to reach the protesting wrestlers.

Congress leader Deepender Singh Hooda who reached the protest site late at night claimed that he was detained by Delhi Police and taken to Vasant Vihar police station.

India's top wrestlers are protesting against the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief and BJP MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh over sexual harassment allegations. The six-time MP has denied all allegations leveled against him.

The Supreme Court today closed proceedings on the petition filed by three women wrestlers who have levelled sexual harassment allegations against Mr Singh. The court noted that FIRs have been registered and seven of the complainants have been provided adequate security.

"FIR served purpose of plea: Supreme Court asks wrestlers to approach lower courts - India Today

The Supreme Court closed the proceedings on a plea filed by women wrestlers against the WFI chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh. The wrestlers had been demanding the ongoing investigation be monitored by a retired or a serving high court judge.

By Kanu Sarda, Aneesha Mathur: The Supreme Court on Thursday closed the proceedings on a plea filed by women wrestlers against Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh and asked the protesting grapplers to approach a lower court.

A bench headed by the Chief Justice of India, DY Chandrachud, noted that the petition was filed seeking an FIR and granted liberty to the petitioners to approach the jurisdictional magistrate or the Delhi High Court for any further grievances.

During the hearing, senior advocate Narender Hooda requested the bench to monitor the investigation as the conduct of the Delhi Police in refusing to take action till the Supreme Court's intervention is questionable.

""We have only said that we are closing the proceedings at this stage, confining ourselves to the prayers. We have not said that this is not worthy of being monitored. You can approach the Magistrate or the Delhi High Court if there are any issues,"" the CJI said.

The bench also noted in the order that the Delhi Police have recorded the minor's statement on April 29 and the statements of four others on May 3 and that the police are taking steps to record statements before a magistrate under Section 164 of the CrPC.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Delhi Police, told the bench that security arrangements have been made for the minor complainant as per the directions of the court and security has also been provided for six other girls at Jantar Mantar.

Senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing on behalf of Brij Bhushan, told the bench that personal allegations have been made against him without making him a party in the case.

On the bench's query on recording of the statement, the Solicitor General said, ""Investigation in this case was done by a senior lady officer and we are doing our best neutrally.""

To this, senior advocate Narender Hooda told the bench that the seven complainants approached the Delhi Police with their complaints on April 21. But no FIR was immediately registered, and they had to knock on the doors of the Supreme Court. Finally, the FIRs were lodged only on April 28.

""So far as the accused is concerned, he has become a TV star. Every day he gives interviews to TV channels. He is taking the names of the complainants, he is naming their akharas. The accused said that he has not been approached by the police so far. Last time, this court said that the identity of the complainants must not be disclosed, but the accused is taking names,"" Hooda further said.

Objecting to the submissions, Salve said, ""Complainants are themselves sitting in protest.""

Hooda then referred to the scuffle between the Delhi Police and the wrestlers last night.

Responding to this, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said two political leaders of a particular party went there with beds, which the police sought to stop, and this led to a scuffle. He clarified that the theory that the police were drunk is incorrect as the medical tests showed nothing.WHY ARE WRESTLERS PROTESTING?

The second phase of protests by wrestlers began on April 23 at Delhi's Jantar Mantar. They have accused the WFI chief Brij Bhushan Singh of sexual assault allegations, including that of a minor wrestler.WHAT WFI CHIEF SAID

Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh has denied all charges against him, claiming these protests were politically motivated.

In fact, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh has said that he has got proof to show that protests by wrestlers were part of a ""conspiracy"" hatched by the Congress and wrestler Bajrang Punia. He said that his mere resignation was not what these protestors had been seeking.POLICE ACTION

The Delhi Police has filed two FIRs against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh after the Supreme Court intervened. “The first FIR has been registered under the POCSO Act along with relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). It was filed based on the allegations of a minor. The second FIR was registered for a comprehensive investigation into the complaints by other complainants under relevant sections pertaining to outraging of modesty,” the Delhi Police said in a statement.

The Congress has been running a high-decibel campaign in Karnataka—and rightfully so — it is a matter of prestige for the party to win the election. Its party chief, Mallikarjun Kharge, is a Kannadiga and historically, Karnataka elects alternate governments. So, if history is the only indication, the Congress should wrest power from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). It is a separate matter that the historical trends have been shattered multiple times under Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

However, let us for a moment consider that the Congress may return to power — what happens next? During the last stint of the Congress government in Karnataka, the FDI annual inflow was about Rs 30,000 crore. This investment saw a three-fold increase to Rs 90,000 crore under the current BJP regime. Clearly, the BJP government put Karnataka on an accelerated path of development with its double-engine government and attuned policies. In order to sustain this type of growth, the BJP government also created a network of infrastructure projects which further led to a significant increase in the need for manpower, skilled and unskilled.

If the Congress returns to power, what happens to these businesses which have invested in the state due to their confidence in the BJP’s double-engine government? One hopes the Congress returning to power doesn’t spook businesses and force them to move out to other states where there is greater ease of doing business.

Now, let’s discuss welfare schemes. A Congress prime minister in the past has confessed that for every rupee which is sent to the people during their regime, a whopping 85 percent is pocketed by middlemen. Little seems to have changed over the years. This leaves measly remnant funds for the welfare of the needy people of Karnataka.

The irony of the Congress manifesto for Karnataka is that while it is called ‘Sarva Janangada Thota’ which translates to ‘peaceful garden of communities’, on-ground, it is a proposal to further inequalities, creating divisions between religious groups and communities. They propose to increase reservations for Muslims and STs by four percent each, and for SCs by another three percent—overall bringing up the total reservation to 75 percent by increasing reservations for other communities. They have also proposed to set up ‘social harmony panels’ at panchayats. There are multiple problems with this. The first and most important problem is that the Constitution of India does not allow for religion-based reservations. But then again, when has the Congress been a torchbearer of upholding the Constitution?

The second issue is that considering all of the above in context with their other intentions such as appeasement of terror organisations like the banned PFI and banning the Bajrang Dal which works for social causes in the name of Hindu God Bajrang Bali, the Congress leadership will actively work to submerge the majority community in Karnataka. In the name of ‘social harmony’, Hindus will likely be the community taking the brickbats, living in fear, as a result of Congress’ policies of empowering radical elements.

Nitish Kumar Should Stop 'Daydreaming' About Becoming PM, Pay Attention to Bihar: BJP

BJP Seeks Votes in Name of Cows, but Has Never Served Them, Says Chhattisgarh CM Baghel

Historically, the Congress has appeased the Muslims — but little do they know that even the Indian Muslims are now looking at a path of development versus lip service and radicalisation. In the past several elections, it has become clear that there are many minority pockets where Prime Minister Modi enjoys Muslim votes, especially votes from Muslim women due to the penetration of the government schemes trickling down to them—without any communal discrimination. The BJP has vowed to bring in the Uniform Civil Code to further this empowerment of minorities and bring them into the mainstream developmental agenda of the country.

The Congress often criticises the BJP for not focusing on local issues like inflation. However, it was indeed during Indira Gandhi’s tenure that the inflation of independent India was at its highest at 34.7 percent. This was not a one-off phenomenon. Even in Manmohan Singh’s second term during the UPA government, the inflation remained in double-digits, breaking the backs of businessmen and common Indians. We have already discussed how corruption is rampant in the Congress ecosystem of gobbling up 85 percent of the funds meant for the poor. In order to keep their coffers full, during the UPA term, they had invented 10 crore ‘non-existent’ people and enlisted them as beneficiaries of various government schemes. Since those people did not exist in the first place, all that money went to the Congress loot. With the direct digital payment systems brought in by the Modi government, this scope of financial leakage has practically become zero. There may be a very real but scary possibility of the Congress scrapping the use of Direct Benefit Payments of the state schemes in order to keep their treasuries full if it comes to power in the state.

The Congress needs to understand that new India has moved on from its colonial subservient mentality of remaining underdeveloped. It is now fixated on only one thing — growth — that too, fast-paced, unstoppable growth. Without any real policy solutions offered by the Congress towards fulfilling these dreams, the party will find itself on the back foot, despite anti-incumbency hitting the current BJP government in the state. The Congress needs to change before it’s too late.

"Karnataka elections: BJP’s strategy and challenges | Latest News India - Hindustan Times

The BJP faces a crucial test in the Vokkaliga-dominated Old Mysuru region, where the party has never won more than 11 out of the 61 seats in previous polls | Latest News India

Bengaluru At a party meeting sometime towards the end of 2022, Union home minister Amit Shah is learnt to have expressed annoyance over the lack of preparations by the leaders of the Karnataka unit if the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for the upcoming assembly polls. Shah, at the time, flagged the failure to groom new leaders and identify issues that would form the bedrock of the election narrative, and most of all, the lag in strengthening the booths in the Old Mysuru region, which sends nearly a third of the legislators to the 224-member assembly.

“He (Shah) was livid...,” recalled a party leader privy to the meeting, requesting anonymity.

The leader said that Shah, who is also the party’s chief strategist, was disappointed with the state unit’s plans to breach the opposition bastion, identified as a significant factor to propel the BJP towards winning a majority on its own — something that has been elusive in the past elections.

While the BJP has a reasonably strong presence in the north and central regions of the state where the politically powerful Lingayat community sustains the party’s growth, and in the coastal region where its ideological fountainhead the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) has helped make inroads, the party faces a crucial test in the Vokkaliga-dominated Old Mysuru region. The BJP has never won more than 11 out of the 61 seats in the region in previous polls.

Eyeing the Vokkaliga bastion/ weak seats

To address this, a concerted campaign with senior party leaders making multiple visits has been mounted in the Old Mysuru region. Shah, party president JP Nadda, and a bevy of national and state leaders have already addressed rallies in the region ahead of the May 10 assembly elections.

“In Tumkur, Chikkaballapura, Kolar, Kodagu, Ramanagar, Mandya, Hassan, (and) Chamrajanagar, the party began work on a two-pronged approach… We inducted strong leaders and are targeting our opponents on issues such as poor performance and dynastic politics,” said the party leader quoted above.

The BJP has also redoubled efforts in constituencies where its candidates lost by a slim margin in 2018, and identified 17 such seats across the state where the loss margin was less than 3,000 votes. “If we add these 17 to the 104 that we won in 2018, it puts us in a comfortable position to win,” said a second party leader, also asking not to be named.

Though the party has given prominence to Vokkaliga leaders such as Lok Sabha MP Shobha Karandlaje, party general secretary CT Ravi, and state minister CN Ashwath Narayan, it is still banking on community leaders from other parties to facilitate its entry into the Janata Dal (Secular), or JD(S), bastion. The party is hopeful that Congress leaders who defected in 2019 and helped the BJP wrest the power from the JD(S)-Congress combine, will be able to add seats to its tally.

“The entry of leaders such as D Sudhakar, HT Somashekar, V Gopalaiah, among others, gave a fillip to the party’s Vokkaligga outreach. The party’s bypoll win in 2019 in KR Pete and Sira for the first time has kindled hope of a better show this time,” said the first functionary.

Caste balance

Overtures towards the Vokkaliga community included initiatives such as the installation of Kempegowda’s statue at the Bengaluru International Airport. But the outreach towards the community that wields clout in 40-plus seats also puts the BJP at risk of upsetting other castes. So there is an attempt to retaining support of the so-called upper castes, and the Lingayats, even as the BJP wants the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and other backward classes (OBCs) to back its quest for retaining power.

“The SC, ST and OBCs are not the exclusive domain of any party. So, the effort has been to prop leaders in each community without disturbing the equations. The Congress had an AHINDA formula to woo the Alpasankhyataru (minorities), Hindulidavaru (backward classes) and Dalitaru (Dalit) communities. Our social engineering strategy was retaining the LIBRA (Lingayat plus Brahmins) and adding the AHINDA by rejigging the reservation,” said a third state leader.

The Karnataka government announced the scrapping of 4% reservation for Muslims and redistributed it equally among the Vokkaligas and Lingayats. Additionally, it increased the reservation for STs from 3% to 7% and for SCs from 15% to 17%. The new policy will not come into effect till after the elections.

By fielding 47 Vokkaliga, 68 Lingayat, 37 SC, and 18 ST candidates, the BJP is hoping that its claims of “politically empowering” all castes will hold it in good stead.

Referring to the importance of caste in the state’s polity, Sugata Srinivasaraju, political commentator and author said, “Caste is a central idea in Karnataka and the electoral contest in the state has mostly centred around caste. But this time, there is an assertion by the sub-castes that are looking for bigger political representation and share in power.”

Double engine/ leadership crisis

While the party made its “double engine” governance — used in reference to BJP-led governments at the Centre and in the state — the mainstay of its electoral campaign to override issues of anti-incumbency and administrative deficiencies, the absence of a clear chief ministerial candidate is another challenge that the ruling party has to overcome.

The BJP’s bid to capitalise on the “clean image” of incumbent chief minister Basavaraj Bommai appeared to come a cropper after allegations of graft and the Congress’s aggressive “PayCM campaign” to target the government on issues of corruption.

There is strong support for former CM BS Yediyurappa, a Lingayat strongman who was replaced by Bommai in 2020, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi commands a strong following from across castes, especially among the youth. However, the party is facing a predicament since the Lingayats want a clear announcement about the CM candidate. “CM Bommai, a Lingayat, has not been able to secure the kind of following that BSY (Yediyuappa) has,” admitted the first leader. Withstanding pressure to name a CM, the party high command has opted for a cautious approach of leading with the Modi-Yediyurappa combination.

The BJP has also sought to alleviate concerns that it overlooked the Lingayat leadership. Yediyruppa’s announcement of not contesting polls and the exit of senior leaders like former CM Jagdish Shettar gave the opposition a chance to accuse the BJP of marginalising the community. The BJP, however, has been able to counter the narrative by asserting that the replacements for those who exited are from the Lingayat community itself.

Rebels/anti-incumbency

Another challenge that the party faces is the possibility of rebels playing spoilsport and adversely impacting its electoral fortune, as it happened in Himachal Pradesh. Though senior leaders had reached out to the state unit, explaining the need to give new faces a chance to be able to buck anti-incumbency, there has been a lot of resentment over dropping sitting legislators.

Apart from Shettar, several other leaders such as former deputy CM Laxman Savadi, and Ayanur Manjunath, now contesting on a JD(S) ticket from Shivamogga central constituency, went public with their disappointment at being dropped. Senior leaders, barring KS Eshwarappa, have not supported the party’s bid to encourage new leadership by fielding 72 new faces.

Narrative

While the Congress has accused the state government of administrative lapses, faulted the Union government for failing to tame inflation and harped on the issue of corruption, the BJP is hoping that the image and popularity of PM Modi will overshadow local issues.

The BJP has had to reconsider its poll narrative from being overtly polarising, given the impact it had in consolidating the minority votes in favour of the Congress and the little impact issues such as enforcing ban on hijab and halal food had in the state.

Referring to the BJP sidestepping issues such as interfaith marriages and religious conversions, and its bid to recast Tipu Sultan as an anti-Hindu ruler, Srinivasaraju said, “The BJP has had to reconfigure its election narrative from Hindutva to caste because ideological issues did not find great traction across the state. Hindutva has resonated in the coastal belt, not so much in other parts of Karnataka. Even among the Lingayats, there is an assertion by the subcastes.”

The party is, therefore, banking on development projects and fiscal achievements and the “Modi factor” to counter the allegations of rampant corruption and infrastructure deficiencies.

On whether the PM will be able to set the narrative and help the BJP overcome the impediments it faces in retaining power, professor of political science at the Bangalore University, SY Surendra Kumar said, “Modi’s personality and the public opinion about him will play an important role in the elections. It will help the BJP overcome its weaknesses. His image among people, particularly the youth, who see him as a hard-working, honest leader who is driven to deliver is an advantage for the BJP.”

"5 Reasons Why BJP May Prove Pollsters Wrong In Karnataka

With Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself on a mission to secure ""nothing short of a majority"" in Karnataka and a week left for the polls, the political countdown in the state may have just begun.

The biggest ammunition in the BJP's arsenal is Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

There are five days left for the Karnataka election campaign to end, and challenging the state's poll history, which shows that none of the ruling parties have retained power in the last 38 years, is probably the biggest task at hand for the BJP this year.

While some opinion polls have suggested that the Congress is inching towards the majority, it may not be the most accurate picture of the real situation on the ground, as several instances in past elections have shown that the last-mile voter connect and booth management of the BJP are often better than the Congress, and in tightly contested fights with a third smaller party in the fray, the BJP often gains. In Karnataka, particularly, the Congress faces the challenge of converting its vote share into seat share at the constituency level, something it has struggled with in the past.

No chief minister has been able to retain power in Karnataka, and hence, while the odds might seem stacked against the BJP, it is important to remember that the party did come back to power in states such as Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, which have had similar election outcomes of voting out the incumbent. It also won a clear majority both in Tripura and Goa, where pollsters had predicted a tough battle.

With Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself on a mission to secure ""nothing short of a majority"" in Karnataka and a week left for the polls, the political countdown in the state may have just begun.

Here are the five factors that can alter the poll results:

Modi Factor

The biggest ammunition in the BJP's arsenal is Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and in the last two weeks, the PM has scaled up his campaign in the State, trying to connect with the voters, requesting them to vote for a ""double-engine sarkar."" In his roadshow in Central Karnataka on Tuesday, he assured an enthusiastic crowd that ""he has seen them, and if they don't stop waving, their arms will start hurting."" In Hospet on Tuesday, after specifically asking voters to take an oath that they will support him, he made a gesture of patting the back of the party worker who was translating his speech in Kannada for doing a good job. ""The PM's sustained presence in the State has rejuvenated the josh in every karyakarta. There is definitely an upswing in the mood because it seems he is talking to us,"" a party functionary from Chitradurga said. The emphasis on the PM's campaign has also taken the attention away from the complaints of party leaders sulking for not getting a ticket. Now, from Friday to Sunday, he is expected to camp in the state, addressing rallies in different places, and covering the important districts of Bellari, Shivamogga, Badami, Nanjangud, and a grand show in Bengaluru. Political experts said in Karnataka, the Modi factor is known to impact the voters, resulting in a swing for the BJP. The PM recently also addressed nearly 53,000 booth workers virtually asking them to be partners in fulfilling his vision for the State, which the party said gave a lot of boost to the campaign.

Vote-Share vs Seats

It is important to remember that Karnataka, a state where parties have always had smaller vote-shares, also has a demography that plays an important role in the poll outcomes. The BJP has often never had a vote share higher than the Congress that is spread across the state, while the BJP is concentrated in many specific regions, which makes its gains often higher. The party's vote share and tally have been steadily increasing in the state since 1989, which shows the party has been expanding its voter base in Karnataka. The BJP has a much better seat share-vote share ratio and has always beaten the Congress at this, except in 2013 when it was reduced significantly. Even the JD(S) with a much smaller vote share ends up with proportionally a higher seat share as its support base is concentrated in the specific region of Old Mysuru.

Caste Calculus

The BJP has kept caste at the centre of its ticket distribution in the State. Party leaders said there were apprehensions of consolidation among both SC (Left) and SC (Right) groups in the State due to the outreach by Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge, and some discontent among ST communities, but with internal reservation announced by the State government, the BJP is likely to gain. Additionally, the party has put in great effort to consolidate its Lingayat voter base. The central leadership appointed BS Yediyurappa as a Parliamentary Board member of the party and also increased reservation for the Lingayat community, apart from doing the same for Vokkaligas, another dominant caste in the State. Yediyurappa, arguably the only mass leader the BJP has in the State, has been touring the State asking people to vote for the party. He has visited 40 assembly constituencies in 18 districts in the last three weeks, while his son BS Vijayendra who is also contesting polls from Shikaripura has a target of visiting at least 25 seats before the campaign ends. But the BJP's strategists know that the party is yet to get a full majority in the State Assembly on its own, but they say that even at its worst in 2013, when BS Yediyurappa had deserted the party and come up with a party of his own, it could have managed 92 seats if they had fought together, and now with the added factor of the charisma of the PM, the expanded BJP in Old Mysuru region, and the voter connect of the BJP, it can only do better.

Management Of Polls

A host of central BJP leaders have been given specific tasks in Karnataka, and these include many MPs who have been camping in seats seen as difficult for the BJP. The party is focusing heavily on Bengaluru, which accounts for 28 of the total 224 assembly seats in the state, and also Belagavi which has 18 seats. Apart from the PM, Home Minister Amit Shah, who started his campaign from Old Mysuru, has already come to the State 20 times in the last 70 days, and his major area of focus has been the toughest seats for the party, particularly the Lingayat belt of North and North Central Karnataka. The party feels that the north and north-central districts of Bidar, Gulbarga, Yadgir, Raichur, Bellary, Davangere, Koppal, Bijapur, Bagalkote, Haveri, Gadag, and Dharwad may prove decisive in the mandate, and the party has devised a specific strategy for these districts alone. While the most important challenges for the BJP are countering the anti-incumbency, the guarantees of the Congress, particularly income support to women and unemployed youth, are issues BJP leaders have been asked to aggressively counter. ""The Congress has assured Rs 2,000 monthly to women-run households, but we are telling them how many promises has the Congress kept in the past,"" a senior functionary of the BJP said.

Bajrang Dal And A Fresh Lease To Hindutva

While Karnataka has often been in the news for issues such as the ban on the hijab, a political fight over Azaan, and Hindu groups calling for the economic boycott of Muslim vendors, the BJP has strategically pushed a local caste calculus over the party's saffron appeal, knowing very well that Hindutva has its limitations in the state. But the Congress manifesto calling for a ban on the Bajrang Dal and likening it to the now-banned Islamist organisation Popular Front of India has filled BJP workers and voters, said party leaders. ""And the PM standing in Hosapet, which is known to be the birthplace of Lord Hanuman, spoke about it. It is now an issue here,"" said a BJP functionary.

On Wednesday, the PM chanted 'Bajrangbali ki Jai' in his rally in coastal Karnataka that led to loud applause in the audience. This matter will be central to the BJP's last leg of the campaign, party functionaries said. While the Congress feels the issue might consolidate Muslim votes in its favour, including in Old Mysuru, where a significant section of Muslims prefer to vote for the JD(S), the party is also anxious about this upsetting Hindu voters.

"Embargoed: A K’taka election results copy in advance- The New Indian Express

Projecting numbers of who is winning and losing is another form of forwarding well-honed narratives and prejudices.

Projecting numbers of who is winning and losing is another form of forwarding well-honed narratives and prejudices.

The Karnataka Assembly elections are exactly a week away. That’s all the more reason to indulge in the grand tradition of speculation that all polls lovingly foster. The fraud of pretending to get into the minds of millions to decipher the choices they will make, or have made, in the deepest recesses of their mind, sitting in the most private corners of their home, is a rather innocuous one. It is happily permitted in the name of democracy. It is an enjoyable game that can be advertised as a freebie of the ‘free world’.

The underlying truth, however, is that projecting numbers of who is winning and who is losing is another form of forwarding well-honed narratives and prejudices of the season, while the actual process of voting is infinitely more complex. At one point, my former editor, Vinod Mehta, decided to never run opinion polls. This was after he had got a few of them horribly wrong. He understood it to be worse than playing the stock market or T20 cricket or going to the racecourse. It put everything at stake, especially credibility.

Anyway, after this self-deprecatory exercise, let’s not resist the temptation but try another route by answering two significant questions. One: If the Bharatiya Janata Party is swept away in Karnataka, what could the specifics and contexts of its defeat be? Two: If the Congress party does not get a majority on its own, what will the possible explanation on May 13 be when results crawl out of the voting machines?

These could be among the top reasons we’ll speculate ten days from now if the BJP is unable to retain power in the state:

1. Quota reworking that the party tried perhaps did not go down well. It tried to please all but, in the end, pleased none. Basavaraj Bommai of 2023 is likened to Veerappa Moily of 1994, when the Congress misjudged quotas.

2. The Lingayats as a community were angered because the party attempted to split them between the Panchamasali subsect and the rest. A charge that was heaped on the Congress in the 2018 election when it pushed for a separate religion status to Lingayats.

3. The Lingayats thought the party showed the door to B S Yediyurappa rather unceremoniously and that there was little hope for the community without him at the helm. Perhaps Yediyurappa himself did not get too involved in the polls although he made the right noises.

4. The Brahmin versus Lingayat (read Santhosh versus Yediyurappa) narrative perhaps gained ground. The ambition of B L Santhosh, a Brahmin, may have drained the party’s hopes.

5. Indifferent ticket distribution may have hurt the party’s chances. There was no pattern or narrative to who was given the ticket and for what reason. In the process of ticket distribution, the party forgot its own narrative against dynastic politics, corruption, rowdy elements, money power, etc.

6. The Hindutva rhetoric did not offer sufficient air cover. It was toned down months ago: the hardcore BJP voter perhaps thought this was hypocritical. There was dissidence even in the coastal districts—stereotyped as the state’s Hindutva laboratory.

7. Too many ‘prabharis’ spoiled the broth, with Arun Singh, D K Aruna, Dharmendra Pradhan, Annamalai, Mansukh Mandaviya doing poll management. Perhaps coordination between them became a casualty.

8. The party’s plea to entrust (rather handover) the state to Narendra Modi and forget about everything else may have offended regional pride and aspirations. Perhaps the ‘double engine’ argument sounded too clever by half.

9. The BJP could not make inroads into the Vokkaliga belt because it attacked former Prime Minister H D Deve Gowda or provoked the faux Nandini versus Amul debate or foisted a false narrative related to Tipu Sultan’s death.

10. The karma of Operation Lotus may have caught up with the party. The 17 who crossed over from other parties to prop up the BJP government in 2019 may have upset the loyal BJP worker with their power, aggression and influence.

11. Narendra Modi could not make any impact with his road shows and rallies.

12. The BJP top leadership wanted to change the political game in Karnataka permanently, and therefore let matters slip under the existing set of state leaders. They will perhaps install a new set of leaders now.

Now, to top logic that may deny Congress the opportunity of forming a government on its own:

1. It lazily hoped that it would win by default because the BJP had floundered badly.

2. The absence of a national narrative for the party.

3. Competition between top Congress leaders for the CM’s chair may have led to undercutting votes.

4. Perhaps big leaders like Siddaramaiah did not appear very confident, reflected in the way he went round the state in search of a constituency.

5. They may have failed to project a big development dream for the state and create enough reservoirs of hope. Their ‘guarantee’ schemes may have sounded commonplace.

6. A majority of the Muslims may have ignored them, and the oppressed Dalits (in greater numbers) may have decided to stick with the BJP. The OBC communities (except for a couple of them in a 100-odd list) may have failed to see a future in the Congress party.

7. The party was perhaps overly enthusiastic in ‘welcoming Lingayats home’ and forgot to woo other communities. Perhaps people like Jagadish Shettar and Laxman Savadi who crossed over from BJP became a serious liability.

8. In the Cauvery basin area, Vokkaligas mostly remained loyal to Janata Dal Secular and its patriarch H D Deve Gowda. The JDS may have snatched away a good chunk of the anti-BJP anger votes.

9. The party’s status quo on tickets did not go down well. It was all about the party’s old elite.

10. Beneficiaries of government welfare schemes remained loyal to the Modi regime.

11. Corruption as a narrative may not have had any traction. After all, D K Shivakumar, the party president, has faced serious charges over the years and also went to jail. For Congress to hurl corruption charges at the BJP was perhaps a defensive move.

12. Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Yatra had little effect and his disqualification did not accrue victimhood.

Much like Chelsea’s recent form, this article is not meant to be taken seriously.

As Bayern Munich flounder in their search for a new striker, a certain Argentinian wonder searches for a new club.

Yes, it’s all but confirmed — as reported by Fabrizio Romano, Leo Messi is set to leave Paris Saint-Germain this summer. The club will not extend his contract, which means one of the best players in the history of the sport will be available for free this summer. Its an ignominious end to the Argentinian’s stay in the French capital, especially considering the fanfare when he was first signed from FC Barcelona. No Champions League, barely any titles at all to speak of.

The breaking point, apparently, was Messi’s unsanctioned visit to Saudi Arabia during the middle of the season, which neither his teammates nor the club were aware of. Why Saudi Arabia? Messi happens to be their brand ambassador, but they’re also major geopolitical rivals to Qatar, who own Paris Saint-Germain. You can only imagine the reaction in the PSG boardroom. In the end, the player was suspended for two weeks as punishment. The relationship between the club and Messi is irrevocably damaged.

This is a perfect opportunity for Bayern Munich. Signing Messi is an ideal move, for a variety of reasons:

It honestly seems like the perfect match. Brazzo should’ve picked up the phone and made the call yesterday. You need to show this kind of impetus if you want to be successful in this business.

Major rivals for Bayern will be Inter Miami in MLS and the Saudis themselves, both of whom have the history and pedigree that far outstrips a small provincial team from a German backwater. However, if the board work hard, they can definitely get this done. Fans should start a campaign immediately.

Bring Leo Messi to Bayern Munich!

"Paris Saint-Germain Set For Lionel Messi Divorce After Suspending Superstar For Unauthorised Trip To Saudi Arabia | Football News

Greeted as a hero by adoring supporters when he arrived in Paris from Barcelona in August 2021, Messi was supposed to be the man to deliver PSG elusive Champions League success.

Paris Saint-Germain's relationship with Lionel Messi is set to end after two underwhelming years following the French champions' decision to suspend the seven-time Ballon d'Or winner for going on an unauthorised trip to Saudi Arabia. Greeted as a hero by adoring supporters when he arrived in Paris from Barcelona in August 2021, Messi was supposed to be the man to deliver PSG elusive Champions League success. It has not worked out and some of those fans had recently turned against a player they see as a symbol of all the club have done wrong in focusing on superstar signings while failing to build a genuinely competitive team.Having at one point looked set to secure Messi's signature for another season, the Qatar-owned club briefed a month ago that the player was now ""much more likely"" to depart at the campaign's end when his contract expires.This week's events are surely the final straw.Messi, who will be 36 in June, played in PSG's insipid 3-1 home defeat by Lorient in Ligue 1 on Sunday.He then travelled to Saudi Arabia to fulfil commitments as part of a contract with the country's tourist office.AdvertisementAs a result Messi missed a training session pencilled in for Monday following the weekend defeat.PSG acted swiftly to punish Messi, despite his status as one of the sport's greats.He has been suspended even though PSG still need points to retain the French title with five matches left this season.A source with knowledge of the disciplinary procedure told AFP that Argentina's World-Cup winning captain would be sidelined for ""several days"".AdvertisementVarious media in France reported he would be suspended for two weeks.""He cannot train, cannot play, and will not be paid while disciplinary measures are in place,"" the source added.Hours later the Saudi tourist board issued a press release to celebrate Messi's visit and detail his ""jam-packed itinerary"" which included feeding a herd of gazelles.""Messi's visit to Saudi was packed with exciting activities, with something for everyone in the family,"" it said.Meanwhile his teammates were back on the training ground in Paris after suffering a sixth defeat in 17 Ligue 1 matches in 2023.Is Barcelona return possible?That Messi should miss training to fly instead to Saudi Arabia could be seen as especially embarrassing for PSG's owners given recent frictions between Qatar and its Gulf neighbour.Saudi Arabia imposed a diplomatic blockade on Qatar in 2017 along with the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain, although a reconciliation accord was sealed in January 2021 and the countries have since renewed relations.The front page of Wednesday's edition of French sports daily L'Equipe carried images of Messi and PSG's Qatari president Nasser al-Khelaifi. ""The Break-up"" read the headline.When Messi was unveiled by PSG, he said winning another Champions League title was his ""dream"" and that he thought he was in ""the ideal place"" to do it.Yet it turns out that adding an ageing Messi to an attack already containing Kylian Mbappe and Neymar is not a recipe for European success.With Messi, PSG have suffered consecutive exits from the Champions League in the last 16.They did win Ligue 1 last season and are on course to do so again this year, even if they limp towards the finish line.Messi scored just 11 goals in a difficult first season in Paris as he digested his departure from Barcelona.He has contributed 20 in all competitions this season and is also the leading assist-provider in Ligue 1.Messi has developed a good understanding with Mbappe but there have only been glimpses of him at his very best.PSG's chances of winning the Champions League will not be diminished by losing Messi, but it remains to be seen where the player himself goes next.Barcelona have made no secret of their desire to bring him back, yet the Catalans' ongoing financial issues cast doubt on their ability to make a deal happen.There are no other obvious options available to Messi in Europe, meaning he may have to consider a move elsewhere.MLS outfit Inter Miami, co-owned by David Beckham, have long been considered a possible destination for Messi.Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.comAnother is Saudi Arabia, where he could renew his rivalry with Cristiano Ronaldo, who recently moved to Riyadh side Al Nassr.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)Comments Topics mentioned in this article Paris Saint-Germain  Argentina  Lionel Messi FootballGet the latest updates on IPL 2023 and check out  IPL Schedule and Live Cricket Score. Like us on Facebook or follow us on Twitter for more sports updates.

"Lionel Messi no closer to Barcelona return despite imminent PSG exit as huge Saudi offer, MLS interest & Premier League suitors could prevent reunion | Goal.com India

Barcelona are not making progress in their pursuit of Lionel Messi, GOAL understands.

Barcelona are not making progress in their pursuit of Lionel Messi, GOAL understands.

WHAT HAPPENED? Barcelona are no closer to bringing Messi back to Camp Nou than they were a couple of months ago, GOAL understands, with their financial constraints and strong interest in the player from elsewhere proving to be major obstacles. Though Xavi is pushing for his return and the dressing room would be delighted to have him, Messi still does not have a specific offer from Barcelona. His return is not impossible, but it is very complicated.

AND WHAT'S MORE: GOAL has also discovered that there is a concrete, substantial offer for Messi in Saudi Arabia that promises an astronomical salary. In MLS, Inter Miami's interest is also legitimate - and growing - while there are Premier League teams monitoring his situation.

THE BIGGER PICTURE: Even at 35, Messi's availability on a free transfer this summer has prompted an intense global battle for his services. Not only is he still productive on the pitch, but he is also a massive commercial draw.

IN THREE PHOTOS:

WHAT NEXT FOR MESSI? He's currently suspended for taking an unsanctioned trip to Saudi Arabia, and it remains unclear how long PSG will persist with him when he returns considering they've already run away with the Ligue 1 title."
"Karan Johar Writes 'Dear Opinion...' After Trolls Accused Him of Sending Alia Bhatt to MET Gala

Karan Johar pens a cryptic note slamming trolls post Alia Bhatt's Met Gala debut.

Curated By:  Aditi Giri

News18.com

Last Updated: May 04, 2023, 14:00 IST

Mumbai, India

Karan Johar wittingly slams trolls with an Instagram post.

Karan Johar enjoys a massive fan following but at the same time is also subjected to trolling. The filmmaker makes sure that he comes out stronger against all the odds. His close friend and actress Alia Bhatt recently made her Met Gala debut, post which her gown’s designer Prabal Gurung shared that he met her through Karan Johar. The actress faced backlash for the same on the internet, and now Karan has taken to his Instagram handle to pen a cryptic note slamming trolls.

Taking to his Instagram stories Karan wrote, “Dear opinion, I know you work 365 days a year ..relentlessly … but my request is for you take Sundays off…Exhaustingly yours, Receiving end.”

Have a look at the post :

Post Alia’s Met Gala appearance, designer Prabal Gurung, in a lengthy Instagram post, revealed that he met Alia for the first time at Karan Johar’s 40th birthday party. “I had heard rave reviews about her through him and my brother Pravesh, who was assisting Karan in her debut film. I was immediately taken by her when I met her. A petite ingénue whose simmering fire within her was palpable to all of us. One film after another, she has surpassed anyone’s expectations and thrilled us with her creative genius. She’s a powerhouse performer. To me, she is one of the finest actors we have right now globally, but above all, she’s a friend, a good friend, and a loyal one; that’s what makes her extremely special.” This post left the netizens divided and one of them even went on to say, “Prabal Gurung’s post on Instagram confirms that KJO is the reason he invited Alia to the Met Gala,” on Reddit.

Here’s the post :

A post shared by Prabal Gurung (@prabalgurung)

Earlier, in the seventh season of Koffee With Karan, the filmmaker shared that despite hate comments and criticism on social media, he ‘has built a thick skin over the years’ and that it doesn’t bother him anymore.” He also clarified that what others say really doesn’t bother him ‘as much as people assume it should.’  He added, ‘Those are the times when I’m like you can say whatever you want about me, my sexuality, or about all the conspiracy theories they have that are really down and dirty. It really doesn’t bother me.’ He also opened up about seeking professional help to deal with his struggles. He revealed that he has been going to therapy for anxiety and that 5 years ago when he was struggling with it, he opened up and spoke to his doctor plainly.

Alia Bhatt made her Bollywood film debut back in 2012 with Karan Johar’s Student Of The Year.

Meanwhile, on the work front, Karan Johar is making his directorial comeback after almost seven years with Rocky Aur Rani Ki Prem Kahani. The film stars Alia Bhatt, Ranveer Singh, Shabana Azmi, Jaya Bachchan and Dharmendra in pivotal roles. The film releasing on July 28, is touted to be an out-and-out family entertainer with romance and comedy. Karan’s last film as a director was Ae Dil Hai Mushkil with Ranbir Kapoor and Anushka Sharma.

The cop who recently stopped musician AR Rahman's concert in Pune has now spoken about it. In a new interview, senior police inspector Santosh Patil said that he just did his job. He also shared that he tried to contact the organisers but since there was no response he had to go on the stage. (Also Read | AR Rahman breaks silence after Pune police stopped his show midway, shares clip of cop on stage)

AR Rahman's show was stopped midway last week as it went past the permissible time of 10 pm. Recently, the musician spoke about the incident. Taking to Twitter, Rahman shared a video in which the cop was seen on the stage. The music composer called it 'a rockstar moment'.

Speaking to Mirror, Santosh said, “I just did my job. I do not want to give any more comments. Anyway, as a police officer, I am not supposed to give interviews to the media. The Supreme Court has set a deadline of 10 pm after which no loud music is allowed to be played.”

He added, ""I tried to contact the organisers but they did not respond. Therefore, I had to go onto the stage and ask Rahman and other performers to stop the music. I had no option as it was past the permissible time.""

On Monday, AR Rahman shared a video from his concert as he performed on stage along with his fellow musicians. While he performed, the cop walked on the stage and pointed at Rahman. This happened while AR Rahman's song Sadda Haq from Rockstar played in the backdrop.

In the video, the words 'thank you Pune for all the love and euphoria' were written. He also wrote on the clip, ""By the way we had a rockstar moment too ;)."" As the video came to an end, AR Rahman addressed the audience and said, ""Okay. I think we overpoured love and we are overboard the time. That's it, we are done. Timing is over. I like this. Thank you city of Pune, the organisers, and the amazing band."" The video ended with the words 'we hope to see you soon' written on it.

Sharing the clip, AR Rahman captioned it, ""Did we all just have the 'Rockstar' moment on stage yesterday? I think we did! We were overwhelmed by the love of the audience and kept wanting to give more...Pune, thank you once again for such a memorable evening. Here’s a little snippet of our roller coaster ride ;).""

Earlier, news agency PTI reported that event organiser, Dr Heramb Shelke, said stopping the show in this manner was disrespectful to Rahman, a composer admired and appreciated the world over, and it could have been done in a ""decent manner"". ""At the last moment, this should not have happened as the entire programme was well organised,"" he had said.

"Pune cop who stopped AR Rahman’s concert speaks out about what happened: ‘I was just doing my job’ | Entertainment News,The Indian Express

The policeman who was caught on camera bringing AR Rahman's Pune concert to a stop has spoken about what transpired that evening.

The policeman who stormed the stage at an AR Rahman concert in Pune and brought it to an abrupt halt has spoken up after the incident. Senior police inspector Santosh Patil was caught on camera walking the length of the stage, and gesturing to Rahman and the performers to stop the concert, on the grounds that they’d exceeded the time allotted to them. “I was just doing my job,” he said.

In an interview with Pune Mirror, the inspector said, “I do not want to give any more comments. Anyway, as a police officer, I am not supposed to give interviews to the media. The Supreme Court has set a deadline of 10 pm after which no loud music is allowed to be played.” He also clarified that he’d tried approaching the organisers first, and that he walked onto the stage only after they didn’t respond. “I tried to contact the organisers but they did not respond. Therefore, I had to go onto the stage and ask Rahman and other performers to stop the music. I had no option as it was past the permissible time,” he said.

After videos of the incident were shared online by concertgoers, Rahman himself took to social media to address what had happened. “Did we all just have the ‘Rockstar’ moment on stage yesterday? I think we did! We were overwhelmed by the love of the audience and kept wanting to give more… Pune, thank you once again for such a memorable evening. Here’s a little snippet of our roller coaster ride;),” he wrote. The video showed glimpses of the concert, and the moment when the cop walked onto the stage and gestured for Rahman to stop. The legendary musician said, “That’s it, we’re done, time’s over. I like this.”

His fans were rather upset about the whole thing, with several people remarking that he shouldn’t have been disrespected in such a manner. Others also praised the grace with which he handled the situation as well as the police officer diligently doing his duty. As he told the crowd that the show would have to end, he thanked the police personnel present at the venue. “Stopping the show like this is not acceptable. It was disrespectful to Padma awardee AR Rahman. There were many ways in which the show could have been stopped. It could have been stopped in a decent manner,” Dr Heramb Shelke, organiser of the event, told Mirror. The show was held at The Mills on Raja Bahadur Mill Road, and was supposed to wrap up by 10 pm."

More than 58 per cent of the electorate cast their votes to decide the fate of 102 candidates from 34 wards, which was seen both as a litmus test and a battle of prestige for the ruling Congress party in Himachal Pradesh and the opposition BJP.

The five-year term of the SMC expired in June 2022 but the elections could not be held due to court cases challenging the delimitation of wards.

In the 2017 elections, the BJP wrested the civic body from the Congress for the first time in 32 years, winning 17 wards. The Congress won from 12 wards, the CPI(M) from one and Independents from four.

Highlights: The Congress bagged a clear majority after winning 24 of 34 wards in the Shimla municipal corporation election. BJP failed to retain its power as it won only 9 seats while the CPIM registered victory over a single seat. 59 per cent voter turnout was registered on Tuesday when the hill state went for polling. The elections to SMC were held after a near year-long delay. The five-year term of the civic body ended in June 2022, but the elections could not be held due to court cases challenging the delimitation of wards. The Congress was upbeat about its chances after victory in the Himachal Pradesh assembly elections in December and relied on its performance over the past five months to get over the line. The BJP, on the other hand, counted on the performance of the outgoing Shimla Municipal Corporation board, which it governed from 2017 to 2022.

"Sanjay Singh's name in excise policy case chargesheet not mistake but deliberate: AAP | Deccan Herald

The Aam Aadmi Party Wednesday alleged the mention of its Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh's name in the Delhi excise policy case chargesheet by ED was a ""deliberate attempt"" to defame the party and its leaders, including Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. Earlier in the day, the party said Singh has written to the Union finance ministry secretary seeking sanction to prosecute

The Aam Aadmi Party Wednesday alleged the mention of its Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh's name in the Delhi excise policy case chargesheet by ED was a ""deliberate attempt"" to defame the party and its leaders, including Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal.

Earlier in the day, the party said Singh has written to the Union finance ministry secretary seeking sanction to prosecute Enforcement Department (ED) Director Sanjay Kumar Mishra and Assistant Director Jogender Singh in connection with allegations made against him in the excise policy case.

ED sources said the name of the AAP leader appears four times in the chargesheet out of which one reference was wrong and typed inadvertently. They said the agency has moved a petition in the court to rectify the anomaly in the prosecution complaint (chargesheet).

Read | AAP MP Sanjay Singh writes to Union Finance Secy, seeks sanction for prosecution of ED Director, Assistant Director

Addressing a press conference, Delhi Cabinet minister and AAP chief spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj alleged that the CBI and ED have become ""synonyms for harassment, fear, torture, threatening and defaming someone"".

""AAP MP Sanjay Singh had announced that he will file a criminal defamation case against two ED officials because they put his name in the chargesheet and later revealed to media that even Sanjay Singh is involved in this concocted scam,"" he said.

Bharadwaj accused the ED of scaring the opposition parties and claimed that they had ""apologised to Sanjay Singh"".

""This is the first time that the ED director had to apologise to someone. In a way, Centre had to apologise to Sanjay Singh and the AAP,"" he said.

Seeking to know how the ""mistake"" could happen, he opined that it was a misfire.

""They said the name was mentioned by mistake. How can this happen? A BJP MP's name didn't come by mistake. It was inserted at the behest of the PMO. This whole alleged scam is fake and the entire case is false.""

Bharadwaj alleged that ""they (Central probe agencies) have not been able to prove corruption worth even a single penny. The whole matter is being done to defame Arvind Kejriwal and his government. It is a conspiracy by the Centre. They want to defame the AAP by hook or crook.""

Alleging that ED has been tasked with a hit job, the AAP spokesperson claimed that the Centre has been exposed.

""Why didn't they put the name of BJP MPs Parvesh Verma or Manoj Tiwari by mistake? This means that the names of Arvind Kejriwal, Sanjay Singh, Manish Sisodia, and Raghav Chadha are in their mind. You are indulging in a conspiracy,"" he alleged and described it as ""shameful"".

Sanjay Singh had on April 22 sent a legal notice to the probe agency asking it to issue an apology, or else face civil and criminal proceedings for allegedly making false and derogatory claims against him in the Delhi excise policy case.

The legal notice, issued by Singh's lawyer, was addressed to ED Director Sanjay Kumar Mishra and Assistant Director Jogender Singh.

ED sources said the probe agency has moved a petition before the designated special PMLA court on April 20 to rectify the anomaly in the prosecution complaint (chargesheet) after the ""typographical/clerical"" came to notice.

An ED counsel wrote to Sanjay Singh's lawyer on April 29 saying that ""instead of Rahul Singh, Sanjay Singh was inadvertently mentioned at only one reference"".

""The said application for correction is much prior to the date of the present notice (Sanjay Singh's notice to the ED on April 22), which demonstrates the bona fide of the agency,"" the ED counsel said.

"‘The Kerala Story’: Skip it or don’t – the film poses no challenge to Kerala’s diverse social fabric | The Indian Express

What are the well-meaning politicians in Kerala afraid of? What is it that a fictitious film will do that the state will have to suffer much?

Written by Anand Mathew

As the razzle and dazzle that accompanied the twin Indian wins at the 95th Academy Awards subsides, the Hindi film industry needs to take a hard look in the mirror. Not surprisingly, it resembles a melange of lost souls, a hustle of bloated egos – all without a plan. Simply put, Bollywood is lost, completely at sea in terms of understanding what content the cinema-going audience wants or how to bring in the much-needed crowds and revenue that can keep them in the run for their next vanity project.

There are also packs keen to pounce on regurgitated themes. In such instances, no attempt is made to pass an idea through a feasibility test, or even run some numbers to gauge its viability. Voila! The so-called “timeliness” of a theme dictates that it be made into a full-blown movie. And thus,The Kerala Story is born. This article, though, will look at it as a “‘Keral’ ka story” to keep in sync with the sensibilities of the product storming theatres this week.

Online activism of a particular kind has enabled the trailer of the film to garner a record number of views within a few days of its release on YouTube, according to its director Sudipto Sen. “Only truth, honesty and commitment” — he tweeted the noble intentions behind the project. However, within a few days of the tweet, the filmmaker’s searing righteousness came into play and a grand number of 32,000 girls who were missing and had, according to the makers of the film, been recruited by ISIS, skydived to merely three. Social media zombies and online rumours may have revealed that 31, 997 of those returned from their respective imaginary flights of fantasy and had landed safely at various ports of their own calling. However, thanks to these spurts of so-called “organic” curiosity among YouTube activists and to the shock and awe of its makers, the film sped past Shah Rukh Khan’s impending release “Jawan” on IMDB to be tagged the most awaited new movie.

With the undue publicity garnered by the film, thanks to vainglorious pronouncements by politicians of all hues, the earlier bleak, soggy financial prospects for the film have now somewhat brightened and hastened the impatience of the makers as they wait breathlessly for its opening day numbers. But pray, what are the well-meaning politicians in Kerala afraid of? What is it that a fictitious film will do that the state will have to suffer much?

That a film “inspired” by the lives of a few women is going to scissor its way, cutting into the taut social, religious, harmonious fabric of the state is an unfounded dread? That a state that nurtures and prides itself on its religious co-existence is going to wither away? Strands of bigotry and religious narcissism continue to test this framework of Kerala’s society, but these remain only attempts. The pragmatism of everyday politics in Kerala necessitates that political parties go the extra mile to ensure that the fruits of development reach all regions and cross sections of the populace irrespective of religion. If the makers of the film had taken the trouble to visit the districts of Kerala, they would have come across large numbers of women in strong leadership positions spread across panchayats and municipalities. To promote a culture of denuding women of their agency and incapable of making informed decisions is a blot not just on women of the state but across the country. Despite simmering fault lines that are being exploited by vested interests, those behind the film have to contend with an inherently resilient social fabric that has sustained across political, social and religious cleavages over many years.

There are so many other stories that define Kerala. The real Kerala story is about the upcoming Malayalam release, 2018 – Everyone is a Hero, directed by Jude Anthany Joseph that is coincidentally opening this week. The film looks at the weave of humanity that came together as one during the “once in a century” floods that hit the state five years back. The real Kerala story was about Arikomban, the rice-loving behemoth of a tusker that was safely captured last week with the help of four other trained captive elephants that increasingly had the state on edge. Sen’s film is just an unreal blip in the steady stream of Bollywood narratives that saunter to a nearby cinema hall every week, watch it if you want or skip it, either choice is a harmless one, and only ours to make.

"Tamil Nadu on high alert ahead of ‘The Kerala Story’ movie release | Latest News India - Hindustan Times

A government official said that reports that the intelligence wing has recommended that the government “must not release The Kerala Story are incorrect” | Latest News India

Tamil Nadu is on high alert ahead of the pan-India release of the controversial film ‘The Kerala Story’ on May 5, officials close to developments said on Wednesday.

“Some groups have called for protests. Our intelligence wing has taken note of their messages on social media,” said a top government official on the condition of anonymity.

“Some Islamic groups have also approached the police in a few districts seeking a ban. But the government is not banning it. Even Kerala has not banned it. We have, however, relayed the alerts to all the law enforcement agencies to remain on high alert,” the official added.

The official also confirmed that reports that the intelligence wing has recommended that the government “must not release The Kerala Story are incorrect”.

“The Intelligence officers have not given us any such recommendation, and the government has not taken any decision on it,” the official said.

The Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to entertain pleas for stalling the release of The Kerala Story and directed the petitioners to approach the Kerala high court, where similar petitions are pending.

The Muslim clerical body Jamiat Ulama-I-Hind approached the top court after the film’s trailer was released.

The petitioners have said that the film demeans the entire community and will endanger the lives and livelihood of Muslims. Besides seeking a stay on the movie’s release, the petition sought a disclaimer stating that the film is a work of fiction and its characters bear no resemblance to any person living or dead.

“The movie begins by flashing a note that it has been inspired by true events.... it is falsely stated that 32,000 girls have left Kerala for West Asia to join ISIS even though the United Nations, the Union Home Ministry, police sources, and experts agree that the number of Indians who left to join ISIS is around 66 and the maximum number of pro-ISIS persons who may have shown inclination towards ISIS is in between 100 and 200,” the petition said.

Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan accused the “Sangh Parivar” and the makers of the film of “sowing the poisonous seeds of communalism” describing the film as propaganda.

Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Monday offered ₹1 crore to anyone who can prove that 32,000 women in Kerala were forced to convert to Islam. National award-winning cinematographer P C Sreeram from Tamil Nadu tweeted on Wednesday, “What is this “The Kerala story” Is it the same as the famous obscene propaganda film “Kashmir files”?”

"Ban on 'The Kerala Story' not practical, govt calls for boycott | Kerala News

The government has been decided to go ahead with a campaign to boycott the film..The Kerala Story. Kerala Story ban. Boycott Kerala Story. Left government. LDF

Hello

Thiruvananthapuram: The Kerala government has called for a boycott of the controversial film 'The Kerala Story' since a ban on the screening is impractical.

The government has been decided to go ahead with a campaign to boycott the film.

Though the Department of Cultural Affairs had planned to seek legal advice to explore the possibility of a ban, the state government decided against it.

There are two reasons for the same. One, the petition against the film was not accepted by the Supreme Court. Two, it is not clear if the State can ban a film cleared by the Censor Board.

Several Left leaders including CPM General Secretary Sitaram Yechury is also of the opinion that a ban would be more effective.

Meanwhile, Kerala Catholic Bishops' Council (KCBC) and United Democratic Front (UDF) has demanded a ban on the play 'Kakkukali'. Minister of Cultural Affairs Saji Cherian has said that works of art that harm religious sentiments cannot be allowed in the name of freedom of expression. The Minister stated the other day that further action will be taken after an expert committee examines the issue. The committee will be formed soon.

"Opinion | ‘The Kerala Story’ is Just a Movie, The Love Jihad Rot Goes Deeper

As the saying goes, ‘The solution of a problem begins with its acknowledgement.’ Indians must recognise the love jihad menace and stand together against this socio-political issue

Written By:  Yuvraj Pokharna

New Delhi, India

The plot of The Kerala Story reveals how women who are goaded into conversion to Islam join ISIS for jihad.

The plot of The Kerala Story — produced by Vipul Shah and directed by Sudipto Sen — reveals how women who are goaded into (forced) conversion to Islam join ISIS for jihad. It also intrepidly claimed that 32,000 Hindu and Christian women in the state were turned into Muslims and recruited into terrorist outfits.

The trailer has fomented a high-pitched national altercation. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has added fuel to the fire by calling the film “communal polarisation”. He also drew the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) into the fray, accusing the film of spreading the RSS’ goal in Kerala. The state culture minister, Saji Cherian, urged people to boycott the movie, alleging that the state is portrayed in a bad light.

As reported in an article, “The release of this movie in Kerala has been opposed by political parties like the Left Democratic Front (LDF), which is currently in power, the United Democratic Front (UDF), which is in Opposition, and their respective youth organisations. The Kerala Congress has also voiced opposition to the movie, claiming that it shows Islam in a bad light. Now, the Muslim Youth League general secretary has also objected to the film and called it a propaganda film endorsed by the ‘Sangh Parivar,’ and that a case should be filed against director Sudipto Sen.”

Muslim rule was already a spent force by the time Aurangzeb died in 1707. Also, most Islamic monarchs were preoccupied with consolidating power, dealing with internal revolts and coups, or dealing with intense opposition from Hindu kings, in particular, and the Hindu public in general. So, when did they have the time and resources to convert a multitude of Hindus in the midst of all this chaos? Perhaps it is true that during Islamic control, many Hindu elites were persuaded to join Islam in order to keep their positions of power and privilege by knowing our culture and demographics, allowing them to steal with minimal collateral damage. But that was all on their own volition.

Similarly, some generations of Hindu court musicians were allowed to continue performing on the condition that they converted to Islam. However, the profuse majority of Hindus endured during these testing times, without yielding to the Islamic atrocities, which lasted just a few hundred years in the timeline of Bharat that dates back to at least tens of thousands of years. One needs to ruminate on what happened to the children of Hindu mothers abducted by invading Muslims. What about the offspring of thousands of Hindu women held in harems by sultans, emperors, army generals, and ministers?

Hizb ut-Tahrir: Is New Terror Module Unearthed in Madhya Pradesh a PFI Clone? SIT Formed to Probe Case

Opinion | If ‘The Kerala Story’ Was a Work of Pure ‘Fiction’, Liberal-Secular-Islamists Won’t Have Felt So Insecure

These kids were born to Hindu mothers but raised as Muslims. Amir Khusro was born to an Uzbek Muslim father and a Hindu Rajput mother. His children were brought up in a Muslim household. Jodhabai, a Rajput Hindu princess, was Jahangir’s mother. As a pious Muslim, Jahangir controlled India and helped spread Islam throughout the country.

Invaders would have required copious armies with crores of men to convert these Hindus! The invaders lacked the time and resources to do this, and also the motivation and desire to do it. They had just come here to rob, plunder, abduct women, and enjoy power. For example, Salar Masud, the nephew of Mahmud of Ghazni, could assemble an army of Turks, Persians, and Afghans just on the promise of looting and plundering Ayodhya. He persuaded them by saying that Ayodhya was far larger and wealthier than Somnath, which had been devastated by his maternal uncle. Masud and his army were defeated by King Suheldev in the famous battle of Bahraich in present-day UP in the year 1023; Masud too was killed.

As a result, it is clear that our Hindu forefathers did not cave in and convert to Islam as freely as projected to be the case. So, how can we account for the large number of Muslims in modern India? Why are there so few Hindus (of all religions) in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Bangladesh?

Hindu girls are wilfully picked by Muslim men—lately under the pretence of a fake Hindu identity—and seduced under the disguise of love, to convert to Islam. That is tantamount to jihad, as in Islam, marrying a kafir is forbidden; she must first convert to Islam before marriage. But this “stealth-war” jihad is as old as Islam itself. It is the most powerful instrument ever used to convert kafirs, or infidels, to Islam. Mind it, this love jihad was not invented by today’s “communal” Hindus or the RSS, as phony liberal intellectuals allege.

The Christian Church invented the name “love jihad” after observing a huge number of young Christian females being seduced by Muslim men in Kerala, although it has been perpetuated for thousands of years. On December 9, 2009, in Shahan Sha A vs. the State of Kerala, the Kerala High Court had directed the state government to provide information on love jihad, observing that there was a movement or project called “Love Jihad” or “Romeo Jihad” conceived by a section of Muslims in Kerala to convert girls from other religions to Islam. Justice KT Sankaran had found indications of ‘forceful’ religious conversions under the garb of ‘love’ in the state and asked the government to consider enacting a law to prohibit such ‘deceptive’ acts. “Under the pretext of love, there cannot be any compulsive, deceptive conversion,” he said. In one of his interviews from 2010, former Kerala CM and CPI (M) veteran VS Achuthanandan said, “They (the ruling party) want to turn Kerala into a Muslim-majority state in 20 years. They are using money and other inducements to convert people to Islam. They even marry women from outside their community in order to increase the Muslim population.” He further added, “The Muslim youth were also inveigled to marry Hindu girls.”

Now let us return to present-day conditions. A little while ago, a WhatsApp message goading Muslim youth to entice and marry Hindu women went viral, which was then exposed by social media. The message read, “If a Muslim youth marries a Hindu Brahmin girl, he would be awarded with Rs 5 lakh; similarly if someone gets hitched to a Sikh Punjabi girl, he would be given Rs 7 lakh,” the notorious WhatsApp message said. “If the girl is from the Kshatriya Hindu community, the cash reward would be Rs 4.5 lakh, a Gujarat Brahmin girl Rs 6 lakh, a Punjabi Hindu Rs 6 lakh, a Christian Roman Catholic Rs 4 lakh, a Christian Protestant Rs 3 lakh, a Jain Rs 3 lakh, and a Gujarati Kutch girl Rs 3 lakh.”

This is true for millions upon millions of Hindu women who were coerced or lured into marrying a Muslim. The outcomes are consistent. This love jihad is not limited to India. It is now taking place throughout Europe and Northern America, taking full advantage of these continents’ democratic and liberal administrations.

To combat this scourge known as “love jihad,"" the world must unite and follow a long-term approach in tandem:

As the saying goes, “The solution of a problem begins with its acknowledgement.” The Indians must stand together against this socio-political malice.

"FIR served purpose of plea: Supreme Court asks wrestlers to approach lower courts - India Today

The Supreme Court closed the proceedings on a plea filed by women wrestlers against the WFI chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh. The wrestlers had been demanding the ongoing investigation be monitored by a retired or a serving high court judge.

By Kanu Sarda, Aneesha Mathur: The Supreme Court on Thursday closed the proceedings on a plea filed by women wrestlers against Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh and asked the protesting grapplers to approach a lower court.

A bench headed by the Chief Justice of India, DY Chandrachud, noted that the petition was filed seeking an FIR and granted liberty to the petitioners to approach the jurisdictional magistrate or the Delhi High Court for any further grievances.

During the hearing, senior advocate Narender Hooda requested the bench to monitor the investigation as the conduct of the Delhi Police in refusing to take action till the Supreme Court's intervention is questionable.

""We have only said that we are closing the proceedings at this stage, confining ourselves to the prayers. We have not said that this is not worthy of being monitored. You can approach the Magistrate or the Delhi High Court if there are any issues,"" the CJI said.

The bench also noted in the order that the Delhi Police have recorded the minor's statement on April 29 and the statements of four others on May 3 and that the police are taking steps to record statements before a magistrate under Section 164 of the CrPC.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Delhi Police, told the bench that security arrangements have been made for the minor complainant as per the directions of the court and security has also been provided for six other girls at Jantar Mantar.

Senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing on behalf of Brij Bhushan, told the bench that personal allegations have been made against him without making him a party in the case.

On the bench's query on recording of the statement, the Solicitor General said, ""Investigation in this case was done by a senior lady officer and we are doing our best neutrally.""

To this, senior advocate Narender Hooda told the bench that the seven complainants approached the Delhi Police with their complaints on April 21. But no FIR was immediately registered, and they had to knock on the doors of the Supreme Court. Finally, the FIRs were lodged only on April 28.

""So far as the accused is concerned, he has become a TV star. Every day he gives interviews to TV channels. He is taking the names of the complainants, he is naming their akharas. The accused said that he has not been approached by the police so far. Last time, this court said that the identity of the complainants must not be disclosed, but the accused is taking names,"" Hooda further said.

Objecting to the submissions, Salve said, ""Complainants are themselves sitting in protest.""

Hooda then referred to the scuffle between the Delhi Police and the wrestlers last night.

Responding to this, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said two political leaders of a particular party went there with beds, which the police sought to stop, and this led to a scuffle. He clarified that the theory that the police were drunk is incorrect as the medical tests showed nothing.WHY ARE WRESTLERS PROTESTING?

The second phase of protests by wrestlers began on April 23 at Delhi's Jantar Mantar. They have accused the WFI chief Brij Bhushan Singh of sexual assault allegations, including that of a minor wrestler.WHAT WFI CHIEF SAID

Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh has denied all charges against him, claiming these protests were politically motivated.

In fact, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh has said that he has got proof to show that protests by wrestlers were part of a ""conspiracy"" hatched by the Congress and wrestler Bajrang Punia. He said that his mere resignation was not what these protestors had been seeking.POLICE ACTION

The Delhi Police has filed two FIRs against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh after the Supreme Court intervened. “The first FIR has been registered under the POCSO Act along with relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). It was filed based on the allegations of a minor. The second FIR was registered for a comprehensive investigation into the complaints by other complainants under relevant sections pertaining to outraging of modesty,” the Delhi Police said in a statement.

"Wrestlers Protest, Jantar Mantar: Delhi Police Counters Wrestlers' 'Attack By Drunk Cops' Charge: 10 Facts

Wrestlers protesting at Delhi's Jantar Mantar have alleged that they were manhandled by drunk policemen late Wednesday night. The wrestlers claim that they were assaulted by cops when they wanted to bring in folding beds to the protest site.

Wrestlers Protest at Jantar Mantar: wrestlers have accused Delhi Police of manhandling.

Several wrestlers were hit on the head with two sustaining injuries. One person fell unconscious and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment.

According to the police, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Somnath Bharti reached the protest site with folding beds without permission. When the police intervened, a minor altercation broke out following which the AAP leader and two others were detained, police said.

In a video that is now viral on social media, some protesters can be heard accusing police personnel of attacking wrestlers under the influence of alcohol.

""A drunk policeman, Dharemendra, abused Vinesh Phogat and got involved in a scuffle with us,"" said former wrestler Rajveer. Olympian and Commonwealth Games Gold medallist Geeta Phogat has said that her younger brother Dushyant Phogat's head ""was cracked open"".

Asian and Commonwealth Games gold medallist Vinesh Phogat broke down and said they were not criminals to be treated in such manner. ""If you want to kill us, then kill us,"" Ms Phogat said crying. Olympics bronze medallist Bajrang Punia, speaking with NDTV, said, ""I request the government that it take back all the medals I have won.""

Delhi Police have dismissed allegations of some policemen being drunk. The police said that no force was used against the protesters and that five police personnel sustained injuries in the altercation.

Following the clash, heavy police force has been deployed at the protest site and the whole area has been barricaded, not allowing media personnel to reach the protesting wrestlers.

Congress leader Deepender Singh Hooda who reached the protest site late at night claimed that he was detained by Delhi Police and taken to Vasant Vihar police station.

India's top wrestlers are protesting against the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief and BJP MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh over sexual harassment allegations. The six-time MP has denied all allegations leveled against him.

The Supreme Court today closed proceedings on the petition filed by three women wrestlers who have levelled sexual harassment allegations against Mr Singh. The court noted that FIRs have been registered and seven of the complainants have been provided adequate security.

"For Bajrang Dal, a PM's Chant. For Bajrang Punia, a Midnight Police Assault

The PM's defence of Bajrang Dal in the wake of Congress’s promise to ban the hardline Hindutva organisation is in sharp contrast to his silence on Olympic medalist Bajrang Purnia’s appeals to seek justice for his colleagues who have been allegedly harassed by the PM's party MP.

Bengaluru: The Delhi police’s midnight manhandling of protesting wrestlers at Jantar Mantar is the latest instance of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Union government’s inclination to crush any form of dissent.

Not many would have thought that even internationally-reputed Indian wrestlers and Olympic medalists like Sakshi Malik and Bajrang Punia will be treated with the same apathy as most other groups who have had reason to protest in the recent past.

The wrestlers have been demanding punishment for alleged sexual offenders in the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI). They claim that the WFI president and BJP MP Brij Bhushan Singh and some coaches have sexually harassed multiple female athletes. For similar accusations against M.J. Akbar, the Union government had swiftly removed the former Union minister. But it has been largely muted in its response to the wrestlers’ protest.

Singh is an extremely powerful and resourceful MP from Uttar Pradesh, and has never hidden his strongman image. He is rumoured to have a direct or indirect role in several crimes, including murders. Even while dismissing such accusations, Singh himself admitted to have committed “only one murder.” He is said to have great influence in over a dozen assembly seats in UP’s Gonda, which is why the BJP is reluctant in letting him go.

The assault on wrestlers on the night of May 3, 2023 is a culmination of many moves already made by the government and its BJP supporters to malign and invalidate the serious charges that the wrestlers have been making against the governing members of the WFI. First, the Union sports minister Anurag Singh Thakur claimed that he had already met the protesting wrestlers for over 12 hours and heard their accusations. However, the wrestlers denied having ever met Thakur, alleging that many requests made to the ministers went unheard.

देश का मान बढ़ाने वाली बेटियाँ आधी रात को सड़क पर रो रही हैं और यौन उत्पीड़न का आरोपी अपने घर में मज़े से सो रहा है क्योंकि वो बीजेपी का नेता है।

वैसे, 'यत्र नार्यस्तु पूज्यन्ते, रमन्ते तत्र देवताः' – यह श्लोक हमारे @narendramodi जी का फेवरेट श्लोक है और उन्हें कंठस्थ है। pic.twitter.com/Q9BJR7bSNL

— Bhagat Ram (@bhagatram2020) May 3, 2023

Singh, on the other hand, accused the wrestlers of conspiring against him at the behest of “a politician and an industrialist”.

At the same time, the BJP and compliant media have only complemented each other in efforts to protect Singh by equating the wrestlers’s protests over sexual harassment allegations with those who it could easily berate as the “tukde tukde gang” or “anti-India”.

Now, following the assault on wrestlers by alleged non-uniformed “drunk” policemen, the government has transformed the site of their protest into a fortress guarded by more policemen. The heavy barricading of the protest site reeks of the criminal treatment that the government has meted out to the Indian wrestlers.

The chain of events around the wrestlers’s agitation only highlights the fact that the Union government may have set a template to deal with all forms of dissent. The justness of the cause simply does not matter to the powers that be, who have shown their incapability to understand any concern outside their own electoral interests.

The year-long farmers’s movement on the borders of Delhi was treated in a similar way.

Firstly, the government and their supporters berated the protesting farmers as stooges of “Khalistani separatists”. The BJP supporters dismissed the agitation as sponsored by rich farmers and criminals when clearly all sections of the farming community were participating in it. The tags of “tukde tukde gang” and “anti-national” were slapped on them from the first day the farmers began agitating. The government officials and ministers engaged with them in multiple rounds of talks but only to hammer down the point that the farming laws could not be revoked. Even when the government was forced to revoke the laws, it has reneged on its promise of legalising the Minimum Support Prices (MSP) system.

Like last night when the wrestlers were faced with police attacking them late in the night, the protesting farmers saw multiple assaults on them at the protest sites late in the night. The barricading of the Jantar Mantar amidst heavy police deployment reminds one of the Delhi police’s attempt to stop the marching farmers by erecting nails and barbed wires on roads and constructing cement walls.

The course of events during the anti-CAA protests were similar.

Castigating the peaceful Muslim protestors down by equating them with “terrorists”, booking many supporters of the movement in conspiracy and UAPA charges, lathi-charging university students and other protestors across the country, creating riot-like conditions through fringe rightwing organisations, ministers deriding the protests that swore on constitutional nationalism with hateful Islamophobhic statements – all happened before the protest sites were uprooted by forces in a joint action by Delhi police and Hindutva organisations.

The more things change, the more they stay the same. The BJP-led government has only proven the old adage to be true in all its aspects.

While the protesting wrestler and Olympic medalist Bajrang Punia, who is agitating in support of his female colleagues, is being reprimanded with the use of sheer force, the Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP has been defending the violent Bajrang Dal in Karnataka’s electoral ground. The Congress’s decision to equate Bajrang Dal and the Popular Front of India while promising to ban fundamentalist organisations has been projected by the saffron forces as an affront to Hindu faith.

Most Karnataka residents are familiar with Bajrang Dal’s tendency to stir up religious controversies where there are none. Most of them also know about the organisation’s proclivity for violence while whipping up hate campaigns against Muslims. But that perhaps doesn’t bother the Prime Minister as he has not only defended Bajrang Dal but has also asked voters to chant “Jai Bajrang Bali” before voting. In all his rallies over the last two days, he has attacked the Congress for allegedly denigrating Lord Hanuman by promising to ban Bajrang Dal.

Modi doesn’t mind stirring up polarising sentiments if they entail political benefits to his party. In Karnataka, his last-mile push has been that of hardline Hindutva, alienating Muslims further from the mainstream, and using Bajrang Dal as a prop to consolidate Hindus along religious lines.

Should the PFI now say that the central ban on the organisation was an attack on Islam? BJP’s logic was tersely summed by senior journalist Neena Vyas. “Does the PM know Ram naam is not the same as Ram Sena, Bajrangbali not equal to Bajrang Dal? The latter, the Dal, has repeatedly shown itself to be above law…When BJP split the Shiv Sena was it insulting Lord Shiva?” she tweeted.

The government’s response to both Bajrang Dal and Bajrang Punia has been a tale of opposites. One Bajrang has shamed the government for inaction against an alleged sexual offender, and was, therefore, dealt with a heavy hand, with a complete lack of humanism. The other Bajrang that has frequently seen itself as above law is empowered and encouraged to act with further impunity by none other than the Prime Minister.

The hollowness of BJP’s slogan “sabka saath, sabka vikaas” shows through the two episodes. They also prove that the government has different yardsticks for different people. As long as violent organisations like Bajrang Dal advance BJP’s political and ideological interests, they can be accorded a position above law and a place above criticism. But those asking for justice will be nipped in the bud. It doesn’t matter that those seeking justice could be Olympic medalists who brought glory to the nation."
"3 reasons why Rahul Tewatia can be the finisher India requires in T20Is

Rahul Tewatia's emergence as a T20 finisher has already become folklore in the annals of IPL cricket.

Rahul Tewatia's emergence as a T20 finisher has already become folklore in the annals of IPL cricket. But is it time for the 'Iceman' to get drafted into the Indian T20 side? He has certainly done his reputation no harm in the ongoing IPL season with some blistering knocks.

Coming into bat in a crunch situation against the Delhi Capitals on Tuesday, Tewatia struck three consecutive sixes in the penultimate over against Anrich Nortje. This brought the equation down to 12 required off the final over.

He couldn’t quite get his side over the line, losing his wicket to Ishant Sharma in the final over. Still, he made a big impression with this striking ability.

Tewatia has already done great things in his IPL career. This includes winning a match for the Titans last season by smashing Odean Smith for two consecutive sixes with 12 required off the last two balls.

With many players being given the opportunity to perform at the international level in the shortest format, Tewatia could well make his international debut soon. If he succeeds at the highest level, he could be a part of the Indian team for the T20 World Cup next year.

With that in mind, let's take a look at three reasons why Rahul Tewatia could be the finisher India requires in T20Is.

Rahul Tewatia’s sample size of matches might not be huge, but he has done enough to be called 'The Iceman'.

He has been a wonderboy in the IPL over the last few seasons and calmness under immense pressure has been the hallmark of his batting in the death overs.

Tewatia has found himself in crunch situations quite often, especially in the last two years, and has come out trumps with his uncanny knack of finding the boundary.

The 29-year-old is hugely confident in his ability just like a certain MS Dhoni, who is arguably the greatest white ball finisher the game has seen.

Rahul Tewatia always backs his ability and finds a way to come out on top during the death overs. In the match against DC, he found a way to make Nortje bowl to his strengths and smashed him for three sixes.

He loves using the depth of the crease and also has the ability to play square of the wicket, as well as behind the wicket. He knows his limitations and hardly plays cheeky dabs and glides but rather, relies on his muscular strength.

The impact that Rahul Tewatia has had in the last few years has been nothing short of phenomenal. He has the incredible ability to make tough situations look manageable and win games from hopeless positions.

Despite not having a huge range of shots in his repertoire, Tewatia has the ability to hit sixes at will. He came into the limelight in 2020 when he smashed five sixes in a Sheldon Cottrell over.

After struggling in the initial stages of his innings, Tewatia turned on the heat in the last three overs, leading RR to a record run chase.

But an international call-up is yet to materialize. India is desperately looking for a proven finisher in the T20 format and Tewatia has all the ingredients to become a successful finisher for Men in Blue in the coming years.

"""Petrol Khatam Ho Chuka Tha"": Mohammed Shami's Hilarious Take On 4-For Against Delhi Capitals | Cricket News

With his impressive performance, Mohammed Shami bagged the Man of the Match award but it wasn't enough to seal the game for the title defenders.

Gujarat Titans (GT) ace bowler Mohammed Shami displayed sensational form with the ball as he picked up 4 wickets giving away only 11 runs in the process against Delhi Capitals (DC). During the mid-innings break when he was asked if he wanted to bowl more, Shami came up with a witty reply. ""Nahi nahi, petrol khatam ho chuka tha (I have given it my all and bowled four on the trot),"" said Shami after becoming the Purple Cap holder.With his impressive performance, Shami bagged the Man of the Match award but it wasn't enough to seal the game for the title defenders.GT had the worst possible start while chasing 131 as they ended up losing three crucial wickets of Wriddhiman Saha, Shubman Gill and Vijay Shankar in the powerplay. Skipper Hardik Pandya tried to pull GT back into the game but it wasn't enough as they kept losing wickets at the other end at regular intervals.""I felt we should have chased this. The mistake was losing wickets at regular intervals, we needed partnerships and they came too late for us. However, plenty of games left. Such things happen,"" Shami said after the match.Chasing 131, Gujarat Titans were dealt with an early blow as Wriddhiman Saha was caught behind off Khaleel who bowled a fantastic wicket maiden. Khaleel beat Saha's outside edge multiple times before finally getting him to edge one to the keeper via terrific swing bowling.AdvertisementHardik Pandya went on the counter-attack in the third over from Khaleel, thumping three fours but GT found themselves two down in the next over as Anrich Nortje had Gill (6 off 7) caught at covers off an uppish drive. Ishant Sharma then produced a beautiful knuckleball to the castle in-form Vijay Shankar and reduce GT to 26/3.GT stuttered to 31/3 at the end of the Powerplay. Kuldeep Yadav came into the attack and didn't take time to strike as he cleaned up David Miller (0 off 3) who shuffled across for a sweep but missed it completely.Pandya and Abhinav Manohar started the rebuilding process but DC kept things largely tight as the required run rate crept over 10 per over with five overs to go. Hardik brought up the 50-run stand with a powerful pull for a four off Nortje. The skipper then brought up his half-century off 44 balls. Kuldeep bowled another excellent over, giving just five to complete an excellent spell of 4-0-15-1.With 37 needed off 18, Khaleel returned and struck with the first ball to remove Manohar (26 off 33), who was caught at long-on. Khaleel completed an excellent over to give away just four as the equation read 33 needed off 12 balls.AdvertisementNortje started off the penultimate over well, nailing his yorkers and giving away just three off the first three balls. But he missed his marker as Rahul Tewatia came into his own to swing the next three balls for three sixes in a row to bring the equation down to 12 needed off the last over.Warner handed the ball to Ishant for the final over and the experienced veteran answered his captain's call with a fantastic over.Ishant started off brilliantly and gave away just three off the first three balls and then got Tewatia (20 off 7), caught at extra cover as the equation came to 9 needed of 2 balls. Rashid Khan smashed the next one to cover the point where Rossouw stopped it.Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.comWith 7 needed off the last ball, Ishant bowled a full toss which Rashid sliced over backward point for just two as the DC players erupted in wild celebrations.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)Comments Topics mentioned in this article Gujarat Titans  Delhi Capitals  Mohammad Shami IPL 2023 CricketGet the latest updates on IPL 2023 and check out  IPL Schedule and Live Cricket Score. Like us on Facebook or follow us on Twitter for more sports updates.

"I tried my best but could not capitalise: Hardik Pandya | Cricbuzz.com

The Titans skipper scored an unbeaten half-century but couldn't land the finishing punches on Delhi Capitals in a modest chase

Search for “”

Gujarat Titans skipper Hardik Pandya took full responsibility for his side's unexpected five-run defeat to Delhi Capitals on Tuesday (May 2) in Ahmedabad. Chasing an under-par total of 130, the Titans' chase was anchored by Hardik who was unusually sedate in his half-century knock and was unable to put the finishing touches as he had expected to.

""I tried my best but could not capitalise. It boils down to me,"" Hardik said at the post-match presentation. ""Obviously, we would have taken 129 [131-run target] on any given day. [We] just lost a couple of wickets and at the end, Rahul got us back in the game.""

Unlike their usual chasing trend, Gujarat were rocked early in their innings, losing four wickets inside the seven-over mark, including the pivotal ones of Shubman Gill and David Miller. It meant that Hardik, alongside young Abhinav Manohar had to soak in the pressure with a partnership that was more about stabilising the innings than motoring along.

Hardik's pacing of his innings was similar to the tempo he had during the afternoon game against Lucknow Super Giants, except that he was able to hit a few maximums at the backend in that game - something that he wasn't able to manage this time around. In fact, the all-rounder couldn't find the fence in the last 13 balls of his innings at a phase when the asking rate had shot up drastically.

""We were hoping to get a couple of big overs in the middle but at that point of time we could not get rhythm,"" he said. ""It was new for Abhinav as well. It boils down to how I was not able to finish the game. Full marks to their bowlers as well and full ownership on my side where I could not finish the game I should've.""

Prior to this game, the matches in Ahmedabad had produced reasonably high-scoring games that were also chased down successfully. Batters generally enjoyed striking the ball and there were also a lot of boundaries hit in those games. They were a stark contrast to this fixture that saw just nine sixes across the two innings. Hardik, though, didn't feel the surface was all that tricky to bat on.

""It was more about the pressure of [losing] wickets,"" he said. ""I don't think the [track] played much role. It was a tad slower than what we are used to here. But they bowled really well. We lost a couple of early wickets and then we had to take some time. We could not get the rhythm in the middle. Rahul brought us back into the game. Otherwise, they were quite ahead.""

Since Miller's exit in the seventh over, only one boundary (a six) was hit until the 14th over and it's during this phase that the DC bowlers tightened the screws. Titans' mantra while chasing has always been to take the game deep, relying on the power game of their finishers to get them across the line. Statistically, it had been a largely proven method, except that it didn't work in this contest.

""Intent had to be there. It's just that we lost a couple of wickets where if you keep losing wickets, it's difficult to keep the intent as well. We lost because I could not get my rhythm and we kept losing wickets at the start and that put us under pressure. We like to take it deep and hope to get a couple of big overs which we could not get.""

The game had been set up nicely for the Titans by their bowlers, led by an impeccable spell from Mohammed Shami. The senior pacer bowled an unchanged new-ball spell that saw him pick up four scalps through accurate lines and sharp seam movement. Hardik was all praise for his pace spearhead and regretted his side's inability to capitalise on the excellent bowling effort.

""I feel sorry for [Shami],"" Hardik said. ""If you bowl like that, then you restrict the team to 129 [130], I think [our] batters disappointed. I don't think the ball did a lot. It's just that Mohammed Shami's skillset he has and he made the ball talk. Otherwise, I think for fast bowlers, the wicket did not have much assistance. But the way he bowled four on the trot and got us in the game, full credit [to him].

""As I said, batters and particularly myself did not finish and we disappointed him.""

The defeat was Gujarat's first of the season in a run chase and only the second time overall from 14 games. The defending champions next go to Jaipur to take on the Rajasthan Royals on Friday (May 5)."

      "\n",
      "There are a few reasons to think that President Biden might lose his bid for re-election next year, even if Donald Trump is once more — for the third straight time — the Republican nominee.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s the Electoral College, which could still favor the Republican Party just enough to give Trump 270 electoral votes, even if he doesn’t win a popular majority. There’s Biden’s overall standing — around 43 percent of Americans approve of his job performance — which doesn’t compare favorably with past incumbents who did win re-election. There’s the economy, which may hit a downturn between now and next November. And even if it doesn’t, Biden will still have presided over the highest inflation rate since the 1980s. Last, there’s Biden himself. The oldest person ever elected president, next year he will be — at 81 — the oldest president to ever stand for re-election. Biden’s age is a real risk that could suddenly become a liability.\n",
      "\n",
      "If Biden has potential weaknesses, however, it is also true that he doesn’t lack for real advantages. Along with low unemployment, there’s been meaningful economic growth, and he can point to significant legislative accomplishments. The Democratic Party is behind him; he has no serious rivals for the nomination.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Biden’s biggest advantage has to do with the opposition — the Republican Party has gotten weird. It’s not just that Republican policies are well outside the mainstream, but that the party itself has tipped over into something very strange.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had this thought while watching a clip of Ron DeSantis speak from a lectern to an audience we can’t see. In the video, which his press team highlighted on Twitter, DeSantis decries the “woke mind virus,” which he calls “a form of cultural Marxism that tries to divide us based on identity politics.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I can follow this as a professional internet user and political observer. I know that “woke mind virus” is a term of art for the (condescending and misguided) idea that progressive views on race and gender are an outside contagion threatening the minds of young people who might otherwise reject structural explanations of racial inequality and embrace a traditional vision of the gender binary. I know that “cultural Marxism” is a right-wing buzzword meant to sound scary and imposing.\n",
      "\n",
      "To a normal person, on the other hand, this language is borderline unintelligible. It doesn’t tell you anything; it doesn’t obviously mean anything; and it’s quite likely to be far afield of your interests and concerns.\n",
      "\n",
      "DeSantis is a regular offender when it comes to speaking in the jargon of culture war-obsessed conservatives, but he’s not the only one. And it’s not just a problem of jargon. Republican politicians — from presidential contenders to anonymous state legislators — are monomaniacally focused on banning books, fighting “wokeness” and harassing transgender people. Some Republicans are even still denying the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election, doubling down on the election-related conspiracies that hobbled many Republican candidates in the midterms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not only do Americans not care about the various Republican obsessions — in a recent Fox News poll 1 percent of respondents said “wokeness” was “the most important issue facing the country today” — but a large majority say that those obsessions have gone too far. According to Fox, 60 percent of Americans said “book banning by school boards” was a major problem. Fifty-seven percent said the same for political attacks on families with transgender children.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not for nothing that in Biden’s first TV ad of the 2024 campaign, he took specific aim at conservative book bans as a threat to freedom and American democracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yet there’s no sign that Republicans will relent and shift focus. Just the opposite, in fact; the party is poised to lurch even farther down the road of its alienating preoccupations. On abortion, for example, Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, says candidates need to address the issue “head-on” in 2024 — that they can’t be “uncomfortable” on the issue and need to say “I’m proud to be pro-life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Republican Party has veered quite far from most Americans on abortion rights, and in a contested race for the presidential nomination, a “head-on” focus will possibly mean a fight over which candidate can claim the most draconian abortion views and policy aims.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s more: DeSantis is in the midst of a legal battle with Disney, one of the most beloved companies on the planet, and House Republicans are threatening the global economy in order to pass a set of deeply unpopular spending cuts to widely used assistance programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taken together, it’s as if the Republican Party has committed itself to being as off-putting as possible to as many Americans as possible. That doesn’t mean the party is doomed, of course. But as of this moment, it is hard to say it’s on the road to political success.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for Joe Biden? The current state of the Republican Party only strengthens his most important political asset — his normalcy. He promised, in 2020, that he would be a normal president. And he is promising, for 2024, to continue to serve as a normal president. Normal isn’t fun and normal isn’t exciting. But normal has already won one election, and I won’t be surprised if it wins another.\n",

      "After years of solo hits and an ongoing stint fronting classic rock powerhouse Queen, Lambert was back on familiar ground on Sunday night (April 30) when he returned to the Idol stage for a rocking cover of the 1973 Anne Peebles hit “I Can’t Stand the Rain.” The slow-burn ballad — famously covered by Tina Turner in 1984 on her Private Dancer album — got a electric reboot in the singer’s hands thanks to a set that surrounded him with digital purple rain showers.\n",
      "\n",
      "With blue makeup tears dripping from his eyes and a typically understated all-leather ensemble spiked with sparkle accents, fingerless gloves, black platform books and a mesh tank top, Lambert bumped and grinded his way through the song, hitting all the high notes you’d expect and adding his patented glam magic to the R&&B burner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lambert dropped by just in time to meet this year’s Idol top 10, which was revealed on Sunday night. The singes vying for this year’s title are: Wé Ani, Marybeth Byrd, Megan Danielle, Haven Madison, Warren Peay, Zachariah Smith, Oliver Steele, Colin Stough and Iam Tongi.\n",
      "\n",
      "The latter has been on a serious roll this season, earning hugs and bringing tears to the judges’ eyes with his gritty story and soulful vocals, including on Sunday night when Tongi ditched his guitar for a moving cover of Sam Cooke’s “Bring It On Home to Me.”\n",

      "\n",
      "Paul Stanley of Kiss has made a statement criticizing parents who support kids' gender identities, calling it a “a sad and dangerous fad.”\n",
      "\n",
      "By \n",
      "\n",
      "\tAlthea Legaspi\n",
      "\n",
      "Kiss member Paul  Stanley has — for some reason — made a statement on Twitter about his stance on kids’ gender identities and the parents who are “normalizing and even encouraging participation” in embracing them, calling it a “sad and dangerous fad.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is a BIG difference between teaching acceptance and normalizing and even encouraging participation in a lifestyle that confuses young children into questioning their sexual identification as though some sort of game and then parents in some cases allow it,” he wrote in an unsolicited “My Thoughts On What I’m Seeing” statement on Sunday.\n",
      "\n",
      "pic.twitter.com/5Gvz6v5HUi\n",
      "\n",
      "He added, “There ARE individuals who as adults may decide reassignment is their needed choice but turning this into a game or parents normalizing it as some sort of natural alternative or believing that because a little boy likes to play dress up in his sister’s clothes or a girl in her brother’s, we should lead them steps further down a path that’s far from the innocence of what they are doing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“With many children who have no real sense of sexuality or sexual experiences caught up in the ‘fun’ of using pronouns and saying what they identify as, some adults mistakenly confuse teaching acceptance with normalizing and encouraging a situation that has been a struggle for those truly affected and have turned it into a sad and dangerous fad,” he concluded.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s unclear what specifically prompted Stanley to make the statement, but what is clear is Stanley has conflated sexuality and gender identity, which develop independently. “People communicate their gender to others through gender expression. This may be done through mannerisms, clothing and hairstyles,” per the Mayo Clinic. “Gender identity develops separately from sexual orientation. People’s sexual orientation is related to whom they’re attracted to on a physical, emotional and romantic basis.”\n",

      "\n",
      "Besides inaccurately describing a person’s gender identity as a “lifestyle,” Stanley’s rant used several other false tropes that are commonly meant to delegitimize trans identities, including a reference to “play[ing] dress up” and conflating gender with sex and sexuality.\n",

      "Morgan Wallen’s One Thing at a Time clocks an eighth consecutive and total week at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart (dated May 6). The set earned 149,000 equivalent album units in the week ending April 27 (down 10%) in the United States, according to Luminate. The album opened at No. 1 on the chart dated March 18 and has yet to cede the summit.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last album to notch eight consecutive weeks at No. 1 was the Encanto soundtrack. It logged eight weeks in a row, of its total nine nonconsecutive frames at No. 1, between the Jan. 29-March 19, 2022-dated charts. Meanwhile, the last album to spend its first eight weeks at No. 1, like One Thing at a Time, was Wallen’s last release, Dangerous: The Double Album, which spent its first 10 weeks at No. 1 (its total run atop the list), from the Jan. 23-March 27, 2021-dated charts.\n",

      "The Billboard 200 chart ranks the most popular albums of the week in the U.S. based on multi-metric consumption as measured in equivalent album units, compiled by Luminate. Units comprise album sales, track equivalent albums (TEA) and streaming equivalent albums (SEA). Each unit equals one album sale, or 10 individual tracks sold from an album, or 3,750 ad-supported or 1,250 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams generated by songs from an album. The new May 6, 2023-dated chart will be posted in full on Billboard‘s website on May 2. For all chart news, follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both Twitter and Instagram.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of One Thing at a Time’s 149,000 equivalent album units earned in the week ending April 27, SEA units comprise 141,000 (down 8%, equaling 188.51 million on-demand official streams of the set’s 36 songs), album sales comprise 5,500 (down 52%) and TEA units comprise 2,500 (down 5%).\n",
      "\n",
      "If One Thing at a Time can spend 10 weeks at No. 1 – matching Dangerous’ No. 1 run – Wallen will become the only act with at least two country albums to have spent 10 or more weeks at No. 1. (Country albums are those that have charted on, or are eligible for, Billboard’s Top Country Albums chart.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, if One Thing at a Time nets a 10th week at No. 1, Wallen would become only the third solo male artist overall to have at least two albums spend 10 or more weeks at No. 1 each, since the Billboard 200 began publishing on a regular, weekly basis in March of 1956. He would join Elvis Presley and Henry Mancini. The former did it four times (his self-titled album [10 weeks in 1956] and the soundtracks for Loving You [10, 1957], G.I. Blues [10, 1960-61] and Blue Hawaii [20, 1961-62]) and the latter did so twice (the soundtracks The Music From Peter Gunn [10, 1959] and Breakfast at Tiffany’s [12, 1962]).\n",
      "\n",
      "Suga’s solo debut studio effort D-Day, under the alias Agust D, debuts at No. 2 on the Billboard 200, with 140,000 equivalent album units earned. It’s the first top 10 for the artist, thus making him the third member of BTS to score a solo top 10 on the Billboard 200. Earlier this year, Jimin also bowed at No. 2 with his solo debut, FACE (April 8-dated chart), while in December, RM peaked at No. 3 with Indigo (Dec. 31). BTS itself has clocked seven top 10s, of which six hit No. 1.\n",

      "Of D-Day’s 140,000 units, album sales comprise 122,000 (it’s the top-selling album of the week and claims the fourth-largest sales week of 2023), SEA units comprise 12,500 (equaling 17.9 million on-demand official streams of the set’s tracks) and TEA units comprise 5,500.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like many K-pop releases, the CD edition of D-Day was issued in collectible CD packages (seven total, including exclusives for Target, Walmart and the Weverse webstore) each containing a standard set of items and randomized elements (in this case, photo cards). It was also available as a standard digital download album, as well as three alternative cover digital download variants that were sold exclusively through the artist’s official webstore. Of D-Day’s first-week sales, 90% were CDs, while the remaining 10% were digital album downloads. The set was not available in any other retail format (such as vinyl or cassette).\n",
      "\n",
      "Taylor Swift makes a splash in the top 10 of the Billboard 200, as her buzzy new Record Store Day-exclusive vinyl release Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions launches at No. 3 with 75,000 equivalent album units earned – all from sales of its vinyl LP. (It’s the single-largest sales week for an album on vinyl in 2023.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The live acoustic album, which was previously available only as bonus tracks on a deluxe digital and streaming edition of her Folklore studio album (released in 2020), was issued on vinyl LP (its first physical release of any kind) for Record Store Day (April 22) at participating independent record stores. It was previously announced that Long Pond’s production run for Record Store Day would be 75,000 copies in the United States, and the set sold out instantly. (It’s typical for many albums and singles to garner unique and limited edition runs exclusively for the annual independent record store day celebration.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions is the companion album to the Disney+ documentary film of the same name, released in November 2020 about the making of the Folklore album.\n",
      "\n",
      "Typically, high-profile Record Store Day-exclusive titles might have a production run of 10,000 to 20,000 in the United States. For Record Store Day 2022, there were 10 titles that had pressings ranging from 10,000 to 18,000, but nothing larger. For Record Store Day 2023, Swift’s Long Pond title had by far the largest production run of any RSD title. Pearl Jam’s live concert album Give Way had the second-biggest production run, with 15,500 vinyl LPs pressed.\n",

      "\n",
      "Plus, with the Long Pond debut, Swift has three albums in the top 10 concurrently for the first time, as former No. 1s Midnights and Lover are Nos. 4 and 10, respectively. The last act to have at least three albums in the top 10 at the same time was Prince in 2016, following his death. That year, there were two weeks when Prince placed at least three weeks in the top 10: the chart dated May 14 (with five titles at Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7) and the May 7 chart (three titles at Nos. 1, 2 and 6). Before Prince, Led Zeppelin had three albums in the top 10 on the June 21, 2014-dated chart, when reissues of its self-titled album, Led Zeppelin II and Led Zeppelin III re-entered the chart at Nos. 7, 9 and 10, respectively, following the release of expanded deluxe editions of the albums.\n",

      "YoungBoy Never Broke Again notches his 14th top 10-charting album on the Billboard 200 (and second of 2023) as his 33-track Don’t Try This at Home bows at No. 5 with 60,000 equivalent album units earned. Streaming activity powers the bulk of the album’s debut, as SEA units comprise 59,000 of that sum (equaling 87.71 million on-demand official streams of the set’s tracks). Album sales comprise 1,000 units while TEA units comprise a negligible sum.\n",

      "If you could read my mind, love / What a tale my thoughts could tell / Just like an old-time movie sings Gordon Lightfoot (1938-2023) through his 1970 ballad “If You Could Read My Mind.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The song, off the late Canadian singer and songwriter’s fifth album, Sit Down Young Stranger, was a letter to someone Lightfoot once loved and was ultimately losing at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Marriage Ended\n",
      "\n",
      "One of Lightfoot’s most personal songs, “If You Could Read My Mind” was written about his deteriorating marriage to first wife Brita Ingegerd Olaisson. The couple were married in 1963 and had two children together, Ingrid and Fred, before their divorce in 1973.\n",
      "\n",
      "[RELATED: Gordon Lightfoot Dies at 84]\n",
      "\n",
      "The lyrics came to Lightfoot one summer in 1969 while he was sitting in his empty house in Toronto that was up for sale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was of course going through some emotional trauma leading up to a separation, so that of course manifested itself in that particular song on that particular afternoon,” said Lightfoot of the song in 2010, remembering the moment he wrote it more than 40 years earlier. “I’ll never forget the afternoon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Loss and Regret\n",
      "\n",
      "The meaning of the song is evident in each verse. Lightfoot moves from ruminating to his own reflections on the relationship to feelings of loneliness and grief.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you could read my mind, loveWhat a tale my thoughts could tellJust like an old time movie‘Bout a ghost from a wishing wellIn a castle dark or a fortress strongWith chains upon my feetYou know that ghost is meAnd I will never be set freeAs long as I am a ghost, you can’t see\n",
      "\n",
      "By the chorus, Lightfoot is trying to read his partner’s mind, and her perception of him at the time, In all honestly, he doesn’t shy away from calling himself a failure and owning up to his mistakes.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I could read your mind, loveWhat a tale your thoughts could tellJust like a paperback novelThe kind the drugstore sellsWhen you reach the part where the heartaches comeThe hero would be meBut heroes often failAnd you won’t read that book againBecause the ending’s just too hard to take\n",
      "\n",
      "I’d walk away like a movie starWho gets burned in a three-way scriptEnter number two, a movie queen to play the sceneOf bringing all the good things out in meBut for now, love, let’s be real\n",
      "\n",
      "The song progresses through the realization that the marriage has ended.\n",
      "\n",
      "I never thought I could act this wayAnd I’ve got to say that I just don’t get itI don’t know where we went wrongBut the feeling’s gone and I just can’t get it back\n",
      "\n",
      "Changing the Lyrics\n",
      "\n",
      "When a song is so personal, it’s not often easy to have enough emotional distance to make any lyrical changes or improvements, but Lightfoot later acquiesced to a request by his daughter from his first marriage, Ingrid, to change one word in the song when he performed the song.\n",
      "\n",
      "[RELATED: 5 Mesmerizing Live Moments in Honor of Gordon Lightfoot]\n",
      "\n",
      "At the request of his daughter, Lightfoot made one slight alteration to the verse I’m just trying to understand the feelings that you lack. Instead, he sang I’m just trying to understand the feelings that we lack when performing the song live.\n",

      "\n",
      "Canadian singer/songwriter Gordon Lightfoot died Monday at the age of 84.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lightfoot had a handful of hits through the ‘70s and early ‘80s, but maybe none has been as everlasting in this region as 1976′s “The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What Gordon Lightfoot did to the shipwreck world was quite amazing,” said Corey Adkins, of the Great Lake Shipwreck Museum. “And I don’t even think he knew that he was doing that at the time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The nearly seven-minute song told the story of the largest ship to ever sink on the Great Lakes\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum, the song brought attention and awareness to shipwrecks along the Great Lakes and opened people to tell more stories.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not the flashiest song but Lightfoot considered ‘The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald’ to be his finest work.\n",
      "\n",
      "“For lack of a better term, it’s not ‘sex drugs, and rock ‘n’ roll,’ it’s a story of loss. I’s a story of what those men went through that night,” said Adkins. “He didn’t really know what happened that night, but this was all from the articles and knowledge that he gathered. He wrote that song and I’m sure he was feeling it. The song is a little simple, but it is a beautiful story.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lightfoot was an honorary board member for the museum and his song plays on a loop at the museum where guests can see the bell from the freighter.\n",

      "\n",
      "Justice Sandra Day O'Connor provided the early framework that steered the outcome in the dispute over the 2000 presidential election and ensured George W. Bush would win the White House over Al Gore, Supreme Court documents released on Tuesday show.\n",
      "\n",
      "Justice Sandra Day O’Connor provided the early framework that steered the outcome in the dispute over the 2000 presidential election and ensured George W. Bush would win the White House over Al Gore, Supreme Court documents released on Tuesday show.\n",
      "\n",
      "Memos found in the newly opened files of the late Justice John Paul Stevens offer a first-ever view of the behind-the-scenes negotiations on Bush v. Gore at the court. They also demonstrate the tension among the nine justices being asked to decide a presidential election on short deadlines.\n",
      "\n",
      "The documents opened at the Library of Congress help reveal how the now-retired O’Connor, the first woman on the high court and a justice steeped in politics from her early days in the Arizona legislature, partnered with Justice Anthony Kennedy, effectively squeezing out an argument advanced by then-Chief Justice William Rehnquist.\n",
      "\n",
      "The strong hand of O’Connor, who was at the ideological center of the court in this era, is not wholly surprising. O’Connor was also known for trying to get out ahead of deliberations, and her four-page memo was circulated to colleagues even before oral arguments. Her move may have guaranteed that she and Kennedy had the greatest influence on the final “per curiam” opinion that spoke for a five-justice majority.\n",
      "\n",
      "That final 5-4 Bush v. Gore decision stopped county recounts for Florida’s decisive presidential electors and gave then-Texas Gov. Bush the victory over then-Vice President Gore.\n",
      "\n",
      "The five conservative justices (O’Connor, Kennedy, Rehnquist, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas) sided with Bush. The four liberal justices (Stevens, with David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer) aligned with Gore and dissented angrily.\n",
      "\n",
      "The court’s views mirrored the deep divisions in the country after an election that for weeks remained too close to call and still haunts presidential contests. The decision has endured as one of the greatest threats to the court’s vaunted impartiality and institutional stature, perhaps eclipsed only recently by the court’s 5-4 decision last June reversing nearly a half century of abortion rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "O’Connor’s views, expressed in a December 10, 2000, memo, were endorsed by fellow conservative-centrist Kennedy as he took the lead in writing the unsigned “per curiam” opinion issued late on the evening of December 12, the new documents show.\n",
      "\n",
      "The shared views of O’Connor and Kennedy eventually forced Rehnquist to abandon his effort to author the main opinion with a boundary-pushing view of federal election principles – views that would come up during Donald Trump’s attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even as the outcome of the case plainly pleased – and alternately upset – a divided nation, questions have remained over the crafting of the unsigned December 12 opinion. It was issued after 36 days of election uncertainty in Florida but just one day after the justices had held oral arguments in Washington.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Florida results had been too close to call at the end of Election Day, November 7. And it became clear that, with other states nearly evenly divided between the candidates, the ultimate winner of Florida’s 25 electoral college votes would become president.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amid ballot recounts in various challenged counties, the Florida secretary of state certified a 537-vote margin on November 26 for Bush, from 6 million votes cast. Bush strove to stop the recounts as Gore continued to challenge the state’s tallies. When the Supreme Court ruled on December 12, it ended the count, declaring that the Florida recount standards varied too widely to be fair and to meet the guarantee of equal protection of the law.\n",
      "\n",
      "O’Connor laid the groundwork for that result in her December 10 memo to all her colleagues as she condemned a Florida state Supreme Court decision ordering selective recounts of “undervotes” in certain counties.\n",
      "\n",
      "She opened by highlighting state legislative authority to set the rules for the appointment of state presidential electors but quickly focused on the flaws, as she perceived them, of the ongoing recounts ordered by the state court.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sandra Day O'Connor reflects on life before, during and after the Supreme Court\n",
      "\n",
      "“The Florida Supreme Court provided no uniform, statewide method for identifying and separating the undervotes,” O’Connor wrote, referring to instances when machines had failed to detect a vote for president. “Accordingly, there was no guarantee that those ballots deemed undervotes had not been previously tabulated. More importantly, the court failed to provide any standard more specific than the ‘intent of the voter’ standard to govern this statewide undervote recount. Therefore, each individual county was left to devise its own standards.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The system triggered by the Florida Supreme Court “in no way resembles the statutory scheme created by the Florida legislature” for the appointment of electors, said the justice who had once served as Arizona state Senate majority leader, the first woman nationwide to hold such the top post in a state senate.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day, Kennedy wrote to the chief justice, “Sandra’s memorandum sets forth a very sound approach” and said he wanted to build on it. He suggested he would point up how the varying recount practices breached the guarantee of equal protection.\n",
      "\n",
      "The correspondence in the Stevens files suggests that Rehnquist thought he might be able to work with Kennedy on the court’s main opinion and to press the chief’s own theory of complete and independent state legislative power.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rehnquist wrote in a December 11 memo that he and Kennedy were “working on a composite opinion.” Rehnquist hoped to send around a copy that evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the next day, however, Kennedy had fully separated himself from Rehnquist’s view of complete state legislative authority over presidential elections with no check by a state judges interpreting the state’s constitution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some Republicans call for more transparency around Supreme Court while calling Democratic push for ethics reform partisan\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, Rehnquist wrote to the group, his own “present draft cannot accurately be labeled” the opinion for the court. Rehnquist said he would be re-circulating his views, going beyond the O’Connor-Kennedy position, as a separate concurring opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Rehnquist view, backed only by Scalia and Thomas, would have given new power to state legislatures to control presidential election battles. Under this “independent state legislature” theory – which was revived by Trump supporters in 2020 and is at the heart of a pending North Carolina dispute – state courts lack the authority to find that a state legislature’s electoral practices violate the state’s constitution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kennedy had foreshadowed his reluctance to accept that theory during the Bush v. Gore oral arguments. “It seems to me essential to the republican theory of government that the constitutions of the United States and the states are the basic charter, and to say that the legislature of the state is unmoored from its own constitution, and it can’t use its court … (is) it seems to me a holding which has grave implications for our republican theory of government.”\n",
      "\n",
      "O’Connor, similarly breaking from the Rehnquist view, wrote Kennedy a note on December 12 that she would join his per curiam opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other justices, meanwhile, were immersed in their separate writings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stevens’ files contain early drafts of his dissenting opinion that closed with the biting line: “Although we may never know with complete certainty the identity of the winner of this year’s Presidential election, the identity of the loser is perfectly clear,” he wrote. “It is the Nation’s confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of the rule of law.”\n",
      "\n",

      "The majority contended that no time remained to standardize recount rules to meet constitutional strictures for equal protection of the law. Its per curiam decision was concluding that Florida’s recount process was “inconsistent with the minimum procedures necessary to protect the fundamental right of each voter in the special instance of a statewide recount.” The majority also declared, “Our consideration is limited to the present circumstances, for the problem of equal protection in election processes generally presents many complexities.”\n",

I suggest we strive mightily to have everything in shape for the Pubs unit by four o’clock this afternoon at the latest.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Later that day, Rehnquist tried again: “David (Souter) advises that he is preparing a dissent, which he thinks he will be able to circulate by 5 o’clock p.m. I think that we should move the deadline back once more, but this time be absolutely certain that all opinions in this case be ready to go to the Publications Unit by 6 o’clock. The Pubs Unit will probably take at least an hour to prepare it, and this means that it can be released at 7 o’clock p.m. I urge all of you to keep up the efforts we have all been making, because I am unwilling to move the deadline further back unless there is some sort of a mechanical breakdown.”\n",

Even to the point of footnote 4 in Ruth’s offering (I call it the Al Sharpton footnote), alleging on the basis of press reports ‘obstacles to voting disproportionately encountered by black voters.’”\n",

      "Well-known for his take-no-prisoners dissenting views, Scalia added, “I am the last person to complain that dissents should not be thorough and hard-hitting (though it would be nice to have them somewhat consolidated). But before vigorously dissenting (or, come to think of it, at any other time) I have never urged the majority of my colleagues to alter their honest view of the case because of the potential ‘damage to the Court.’ I just thought I would observe the incongruity. Good night.” He signed it, “Sincerely, Nino.”\n",

I take the occasion in this memo, however, to say that the tone of the dissents is disturbing both on an institutional and personal level. I have agonized over this and made my best judgment. Some of the dissenters in fact agree on the equal protection point, but take great pains to conceal that agreement. The dissents, permit me to say, in effect try to coerce the majority by trashing the Court themselves, thereby making their dire, and I think unjustified, predictions a self-fulfilling prophecy.”\n",

      "\n",
      "Check out plenty of Ice Spice's funniest tweets before the fame.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most celebrities would get a bit anxious once their old tweets resurface, but Ice Spice’s past Twitter posts haven’t put her in hot water. In fact, as her tweets have made their fair share of rounds on social media lately, internet detectives have come to the conclusion that she should only be celebrated and not canceled because of how hilarious her aged posts are.\n",
      "\n",
      "Granted, Ice’s ascension is still rather new. Credited to the 2022 release of \"Munch (Feelin’ U)\" and the rise of The Bronx’s drill wave, she blew up last year. So many of her throwback posts are actually from the late 2010s and early 2020s, where she was still young, in school and manifesting her future as an artist. But that's just a testament to how quickly things can change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of her most hilarious thoughts came from simply engaging with her peers on the platform. Take for example back in 2018, where a Twitter user posted that they didn't like therapy. Ice used that moment to reveal that she walked away from treatment, writing, \"Had to stop going cus I was lying 2 da lady.\" An instance in which people got a kick out of Ice's candid reaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's just a small glimpse into a Twitter archive that has now worked in Ice Spice's favor as a mainstream artist who has charted on Billboard, collaborated with hip-hop legends and got a personal invite to the annual Met Gala. Now that she's in the clear for her old posts, it’s time to look back at what her unshielded personality was like pre-fame. A solid handful of tweets included in this article have gone viral, and others XXL dug up. Check out Ice Spice's funniest tweets from back in the day.\n",

      "A text message sent by Tucker Carlson that set off a panic at the highest levels of Fox on the eve of its billion-dollar defamation trial showed its most popular host sharing his private, inflammatory views about violence and race.\n",
      "\n",
      "The discovery of the message contributed to a chain of events that ultimately led to Mr. Carlson’s firing.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the message, sent to one of his producers in the hours after violent Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, Mr. Carlson described how he had recently watched a video of a group of men — Trump supporters, he said — violently attacking “an Antifa kid.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was “three against one, at least,” he wrote.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then he expressed a sense of dismay that the attackers, like him, were white.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jumping a guy like that is dishonorable obviously,” he wrote.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s not how white men fight,” he said. But he said he found himself for a moment wanting the group to kill the person he had described as the Antifa kid.\n",
      "\n",
      "A couple of weeks ago, I was watching video of people fighting on the street in Washington. A group of Trump guys surrounded an Antifa kid and started pounding the living shit out of him. It was three against one, at least. Jumping a guy like that is dishonorable obviously. It’s not how white men fight. Yet suddenly I found myself rooting for the mob against the man, hoping they’d hit him harder, kill him. I really wanted them to hurt the kid. I could taste it. Then somewhere deep in my brain, an alarm went off: this isn’t good for me. I’m becoming something I don’t want to be. The Antifa creep is a human being. Much as I despise what he says and does, much as I’m sure I’d hate him personally if I knew him, I shouldn’t gloat over his suffering. I should be bothered by it. I should remember that somewhere somebody probably loves this kid, and would be crushed if he was killed. If I don’t care about those things, if I reduce people to their politics, how am I better than he is?\n",
      "\n",
      "For years, Mr. Carlson espoused views on his show that amplified the ideology of white nationalism. But the text message revealed more about his views on racial superiority.\n",
      "\n",
      "The text alarmed the Fox board, which saw the message a day before Fox was set to defend itself against Dominion Voting Systems before a jury. The board grew concerned that the message could become public at trial when Mr. Carlson was on the stand, creating a sensational and damaging moment that would raise broader questions about the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "The day after the discovery, the board told Fox executives it was bringing in an outside law firm to conduct an investigation into Mr. Carlson’s conduct.\n",
      "\n",
      "The text message added to a growing number of internal issues involving Mr. Carlson that led the company’s leadership to conclude he was more of a problem than an asset and had to go, according to several people with knowledge of the decision. In other messages he had referred to women — including a senior Fox executive — in crude and misogynistic terms. The message about the fight also played a role in the company’s decision to settle with Dominion for $787.5 million, the highest known payout in a defamation case.\n",
      "\n",
      "A representative for Mr. Carlson said he had no comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The text is part of redacted court filings and its contents were previously unreported. The contents of the text were disclosed in interviews with several people close to the defamation lawsuit against Fox. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to be identified discussing a message that is protected by a court order. In public filings, it remains hidden behind a block of black text.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Carlson’s messages were collected as part of the defamation lawsuit filed against Fox by Dominion, which accused the network of knowingly airing falsehoods about election fraud. Many of the messages shared in the case, including those among Fox executives and hosts, were released publicly. But others, like the one between Mr. Carlson and one of his producers in the hours after Jan. 6, 2021, remain redacted.\n",
      "\n",
      "In that text, Mr. Carlson described his own emotions as he watched the video of the violent clash, which he said took place on the streets of Washington. Mr. Carlson did not describe the race of the man being attacked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I found myself rooting for the mob against the man, hoping they’d hit him harder, kill him. I really wanted them to hurt the kid. I could taste it,” he wrote. “Then somewhere deep in my brain, an alarm went off: this isn’t good for me. I’m becoming something I don’t want to be.”\n",
      "\n",
      "After all, he wrote, “Somebody probably loves this kid, and would be crushed if he was killed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If I don’t care about those things, if I reduce people to their politics, how am I better than he is?” he wrote.\n",
      "\n",
      "The text message came to the attention of Fox’s board of directors and even some senior executives only last month, on the Sunday before the trial was set to begin, according to two people with knowledge of Fox’s internal deliberations. At the time, Fox’s negotiators were entering discussions about an out-of-court settlement ahead of the swearing in of what was shaping up to be a diverse jury.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day, the board told Fox’s leadership about its plan to have the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz investigate Mr. Carlson. That disclosure set up the possibility that there could be a continuing investigation into what was behind Mr. Carlson’s messages at the same time as a trial, and as he was serving as its top host in prime time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fox has not commented about Mr. Carlson’s ouster last week beyond an initial statement announcing that they “agreed to part ways” and thanking “him for his service.” It did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday on the contents of Mr. Carlson’s redacted message.\n",
      "\n",
      "It remains unclear how the text escaped more notice earlier, given that the Fox legal team was aware of it and other offensive texts written by Mr. Carlson. Fox’s lawyers had produced the text as part of the discovery process and were involved in the redactions. Mr. Carlson had even been asked about it during a deposition, according to several people who have read the unredacted transcripts of his deposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not guaranteed that the text would have been revealed in open court. Dominion’s lawyers had still not decided whether they would introduce the text in front of the jury, according to people with knowledge of their plans. The two sides disagreed on whether the Dominion lawyers could have presented such a redacted message at trial if they had decided to do so, a decision that would have ultimately fallen to the judge. The difference became moot after Fox struck an 11th-hour deal on April 18 to pay Dominion $787.5 million and avoid trial.\n",
      "\n",
      "How Fox’s executives and board handled the case in the months before the trial was scheduled to begin is expected to be at issue in shareholder lawsuits filed against the company in Delaware.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though Mr. Carlson’s show, “Tucker Carlson Tonight,” was only a small factor in the Dominion suit, his personal texts were drawing outsize scrutiny.\n",
      "\n",
      "The text about the fight came on top of a damaging chain of messages that had been revealed publicly ahead of trial, and that were shocking in their own right. Writing to one of his producers after the assault on the Capitol, Mr. Carlson describes the president he championed on his show as a “demonic force” and a “destroyer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A recurring theme of his show during the six years that it ran in prime time on Fox News was the displacement of white Americans by people of color. Mr. Carlson often framed topics in the news as part of a larger struggle between “us” and “them,” with immigrants and other marginalized groups steadily and surely taking from whites what had long been theirs: political and cultural power in the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "He attacked Black social justice activists and portrayed immigrants from Central America as a blight on the nation. He said in 2018 that immigrants make the country “dirtier.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In the aftermath of a mass shooting in El Paso at the hands of a gunman who cited white supremacist beliefs in his manifesto, Mr. Carlson declared on his show that white supremacy was “not a real problem,” likening it to a conspiracy theory.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "On the eve of what was expected to be the most closely watched defamation trial in a generation, the board of Fox Corp. last month reviewed a text message that Tucker Carlson, a prime-time star on Fox News, had sent to one of his producers in early 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the message, he described himself watching a video of Donald Trump supporters beating up someone he referred to as “an Antifa kid.” Carlson wrote of his conflicting emotions, hinting at his dismay that he had found himself “rooting for the mob against the man, hoping they’d hit him harder, kill him.”\n",

      "The text message, first reported Tuesday night by the New York Times, added to a cascading set of concerns about Carlson within Fox News that led the company to fire him last week, according to several people familiar with the internal deliberations around his departure from the network.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Washington Post reported last week that network co-founder Rupert Murdoch had also grown concerned about Carlson’s increasingly far-right commentary — including his disparagement of U.S. support for Ukraine — and that executives had noted his harsh critiques of Fox management in his private communications, including some sexist and vulgar language aimed at a female executive.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Fox Corp. spokesperson declined to comment late Tuesday. A representative for Carlson did not respond to messages seeking comment.\n",

      "\n",
      "When Herschel Walker emailed a representative for billionaire industrialist and longtime family friend Dennis Washington in March 2022, he seemed to be engaging in normal behavior for a political candidate: He was asking for money.\n",
      "\n",
      "But unbeknownst to Washington and the billionaire’s staff, Walker’s request was far more out of the ordinary. It was something campaign finance experts are calling “unprecedented,” “stunning,” and “jaw-dropping.” Walker wasn’t just asking for donations to his campaign; he was soliciting hundreds of thousands of dollars for his own personal company—a company that he never disclosed on his financial statements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emails obtained by The Daily Beast—and verified as authentic by a person with knowledge of the exchanges—show that Walker asked Washington to wire $535,200 directly to that undisclosed company, HR Talent, LLC.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the emails reveal that not only did Washington complete Walker’s wire requests, he was under the impression that these were, in fact, political contributions.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the best possible circumstances, legal experts told The Daily Beast, the emails suggest violations of federal fundraising rules; in the worst case, they could be an indication of more serious crimes, such as wire fraud.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Walker—who had been schooled on campaign finance rules since his campaign launched in August 2021, according to a person involved in those conversations—appears to have dismissed the Washington team’s concerns that the money may have gone to the wrong place. When a third party informed a Washington Companies executive that the money couldn’t be used for political purposes, they raised the issue with Walker, asking at one point whether the funds should be redirected to a super PAC supporting his candidacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Walker never contributed any of his own money to his campaign, according to Federal Election Commission filings, and it’s unclear what happened to these particular funds. Walker may have ultimately returned the money to Washington, but he did not reroute the money to the super PAC, according to FEC filings and a person with direct knowledge of the events.\n",
      "\n",
      "(A day after this story was published, a spokesperson for Washington said Walker had refunded the money but did not respond to questions about when that happened.)\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was good talking with you today,” Tim McHugh, executive vice president for the Washington Corporations, wrote to Walker last November. “After our call, [redacted] reached out to me and said [a person] clarified with you that any funds sent to the HR Talent account cannot legally be used for political purposes. Political contributions must go to either the Team Herschel or 34N22 accounts.”\n",
      "\n",
      "34N22 was a super PAC supporting Walker. Walker was not allowed to solicit donations for the super PAC in excess of federal limits, which this amount of money explicitly was. But that was not McHugh’s concern; he was worried about the hundreds of thousands of dollars his boss had wired to HR Talent in March.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We will need your assistance to get the prior contributions made to the HR Talent account in March corrected,” McHugh concluded in the email.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Walker’s campaign was battered from the jump by a hurricane of controversies, this situation stands out.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the legal experts who spoke to The Daily Beast for this article, this scheme appears to not just be illegal—it appears to be unparalleled in its audacity and scope. The transactions raise questions about a slew of possible violations. In fact, these experts all said, the scheme was so brazen that it appears to defy explanation, ranking it among the most egregious campaign finance violations in modern history.\n",
      "\n",
      "Saurav Ghosh, director of federal reform at Campaign Legal Center, called the arrangement “jaw-dropping.” Jordan Libowitz, communications director at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said if Walker “used the campaign to funnel money into his own business, that’s one of the biggest campaign finance crimes I’ve ever heard of.” Brendan Fischer, a campaign finance lawyer and deputy executive director of Documented, remarked that the exchanges were “stunning and, to my knowledge, without parallel in recent history.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Campaign finance laws are designed to prevent massive under-the-table payments like those described here,” Fischer said. “While we don’t have all the facts, these emails point to highly illegal, potentially even criminal activity.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul S. Ryan, a campaign finance specialist and deputy executive director at the Funders’ Committee for Civic Participation, said the situation suggests a “criminal violation” that is “extraordinary and unprecedented in my 25 years of campaign finance watchdog work.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s no legal way that this could have played out,” Ryan said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither Walker nor his wife, Julie Blanchard, returned The Daily Beast’s detailed request for comment. Representatives for Washington also didn’t reply to The Daily Beast’s questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Federal law prohibits candidates from converting campaign donations to personal use. The law also limits how much money individuals can contribute to a campaign, as well as how much candidates can solicit from donors. Candidates also cannot solicit, accept, or facilitate contributions in the name of another person.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to legal experts, campaign finance violations become criminal if the violation was “knowing and willful”—essentially, if the person understands the laws.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the time of the first email, Walker had already been a candidate for half a year, raising millions of dollars along the way. And he was repeatedly coached on fundraising limits and restrictions since the beginning of his campaign, according to a person involved in those conversations—a fact that is demonstrated in the emails when Walker provides a breakdown of federal donation limits.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Daily Beast reported last month that Walker’s wife, Julie Blanchard—out of concerns about the campaign’s impact on their income stream—tried to personally profit from the campaign. But Walker staffers repeatedly waved her off. Walker claimed a net worth between $29 million and $62 million, according to his most recent personal financial disclosure. Last year, he reported an income in excess of $4 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Washington emails explicitly raise the issue of wire fraud, legal experts told The Daily Beast, if Walker falsely represented his intentions for the money, saying they were for the campaign while in fact they were for his company. But if he did use the money to support his political activity, that would also trigger a separate slate of legal questions, because Walker never reported spending any of his own money on his campaign.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s the frying pan or the fire,” Ghosh said.\n",
      "\n",
      "In all, the emails indicate that Walker solicited a combined $700,000 in political contributions from the Washingtons, instructing that more than $600,000 of that amount be wired directly to one of his companies, HR Talent.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That sounds like a criminal violation of the ‘soft money’ ban,” Ryan said. “It is illegal for a candidate for federal office to solicit or direct money outside of federal contribution limits. Even if the money wasn’t spent in the election, Walker would have broken the law when he directed this donor to give money above contribution limits in connection with the election.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Washington also gave significant money to 34N22—Walker’s super PAC—making a $500,000 contribution days after Walker initially asked for the $535,200, Federal Election Commission records show.\n",
      "\n",
      "A super PAC representative confirmed that the $500,000 came from Washington directly. And according to a person with direct knowledge of the events, that $500,000 didn’t come out of the $535,200—they were two separate transactions. That would indicate that, at least for eight months, Walker’s company directly pocketed the $535,200.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first of the emails obtained by The Daily Beast were timestamped 9:39 p.m. on March 1, 2022. It came from Walker’s personal AOL account, and was addressed to Jerry Lemon—chief financial officer at the Washington Companies—with Blanchard copied at her Mac.com address.\n",
      "\n",
      "The subject line read, “Wire Instructions for Team Herschel People’s Champion Committee,” a reference to a joint fundraising committee for the Walker campaign (“THPCC”). The email directed Lemon to send a combined $600,000, with most of it going to Walker’s company, HR Talent.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The wiring instruction for the $64,800 is below,” the email said, and instructed Lemon to contact a campaign fiduciary about those donations.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The $535,200 can be wired to H R Talent,” Walker’s email continued. He provided the name of two banks—one of which also holds a personal account of Walker’s valued up to $50,000, according to his disclosures—along with account and routing information. The message also instructed Lemon to “send the information to Denise Stokes”—Walker’s sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few days later, Washington donations rolled in. FEC records show that the $64,800 appears to have been split into six even donations to THPCC in the maximum allowable amount, attributed to Washington, his wife, his two sons, and their wives.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s unclear what happened to the $535,200. But nine months later, Walker was asking his friend for still more cash.\n",
      "\n",
      "In that Nov. 29 email, McHugh confirmed that, in March, the Washingtons had wired what they believed were campaign contributions to Walker’s personal company. While McHugh asked about redirecting the money HR Talent had received to Walker’s super PAC—to make sure they “get the funds to the right spot”—Walker didn’t address that question in his response. Instead, he just reiterated that more money, nearly $100,000, should be sent straight to his company.\n",
      "\n",
      "The numbers suggest that Walker had worked out a $100,000 arrangement with each Washington, with 95 percent of their contributions going to Walker’s company instead of the super PAC. But while Dennis Washington’s $5,800 campaign donations from the time do appear in FEC records, the $95,400 never hit the super PAC’s account. Kyle and Kevin Washington did not donate any money after the November emails.\n",
      "\n",
      "McHugh’s email ended by asking Walker to rectify the original transfer to HR Talent, but it’s not immediately clear whether Walker refunded the money—or whether the two sons were owed refunds out of the original $535,200.\n",
      "\n",
      "It wasn’t the only boost Washington gave his friend’s campaign.\n",
      "\n",
      "Washington and Walker go way back. A person familiar with their relationship recalled a close relationship, including extended family vacations. And according to this person, Washington played an instrumental role in securing Walker a coveted award while his campaign was in full swing.\n",
      "\n",
      "On April 7, 2022, Herschel Walker’s Senate campaign announced that the former college football hero would receive the Horatio Alger Association’s prestigious annual award, “dedicated to leaders who through hard work, honesty, and determination have overcome great obstacles in their lives.”\n",
      "\n",
      "(As for the campaign’s testament to Walker’s honesty, The Daily Beast revealed months later that the candidate had been repeatedly lying to his top brass—including about the existence of some of his own children.)\n",
      "\n",
      "While the campaign made political hay out of the moment, it didn’t put Walker over the top. He lost to Democratic incumbent Sen. Raphael Warnock in a December runoff election.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last month, however, it came full circle. The Walker campaign reported a $250,000 charitable donation to the Horatio Alger Association. But the organization did not list the campaign’s gift on its donor page this year. It did, however, list Walker and Blanchard as personal sponsors at the $250,000 tier. It’s unclear whether Walker was taking personal credit for his campaign’s gift, or if he’d contributed separately.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the fundraising solicitation, legal experts pointed out several issues with the arrangement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ryan, of the Funders’ Committee, said that Walker’s email explaining fundraising limits—along with the fact that Walker had by that point received months of counseling on fundraising regulations—is “strong evidence that Walker knew what the law prohibited and solicited this money nonetheless.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That would make this a crime, if it’s done knowingly and willfully,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fischer, of Documented, concurred, saying the email “does seem to lay out knowledge of campaign finance regulations and then offers ways to explicitly get around those regulations. It sure sounds like a knowing and willful violation of campaign finance law, which would make this criminal.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He also raised the question of how the money was spent.\n",
      "\n",
      "One scenario, Fischer said, “is that the $535,000 gift was used to cover personal expenses.” If so, he continued, that could violate provisions in the ban on personal use, saying that statute is particularly relevant because those violations have previously sent people to prison.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fischer pointed to 11 CFR 113.1(g)(6) in the U.S. criminal code, under which a payment by a third person of a candidate’s personal expenses during the campaign is a contribution.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Payments by a third party made for the purpose of influencing an election and that are coordinated with a candidate or their agent result in a contribution, subject to limits and reporting requirements,” he explained. “Giving over a half million dollars to a candidate is potentially an excessive and unreported contribution. This is a very serious violation of campaign finance law, and it is still a violation if the funds were used for personal expenses instead of campaign expenses.”\n",
      "\n",
      "While Walker and Washington are close friends, Fischer said it could be tough to argue that the payment would have been made even if Walker weren’t running for office.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here, perhaps the donor can show a series of similar payments that began before Walker became a candidate, but even that may not be dispositive,” Fischer said. He called the emails “strong evidence” that the solicitations and payment were for the purpose of influencing the election.\n",
      "\n",
      "Libowitz called the scheme “brazen in a way that we’ve never seen,” distinguishing it even from Donald Trump’s efforts to enrich himself by spending campaign cash at his businesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s not like Trump, because Trump’s campaign isn’t prohibited from spending money at his own businesses as long as he’s paying market rates and there were services rendered,” Libowitz said. “Here, the money isn’t being spent by the campaign on Herschel’s businesses. The money never even goes to the campaign. It just goes straight to him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Ghosh, of the Campaign Legal Center, agreed that Walker appears to have violated campaign finance laws, calling the scheme “$500,000 of grift.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It appears to be a fake campaign solicitation, designed to just profit personally from someone. That’s brazen in a way that’s off the charts,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "He also pointed out that Walker didn’t disclose HR Talent, LLC in his candidate financial statements—yet another significant issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A federal candidate has to disclose their personal assets, including any sources of income, so failing to disclose a company or a personal bank account would violate the legal requirement and deny voters crucial information about the candidate, undermining electoral transparency,” Ghosh said.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Georgia business records, HR Talent, LLC was first registered in the state in 2002, as “Renaissance Man Medical, LLC”—a branch of a Delaware company registered that year—with Walker’s signature on the incorporation documents. Three years later, Walker changed the name to “Renaissance Man Marketing, LLC,” then changed it again to “HR Talent, LLC” in 2014.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the time, Walker was launching a short-lived reality competition show designed to discover entertainment talent in rural communities, which he called “Herschel’s Raw Talent.” The New York Times reported that the show only hosted events in two Georgia counties before it fizzled out. But Walker personally signed annual business registration documents until 2021, when his sister Carol signed. The company lists its address at Walker’s childhood home in Wrightsville.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ghosh also noted that if Walker had misrepresented the purpose of the payment, “Then we’re in the world of just defrauding somebody.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sounds a lot like wire fraud if the money didn’t make it to the campaign or super PAC,” Ghosh said. “And the fact they tried to do it again shows they’re trying to squeeze this billionaire.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Former federal prosecutors told The Daily Beast that the situation merits a criminal investigation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If Walker represented to a donor that a contribution was intended for his campaign, but it was actually for his personal benefit, it could form the basis for wire fraud,” former U.S. Attorney Joyce Vance said. “Prosecutors would have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that any defendants knowingly devised a scheme to defraud and intended to defraud.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Vance noted that if a donation was inappropriately channeled through Walker’s company, “an investigation could reveal whether that was a one-off or whether additional activity occurred there,” adding that the omission from his disclosures “could suggest an effort to obscure transactions.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Former U.S. Attorney Barb McQuade agreed that the facts merit a formal investigation. She explained that, to get a conviction, prosecutors would have to “prove that at the time he extracted the money, he intended to use it differently than what he said he’d do. So you need to show why he said he wanted the money, what he represented to the donor, and what in fact it was used for.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That could be fraud, but you need a subpoena to find the missing pieces,” she said.\n",

      "Nelly, 48, and Ashanti, 42, were seen holding hands as they walked through T-Mobile Arena late last month, during the Gervonta Davis vs. Ryan Garcia fight. In another video posted to social media, the duo was captured performing their hit \"Body on Me,\" during a pool party.\n",

      "Miguel's &quot;Sure Thing&quot; breaks the record for the most weeks ever on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart thanks to its second wind via TikTok this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This achievement is a wild reminder of how things – all across the board - can cycle back into cultural relevance,\" Miguel tells Billboard.\n",

      "Thanks to its second wind 11 years after its initial chart run, Miguel’s “Sure Thing” breaks the record for the title with the most weeks on Billboard’s Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.\n",
      "\n",
      "The track logs an unprecedented 76th week on the list dated May 6, surpassing the 75-week marathon of the previous record holder, Mary J. Blige’s “Be Without You” in one continuous run in 2005-07.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure Thing” achieves the record-breaking mark as it jumps 8-6 on the newest published chart. The song, released in 2010, is enjoying a TikTok-fueled renaissance, as a sped-up version, has soundtracked more than 4 million videos on the social media platform. While activity TikTok does not directly contribute to the Billboard charts, many of the app’s most popular songs have seen corresponding gains on streaming services that factor into Billboard chart rankings.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m glad that ‘Sure Thing’ still connects and resonates with a new audience, and that they feel what I’ve always felt with this song,” Miguel tells Billboard upon hearing the news of his new honor. “More than anything, this achievement is a wild reminder of how things – all across the board – can cycle back into cultural relevance.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A clear hit today, “Sure Thing” was a smash in its original era too. The second single from Miguel’s 2010 debut album, All I Want Is You, reached No. 1 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart for one week among the 61 total frames it logged in its initial run. Starting with its No. 20 re-entry on the list on the chart dated Jan. 14, 2023, “Sure Thing” has since added 15 more weeks to its total to accumulate its historic run.\n",
      "\n",
      "As “Sure Thing” resets the leaderboard, here is a look at the tracks with the most weeks at No. 1 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart since it became an all-encompassing genre survey in 1958:\n",
      "\n",
      "Weeks on Chart, Song Title, Artist, Peak Position, Year(s) Charted76, “Sure Thing,” Miguel, No. 1 (one week), 2011-12, 202375, “Be Without You,” Mary J. Blige, No. 1 (15), 2005-0774, “God in Me,” Mary Mary featuring Kierra “KiKi” Sheard, No. 5, 2008-1073, “On the Ocean,” K’Jon, No. 12, 2008-1071, “You Make Me Wanna…,” Usher, No. 1 (11), 1997-9871, “There Goes My Baby,” Usher, No. 1 (four), 2010-1170, “Step in the Name of Love,” R. Kelly, No. 1 (two), 2002-0468, “Can’t Let Go,” Anthony Hamilton, No. 13, 2005-0766, “Blinding Lights, The Weeknd, No. 1 (11), 2019-2163, “In My Bed,” Dru Hill, No. 1 (three), 1997-9863, “Just Fine,” Mary J. Blige, No. 3, 2007-08\n",
      "\n",
      "Though “Sure Thing” has already secured its place in the record books, it’s primed to extend its stay on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, which blends streaming, radio airplay and sales data into its rankings. In the latest tracking week (April 21-27), the song improved in two of the three metrics: sales and radio airplay. “Sure Thing” sold 2,000 downloads, up 21% from the previous frame and registered 46.6 million in total audience, a 10% increase from the prior week, according to Luminate. While the former No. 1 R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart hit is receiving renewed play at that format, the majority of “Sure Thing” radio success comes from the pop and rhythmic format this time around. The single repeats at its No. 5 peak thus far on this week’s Pop Airplay chart – after never having made the list in its initial era – and advances 21-19 on Rhythmic Airplay, nearing its No. 14 peak from July 2011.\n",
      "\n",
      "Radio gains help counter streaming slides in the past weeks, though the song maintains an overall high count. “Sure Thing” generated 11.1 million official U.S. streams in the most recent tracking week, essentially even with the prior week, and keeps it near its performance in prior weeks, with 11.1 million, 11.4 million and 11.7 million totals in the past three weeks, respectively.\n",

      "Doja Cat might have attended her first and last Met Gala.\n",
      "\n",
      "The famed Met Gala took place on Monday night (May 1), with Doja Cat stealing the show after showing up looking like a real-life cat by using special effects prosthetics. However, if statements made during a recent interview by Vogue editor-in-chief and Met Gala host Anna Wintour hold true, Doja might not get a second invite.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Monday, Anna Wintour and Met Museum Costume Institute curator-in-charge Andrew Bolton sat down with CBS' Gayle King for an interview about the must-attend event. During the sit-down, King asked the duo, \"What's the best way to be invited and what's the best way to never be invited back again? What really ticks you off, Anna?\"\n",

      "\"Those would be no-nos,\" Andrew added.\n",

      "\"I haven’t smoked nicotine in like 10 weeks,\" she told the publication. \"And then Elle just came out with a shoot where I’m smoking a cigarette, but it was when I was smoking. They’ve had these photos in this interview for a thousand years, and now people are like, 'Oh my God, she’s smoking again.' But I don’t smoke. I’m nicotine-free. And I love nicotine-free vapes. Any zero-nicotine vape doesn’t hit, it just feels like you’re breathing and it’s like, 'What is this?' It feels pointless. But this thing really feels… It hits, it has the same effect. I also got hypnotherapy.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Jamil, best known for starring in NBC’s “The Good Place,” wrote on Instagram that “Hollywood and fashion said the quiet part out loud when a lot of famous feminists chose to celebrate at the highest level, a man who was so publicly cruel to women, to fat people, to immigrants and to sexual assault survivors.”\n",

      "\n",
      "The gala’s theme this year coincided with an exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute, titled “Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty,” which a Met spokesperson told CNN aligned with the museum’s “mission to explore art and creativity from the ancient times through today, and to examine moments of great importance and impact so we can gain a deeper understanding of art and history and invite dialogue and further reflection.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This year’s Costume Institute exhibition does just that, by presenting the work of a singularly impactful designer—Karl Lagerfeld—whose innovation and unique working methodology have made undeniably seismic contributions to the worlds of both fashion and art.”\n",
      "\n",
      "CNN also reached out to Vogue, which organizes the gala, for comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Celebrities, fashion elite and New York’s high society walked the famous red carpet at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Monday, wearing extravagant outfits that paid homage to Lagerfeld, who was best known for transforming Chanel into one of the world’s most valuable fashion houses during his time as its creative director.\n",
      "\n",
      "But for all his influence as a designer, he was also a controversial figure, making a number of disparaging statements that upheld narrow standards of beauty or cast criticism on the #MeToo movement.\n",

      "In vintage couture and a world of Chanel-inspired camellias. In pearls, chains and black ties, especially those worn by women. The A-list crowd at the Met Gala on Monday largely passed muster in embracing Karl Lagerfeld, the man of the evening. That's most. Not all. Over-the-top dressing for fashion's biggest night isn’t dead. Misinterpreting or outright ignoring the night’s dress code isn’t buried.

      "NEW YORK (AP) — In vintage couture and a world of Chanel-inspired camellias. In pearls, chains and black ties, especially those worn by women, the A-list crowd at the Met Gala largely passed muster in embracing Karl Lagerfeld, the man of the evening on fashion’s biggest night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most. Not all. Over-the-top dressing on the first Monday in May isn’t dead. Misinterpreting or outright ignoring the night’s dress code isn’t buried. But this time around, there was an air of respect, a nod to authenticity “in honor of Karl,” as the fundraising party’s visionary, Anna Wintour, requested.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because the theme was so specific, it practically demanded elegance, which is why so many looked so good. But what was most surprising was to see how other designers paid homage to the master with riffs on his iconic trademarks,” said Hal Rubenstein, a fashion writer, designer and one of the founding editors of InStyle magazine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lagerfeld, the man, the photographer, the publisher, the designer for hire at Chanel, Fendi, Chloé and more, died in February 2019 after 65 years in fashion. Few designers have made the deep cultural impact he did, especially within the confines of carrying on historic heritage legacies.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was “about elegance and craftsmanship, a total 180 from the Hollywood parade the Met Ball had become in the last few years,” Rubenstein said.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Lagerfeld did it in his own unique uniform: white powdered low ponytail, skinny black pants and jackets, black fingerless gloves, high crisp white collars and black ties. And dark glasses. Always dark glasses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other critics and fashion insiders agreed with Rubenstein. Let’s not forget the muddled gala theme “Punk: Chaos to Couture” in 2013 with a fashion vibe that managed to offend actual punks, or the two galas last year and the year before that honored American fashion with a slew of guests dressed by European and other non-American brands.\n",
      "\n",
      "But some fashion watchers weren’t altogether bothered by this year’s stunts, many aimed at Lagerfeld’s beloved cat, Choupette.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jared Leto was a furry human (sweaty) Choupette in a Disney-worthy costume. Doja Cat was an actual cat, thanks to facial prosthetics. Lil Nas X was, well, Lil Nas X, slathered in silver paint wearing a chunky pearl and jeweled cat face mask, thong and boots — and nothing else, thanks to makeup legend Pat McGrath and Dior Men.\n",
      "\n",
      "And some fans of the celebrities lucky enough to score invitations this year were often delighted, regardless. The “Last of Us” star Pedro Pascal sent his stans into a Valentino frenzy with his black short-shorts, high socks, fire engine red shirt and long matching overcoat. He got Lagerfeld’s signature black tie and combat boots right.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In general, celebrities and designers adhered pretty religiously to the theme, much more than in recent years, sticking closely to the designer’s unwavering vision and signature design codes — tweed, black and white, ribbons, brides, rosettes, cats, suits,” said Madeline Hirsch, news director for InStyle and Byrdie.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was much to play with, she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He had a distinct vision and particular love for all things ‘fancy’ — and it was fun to see what everyone could do in a black and white color palette,” Hirsch said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cassidy Zachary, a fashion historian and host of the podcast “Dressed: The History of Fashion,” put it this way:\n",
      "\n",
      "“While most guests were on theme, I would overall label this year’s red carpet as beautiful but boring. Karl had such an extensive and expansive design vocabulary to pull from and the breadth of his work was overwhelmingly absent. Most guests fell into a Karl Lagerfeld trope trap, largely defined by Chanel and Chanel aesthetics: black and white, camellias, boucle and pearls.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Chanel is not only a fashion house where Lagerfeld worked for 36 years, but was a sponsor of this year’s Met Gala. Lagerfeld’s contributions to fashion history and the modern fashion lexicon, Zachary said, were so much more, though she had some notable exceptions to her criticism.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the highlights of the night was Nicole Kidman, Zachary said, a vision in the pale pink befeathered and bejeweled gown she wore in the 2004 Baz Luhrmann-directed Chanel No. 5 fashion short film. At 180 seconds, it cost $33 million to make, she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were other elegant vintage wins that fueled the Chanel engine: Penélope Cruz in an archival look from the spring 1998 haute couture collection and Jennie Kim in a vintage look from fall 1990.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gala, which raised $17.4 million last year for the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute, is driven by the museum’s spring exhibition each year, this time around called “Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As the show, sure to be a blockbuster, attests, Lagerfeld’s design lexicon extended well beyond his tenure at Chanel. Yet his years at Jean Patou, Balmain and Chloé were barely there or absent on the museum’s Grand Staircase.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gala carpet, Zachary said, would have been more colorful and lively had more guests looked to Lagerfeld’s years at Chloé, where he worked from 1963 to 1983, and again from 1992 to 1997.\n",
      "\n",
      "“His work for Chloé was decidedly more playful, whimsical and surrealist than his work at Chanel, as most famously embodied by his 1983 shower dress and his 1984 violin dress, which was reissued by Chloé in 2013,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zachary was pleased to see all three on the carpet, worn by Vanessa Kirby, Margaret Zhang and Olivia Wilde, respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rubenstein lauded others who went directly to Lagerfeld-related sources: Kidman and Penélope Cruz in vintage Chanel, along with Naomi Campbell’s goddess pink Chanel look from 2010 and Cara Delevingne in a shirt dress from Lagerfeld’s eponymous brand.\n",
      "\n",
      "And he was impressed by the Lagerfeld symbols and silhouettes embodied by Vera Wang for Lily Collins, Loewe for Karlie Kloss, Gucci for Julia Garner and Thom Browne for Jenna Ortega. Still, he said, there were moments that might have made Lagerfeld clench.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t think anyone was out to make a mockery of the night. No one came to be disrespectful. But there were those who evidently didn’t make the attempt to honor the designer’s parameters,” Rubenstein said. “Lagerfeld clothes were never overtly sexy. He rarely showed plunging necklines, backless dresses, lots of midriff or skirts slit to the hip. So those who did show up blatantly showing off with swaths of exposed skin, like Mary J Blige, Jennifer Lopez and Lil Nas X looked awkwardly out of place.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Zachary, too, sees designers who did well by Lagerfeld, blending the honoree’s aesthetic with their own. Anne Hathaway is the shining star of that moment, she said, in custom Versace with founder Gianni’s famous safety pins in a Chanel boucle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sergio Hudson’s form-fitting pink boucle stunner worn by Kiki Palmer honored both Josephine Baker and Lagerfeld’s work in the 1950s, Zachary said. Less subtle was Wang’s massive ballgown for Collins with “Karl” emblazoned across the train.\n",
      "\n",
      "If Collins was less subtle, Jeremy Pope was a bullhorn in a 32-foot cape with a black-and-white Lagerfeld portrait, thanks to Balmain’s Olivier Rousteing.\n",
      "\n",
      "William Middleton, who wrote this year’s biography “Paradise Now: The Extraordinary Life of Karl Lagerfeld,” sees deeper connections to his subject than meet the eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kidman’s dress, for instance: “One of the fittings for this dress, in London at the Dorchester Hotel, was one of the few times in Karl’s life that he showed up on time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Take the note Rihanna and A$ap Rocky (who were 90 minutes late). “She wore a spectacular evening gown by Pier Paolo Piccioli, who had worked with Karl at Fendi, fusing his Valentino aesthetic with Karl’s, particularly with the oversized camellias,” Middleton said. “And he was wearing a kilt-like skirt with a black jacket, by Gucci, like Karl had worn in Tokyo in 2004.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Fans who raved on social media clearly considered the couple worth waiting for.\n",

Un [Google Drive directory](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RNXtjfaj7-E0-XlfuzSfTpAKPmExop3F/ "Project Directory") of the project.

- Data collection: creation of several accounts, in order to automatically study how different News Media Aggregators provide different type of news to those accounts that differ in terms of combination of factors.
- state-of-art study about bias in news media aggregations.
- Definition of metrics about bias in news media aggregations.
- Identification of bias in news media aggregations.
- Identifications and descriptions of Echo Chambers through qualitative and quantitative techniques.


- Code analysis directory:
  - Analysis directory: it contains three different analysis files: 
  - Leaning Temporal analysis: analysis carried out over 5 days, both for the political profiles of the users and for the general ones. 
   Contains the evolution of news over 5 days, and shows the number of news (for each topic and for each user) for each day, through 
   the use of multi line graphs.
  - News Rate analysis: it contains the analysis of the top 20 news, on different days chosen randomly, for each user and for each topic, 
   through the use of multi bar plots.
  - Positional User analysis: contains the evolution of news, over three days, for users in India. contains the topic position (1, 2, 3, 4) 
   on each day, and compared on multi bar plots.
  - News Media Aggregators API directory: it contains files for the extraction and manage of APIs of different news media aggregators.
  - NLP: it contains files for the NLP analysis and preprocessing of text articles. The automated_preProcessArticle.ipynb contains a system function 
   that, once it receive a list of urls, it produces a list of txt files, one for each article, containing the scores of each text articles (sentiment analysis
   using Stanza library, Vader, MPQA, ...).
   The .tff file is required for the sentiment analysis, and it must stay in the same directory of the file containing the sentiment analysis.
   The hml and json files are generated by the LDA analysis (Gensim-LDA), containing the plot of the LDA analysis that identifies the topic of an article, and 
   generate a model (included on the html file).
- Plotted graph analysis: it contains the plots of the different analysis.

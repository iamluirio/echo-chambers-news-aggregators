"Former Apostolic Nuncio to the United States Accuses Pope of McCarrick Cover - up , Calls on Francis to Resign ",0
"In this tragic moment for the Church in various parts of the world — the United States , Chile , Honduras , Australia , etc ",1
— bishops have a very grave responsibility ,1
"I am thinking in particular of the United States of America , where I was sent as Apostolic Nuncio by Pope Benedict XVI on October 19 , 2011 , the memorial feast of the First North American Martyrs ",0
"The Bishops of the United States are called , and I with them , to follow the example of these first martyrs who brought the Gospel to the lands of America , to be credible witnesses of the immeasurable love of Christ , the Way , the Truth and the Life ",0
"Also , as this is an unprecedented moment in papal history , perhaps the unprecedented step of recalling Benedict XVI to the Chair of St. Peter should also be considered sooner rather than later , before this crisis gets any more out - of - control than it already is ",1
May God save His Church MJM ,0
"So serious is the cover - up that for the good of the Church and protection of the faithful , Archbishop Vigano has called on Pope Francis to resign ",0
"But before Francis resigns , we the Catholic faithful demand that he also remove from the College of Cardinals those who conspired even before the 2013 conclave to make Jorge Mario Bergoglio pope come hell or high water ",0
He and the St. Gallen Group know exactly who they are ,0
"Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò 's 11-page statement , released to the National Catholic Register , accuses Pope Francis of covering for McCarrick , ignoring the sanctions that Pope Benedict had imposed on McCarrick , and also of making McCarrick a trusted counselor who became Francis 's """""""" kingmaker """""""" when it came to American appointments and was highly instrumental in the Pope 's decision to elevate far - Left bishops such as Blase Cupich of Chicago and Joseph Tobin of Newark to the College of Cardinals ",0
Remnant Editor 's Note : This could well mark the beginning of the end of the disastrous pontificate of Pope Francis ,1
The former apostolic nuncio to the United States has accused Francis of repealing sanctions imposed by Pope Benedict XVI on then - Cardinal McCarrick for sexual abuse ,0
"This is a charge most serious , perhaps without precedent in modern times ",1
"Bishops and priests , abusing their authority , have committed horrendous crimes to the detriment of their faithful , minors , innocent victims , and young men eager to offer their lives to the Church , or by their silence have not prevented that such crimes continue to be perpetrated ",1
"To restore the beauty of holiness to the face of the Bride of Christ , which is terribly disfigured by so many abominable crimes , and if we truly want to free the Church from the fetid swamp into which she has fallen , we must have the courage to tear down the culture of secrecy and publicly confess the truths we have kept hidden ",1
"We must tear down the conspiracy of silence with which bishops and priests have protected themselves at the expense of their faithful , a conspiracy of silence that in the eyes of the world risks making the Church look like a sect , a conspiracy of silence not so dissimilar from the one that prevails in the mafia ",1
“ Whatever you have said in the dark ... shall be proclaimed from the housetops ” ( Lk ,0
12:3 ) ,0
"I had always believed and hoped that the hierarchy of the Church could find within itself the spiritual resources and strength to tell the whole truth , to amend and to renew itself ",0
"That is why , even though I had repeatedly been asked to do so , I always avoided making statements to the media , even when it would have been my right to do so , in order to defend myself against the calumnies published about me , even by high - ranking prelates of the Roman Curia ",0
"But now that the corruption has reached the very top of the Church ’s hierarchy , my conscience dictates that I reveal those truths regarding the heart - breaking case of the Archbishop Emeritus of Washington , D.C. , Theodore McCarrick , which I came to know in the course of the duties entrusted to me by St. John Paul II , as Delegate for Pontifical Representations , from 1998 to 2009 , and by Pope Benedict XVI , as Apostolic Nuncio to the United States of America , from October 19 , 2011 until end of May 2016 ",0
"As Delegate for Pontifical Representations in the Secretariat of State , my responsibilities were not limited to the Apostolic Nunciatures , but also included the staff of the Roman Curia ( hires , promotions , informational processes on candidates to the episcopate , etc ",0
) ,0
"and the examination of delicate cases , including those regarding cardinals and bishops , that were entrusted to the Delegate by the Cardinal Secretary of State or by the Substitute of the Secretariat of State ",0
"To dispel suspicions insinuated in several recent articles , I will immediately say that the Apostolic Nuncios in the United States , Gabriel Montalvo and Pietro Sambi , both prematurely deceased , did not fail to inform the Holy See immediately , as soon as they learned of Archbishop McCarrick ’s gravely immoral behavior with seminarians and priests ",1
"Indeed , according to what Nuncio Pietro Sambi wrote , Father Boniface Ramsey , O.P. ’s letter , dated November 22 , 2000 , was written at the request of the late Nuncio Montalvo ",0
"In the letter , Father Ramsey , who had been a professor at the diocesan seminary in Newark from the end of the ’80s until 1996 , affirms that there was a recurring rumor in the seminary that the Archbishop “ shared his bed with seminarians , ” inviting five at a time to spend the weekend with him at his beach house ",0
"And he added that he knew a certain number of seminarians , some of whom were later ordained priests for the Archdiocese of Newark , who had been invited to this beach house and had shared a bed with the Archbishop ",0
"The office that I held at the time was not informed of any measure taken by the Holy See after those charges were brought by Nuncio Montalvo at the end of 2000 , when Cardinal Angelo Sodano was Secretary of State ",0
"Likewise , Nuncio Sambi transmitted to the Cardinal Secretary of State , Tarcisio Bertone , an Indictment Memorandum against McCarrick by the priest Gregory Littleton of the diocese of Charlotte , who was reduced to the lay state for a violation of minors , together with two documents from the same Littleton , in which he recounted his tragic story of sexual abuse by the then - Archbishop of Newark and several other priests and seminarians ",1
"The Nuncio added that Littleton had already forwarded his Memorandum to about twenty people , including civil and ecclesiastical judicial authorities , police and lawyers , in June 2006 , and that it was therefore very likely that the news would soon be made public ",0
He therefore called for a prompt intervention by the Holy See ,0
"In writing up a memo[1 ] on these documents that were entrusted to me , as Delegate for Pontifical Representations , on December 6 , 2006 , I wrote to my superiors , Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone and the Substitute Leonardo Sandri , that the facts attributed to McCarrick by Littleton were of such gravity and vileness as to provoke bewilderment , a sense of disgust , deep sorrow and bitterness in the reader , and that they constituted the crimes of seducing , requesting depraved acts of seminarians and priests , repeatedly and simultaneously with several people , derision of a young seminarian who tried to resist the Archbishop ’s seductions in the presence of two other priests , absolution of the accomplices in these depraved acts , sacrilegious celebration of the Eucharist with the same priests after committing such acts ",1
"In my memo , which I delivered on that same December 6 , 2006 to my direct superior , the Substitute Leonardo Sandri , I proposed the following considerations and course of action to my superiors : ",0
"- Given that it seemed a new scandal of particular gravity , as it regarded a cardinal , was going to be added to the many scandals for the Church in the United States , ",0
"1405 § 1 , No ",0
"2˚ , “ ipsius Romani Pontificis dumtaxat ius est iudicandi ” ; ",0
"I added that it would be salutary if , for once , ecclesiastical authority would intervene before the civil authorities and , if possible , before the scandal had broken out in the press ",0
This could have restored some dignity to a Church so sorely tried and humiliated by so many abominable acts on the part of some pastors ,0
"If this were done , the civil authority would no longer have to judge a cardinal , but a pastor with whom the Church had already taken appropriate measures to prevent the cardinal from abusing his authority and continuing to destroy innocent victims ",1
"My memo of December 6 , 2006 was kept by my superiors , and was never returned to me with any actual decision by the superiors on this matter ",0
"Subsequently , around April 21 - 23 , 2008 , the Statement for Pope Benedict XVI about the pattern of sexual abuse crisis in the United States , by Richard Sipe , was published on the internet , at richardsipe.com ",0
"On April 24 , it was passed on by the Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , Cardinal William Levada , to the Cardinal Secretary of State Tarcisio Bertone ",0
"It was delivered to me one month later , on May 24 , 2008 ",0
"The following day , I delivered a new memo to the new Substitute , Fernando Filoni , which included my previous one of December 6 , 2006 ",0
"In it , I summarized Richard Sipe ’s document , which ended with this respectful and heartfelt appeal to Pope Benedict XVI : “ I approach Your Holiness with due reverence , but with the same intensity that motivated Peter Damian to lay out before your predecessor , Pope Leo IX , a description of the condition of the clergy during his time ",0
The problems he spoke of are similar and as great now in the United States as they were then in Rome ,0
"If Your Holiness requests , I will personally submit to you documentation of that about which I have spoken ",0
"I ended my memo by repeating to my superiors that I thought it was necessary to intervene as soon as possible by removing the cardinal ’s hat from Cardinal McCarrick and that he should be subjected to the sanctions established by the Code of Canon Law , which also provide for reduction to the lay state ",0
"This second memo of mine was also never returned to the Personnel Office , and I was greatly dismayed at my superiors for the inconceivable absence of any measure against the Cardinal , and for the continuing lack of any communication with me since my first memo in December 2006 ",1
"But finally I learned with certainty , through Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re , then - Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops , that Richard Sipe ’s courageous and meritorious Statement had had the desired result ",1
"Pope Benedict had imposed on Cardinal McCarrick sanctions similar to those now imposed on him by Pope Francis : the Cardinal was to leave the seminary where he was living , he was forbidden to celebrate [ Mass ] in public , to participate in public meetings , to give lectures , to travel , with the obligation of dedicating himself to a life of prayer and penance ",0
"I do not know when Pope Benedict took these measures against McCarrick , whether in 2009 or 2010 , because in the meantime I had been transferred to the Governorate of Vatican City State , just as I do not know who was responsible for this incredible delay ",1
"I certainly do not believe it was Pope Benedict , who as Cardinal had repeatedly denounced the corruption present in the Church , and in the first months of his pontificate had already taken a firm stand against the admission into seminary of young men with deep homosexual tendencies ",0
"I believe it was due to the Pope ’s first collaborator at the time , Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone , who notoriously favored promoting homosexuals into positions of responsibility , and was accustomed to managing the information he thought appropriate to convey to the Pope ",0
"In any case , what is certain is that Pope Benedict imposed the above canonical sanctions on McCarrick and that they were communicated to him by the Apostolic Nuncio to the United States , Pietro Sambi ",0
"Monsignor Jean - François Lantheaume , then first Counsellor of the Nunciature in Washington and Chargé d'Affaires a.i ",0
"after the unexpected death of Nuncio Sambi in Baltimore , told me when I arrived in Washington — and he is ready to testify to it— about a stormy conversation , lasting over an hour , that Nuncio Sambi had with Cardinal McCarrick whom he had summoned to the Nunciature ",0
Monsignor Lantheaume told me that “ the Nuncio ’s voice could be heard all the way out in the corridor ,0
"Pope Benedict ’s same dispositions were then also communicated to me by the new Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops , Cardinal Marc Ouellet , in November 2011 , in a conversation before my departure for Washington , and were included among the instructions of the same Congregation to the new Nuncio ",0
"In turn , I repeated them to Cardinal McCarrick at my first meeting with him at the Nunciature ",0
"The Cardinal , muttering in a barely comprehensible way , admitted that he had perhaps made the mistake of sleeping in the same bed with some seminarians at his beach house , but he said this as if it had no importance ",0
"The faithful insistently wonder how it was possible for him to be appointed to Washington , and as Cardinal , and they have every right to know who knew , and who covered up his grave misdeeds ",1
"It is therefore my duty to reveal what I know about this , beginning with the Roman Curia ",0
Cardinal Angelo Sodano was Secretary of State until September 2006 : all information was communicated to him ,0
"In November 2000 , Nunzio Montalvo sent him his report , passing on to him the aforementioned letter from Father Boniface Ramsey in which he denounced the serious abuses committed by McCarrick ",0
It is known that Sodano tried to cover up the Father Maciel scandal to the end ,0
"He even removed the Nuncio in Mexico City , Justo Mullor , who refused to be an accomplice in his scheme to cover Maciel , and in his place appointed Sandri , then - Nuncio to Venezuela , who was willing to collaborate in the cover - up ",0
"Sodano even went so far as to issue a statement to the Vatican press office in which a falsehood was affirmed , that is , that Pope Benedict had decided that the Maciel case should be considered closed ",0
"Benedict reacted , despite Sodano ’s strenuous defense , and Maciel was found guilty and irrevocably condemned ",0
"Was McCarrick ’s appointment to Washington and as Cardinal the work of Sodano , when John Paul II was already very ill ? ",0
We are not given to know ,0
"However , it is legitimate to think so , but I do not think he was the only one responsible for this ",0
"McCarrick frequently went to Rome and made friends everywhere , at all levels of the Curia ",0
"If Sodano had protected Maciel , as seems certain , there is no reason why he would n’t have done so for McCarrick , who according to many had the financial means to influence decisions ",0
"His nomination to Washington was opposed by then - Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops , Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re ",0
"At the Nunciature in Washington there is a note , written in his hand , in which Cardinal Re disassociates himself from the appointment and states that McCarrick was 14th on the list for Washington ",0
"Nuncio Sambi ’s report , with all the attachments , was sent to Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone , as Secretary of State ",0
"My two above - mentioned memos of December 6 , 2006 and May 25 , 2008 , were also presumably handed over to him by the Substitute ",0
"As already mentioned , the Cardinal had no difficulty in insistently presenting for the episcopate candidates known to be active homosexuals — I cite only the well - known case of Vincenzo de Mauro , who was appointed Archbishop - Bishop of Vigevano and later removed because he was undermining his seminarians — and in filtering and manipulating the information he conveyed to Pope Benedict ",0
"Cardinal Pietro Parolin , the current Secretary of State , was also complicit in covering up the misdeeds of McCarrick who had , after the election of Pope Francis , boasted openly of his travels and missions to various continents ",0
"In April 2014 , the Washington Times had a front page report on McCarrick ’s trip to the Central African Republic , and on behalf of the State Department no less ",0
"As Nuncio to Washington , I wrote to Cardinal Parolin asking him if the sanctions imposed on McCarrick by Pope Benedict were still valid ",0
Ça va sans dire that my letter never received any reply ! ,0
"The same can be said for Cardinal William Levada , former Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , for Cardinals Marc Ouellet , Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops , Lorenzo Baldisseri , former Secretary of the same Congregation for Bishops , and Archbishop Ilson de Jesus Montanari , current Secretary of the same Congregation ",0
They were all aware by reason of their office of the sanctions imposed by Pope Benedict on McCarrick ,0
"Cardinals Leonardo Sandri , Fernando Filoni and Angelo Becciu , as Substitutes of the Secretariat of State , knew in every detail the situation regarding Cardinal McCarrick ",0
Nor could Cardinals Giovanni Lajolo and Dominique Mamberti have failed to know ,0
"As Secretaries for Relations with States , they participated several times a week in collegial meetings with the Secretary of State ",0
"As far as the Roman Curia is concerned , for the moment I will stop here , even if the names of other prelates in the Vatican are well known , even some very close to Pope Francis , such as Cardinal Francesco Coccopalmerio and Archbishop Vincenzo Paglia , who belong to the homosexual current in favor of subverting Catholic doctrine on homosexuality , a current already denounced in 1986 by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger , then - Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , in the Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons ",0
"Cardinals Edwin Frederick O’Brien and Renato Raffaele Martino also belong to the same current , albeit with a different ideology ",0
Others belonging to this current even reside at the Domus Sanctae Marthae ,0
Now to the United States ,0
"Obviously , the first to have been informed of the measures taken by Pope Benedict was McCarrick ’s successor in Washington See , Cardinal Donald Wuerl , whose situation is now completely compromised by the recent revelations regarding his behavior as Bishop of Pittsburgh ",0
"It is absolutely unthinkable that Nunzio Sambi , who was an extremely responsible person , loyal , direct and explicit in his way of being ( a true son of Romagna ) did not speak to him about it ",0
"In any case , I myself brought up the subject with Cardinal Wuerl on several occasions , and I certainly did n’t need to go into detail because it was immediately clear to me that he was fully aware of it ",0
"I also remember in particular the fact that I had to draw his attention to it , because I realized that in an archdiocesan publication , on the back cover in color , there was an announcement inviting young men who thought they had a vocation to the priesthood to a meeting with Cardinal McCarrick ",0
"I immediately phoned Cardinal Wuerl , who expressed his surprise to me , telling me that he knew nothing about that announcement and that he would cancel it ",0
"If , as he now continues to state , he knew nothing of the abuses committed by McCarrick and the measures taken by Pope Benedict , how can his answer be explained ? ",0
"His recent statements that he knew nothing about it , even though at first he cunningly referred to compensation for the two victims , are absolutely laughable ",1
"The Cardinal lies shamelessly and prevails upon his Chancellor , Monsignor Antonicelli , to lie as well ",1
Cardinal Wuerl also clearly lied on another occasion ,0
"Following a morally unacceptable event authorized by the academic authorities of Georgetown University , I brought it to the attention of its President , Dr. John DeGioia , sending him two subsequent letters ",0
"Before forwarding them to the addressee , so as to handle things properly , I personally gave a copy of them to the Cardinal with an accompanying letter I had written ",0
The Cardinal told me that he knew nothing about it ,0
"However , he failed to acknowledge receipt of my two letters , contrary to what he customarily did ",0
I subsequently learned that the event at Georgetown had taken place for seven years ,0
But the Cardinal knew nothing about it ! ,0
"Cardinal Wuerl , well aware of the continuous abuses committed by Cardinal McCarrick and the sanctions imposed on him by Pope Benedict , transgressing the Pope ’s order , also allowed him to reside at a seminary in Washington D.C. ",0
"In doing so , he put other seminarians at risk ",0
"Bishop Paul Bootkoski , emeritus of Metuchen , and Archbishop John Myers , emeritus of Newark , covered up the abuses committed by McCarrick in their respective dioceses and compensated two of his victims ",0
They can not deny it and they must be interrogated in order to reveal every circumstance and all responsibility regarding this matter ,0
"Cardinal Kevin Farrell , who was recently interviewed by the media , also said that he did n’t have the slightest idea about the abuses committed by McCarrick ",0
"Given his tenure in Washington , Dallas and now Rome , I think no one can honestly believe him ",0
I do n’t know if he was ever asked if he knew about Maciel ’s crimes ,0
"If he were to deny this , would anybody believe him given that he occupied positions of responsibility as a member of the Legionaries of Christ ? ",0
"Regarding Cardinal Sean O’Malley , I would simply say that his latest statements on the McCarrick case are disconcerting , and have totally obscured his transparency and credibility ",1
"My conscience requires me also to reveal facts that I have experienced personally , concerning Pope Francis , that have a dramatic significance , which as Bishop , sharing the collegial responsibility of all the bishops for the universal Church , do not allow me to remain silent , and that I state here , ready to reaffirm them under oath by calling on God as my witness ",1
"In the last months of his pontificate , Pope Benedict XVI had convened a meeting of all the apostolic nuncios in Rome , as Paul VI and St. John Paul II had done on several occasions ",0
"The date set for the audience with the Pope was Friday , June 21 , 2013 ",0
Pope Francis kept this commitment made by his predecessor ,0
Of course I also came to Rome from Washington ,0
"It was my first meeting with the new Pope elected only three months prior , after the resignation of Pope Benedict ",0
"On the morning of Thursday , June 20 , 2013 , I went to the Domus Sanctae Marthae , to join my colleagues who were staying there ",0
"As soon as I entered the hall I met Cardinal McCarrick , who wore the red - trimmed cassock ",0
I greeted him respectfully as I had always done ,0
"He immediately said to me , in a tone somewhere between ambiguous and triumphant : “ The Pope received me yesterday , tomorrow I am going to China ",0
” ,0
"At the time I knew nothing of his long friendship with Cardinal Bergoglio and of the important part he had played in his recent election , as McCarrick himself would later reveal in a lecture at Villanova University and in an interview with the National Catholic Reporter ",0
"Nor had I ever thought of the fact that he had participated in the preliminary meetings of the recent conclave , and of the role he had been able to have as a cardinal elector in the 2005 conclave ",0
"Therefore I did not immediately grasp the meaning of the encrypted message that McCarrick had communicated to me , but that would become clear to me in the days immediately following ",0
The next day the audience with Pope Francis took place ,0
"After his address , which was partly read and partly delivered off the cuff , the Pope wished to greet all the nuncios one by one ",0
"In single file , I remember that I was among the last ",0
"When it was my turn , I just had time to say to him , “ I am the Nuncio to the United States ",0
"” He immediately assailed me with a tone of reproach , using these words : “ The Bishops in the United States must not be ideologized ! ",0
They must be shepherds!”Of course I was not in a position to ask for explanations about the meaning of his words and the aggressive way in which he had upbraided me ,1
"I had in my hand a book in Portuguese that Cardinal O’Malley had sent me for the Pope a few days earlier , telling me “ so he could go over his Portuguese before going to Rio for World Youth Day ",0
"” I handed it to him immediately , and so freed myself from that extremely disconcerting and embarrassing situation ",0
At the end of the audience the Pope announced : “ Those of you who are still in Rome next Sunday are invited to concelebrate with me at the Domus Sanctae Marthae ,0
” I naturally thought of staying on to clarify as soon as possible what the Pope intended to tell me ,0
"On Sunday June 23 , before the concelebration with the Pope , I asked Monsignor Ricca , who as the person in charge of the house helped us put on the vestments , if he could ask the Pope if he could receive me sometime in the following week ",0
How could I have returned to Washington without having clarified what the Pope wanted of me ? ,0
"At the end of Mass , while the Pope was greeting the few lay people present , Monsignor Fabian Pedacchio , his Argentine secretary , came to me and said : “ The Pope told me to ask if you are free now ! ” Naturally , I replied that I was at the Pope ’s disposal and that I thanked him for receiving me immediately ",0
The Pope took me to the first floor in his apartment and said : “ We have 40 minutes before the Angelus ,0
” ,0
"I began the conversation , asking the Pope what he intended to say to me with the words he had addressed to me when I greeted him the previous Friday ",0
"And the Pope , in a very different , friendly , almost affectionate tone , said to me : “ Yes , the Bishops in the United States must not be ideologized , they must not be right - wing like the Archbishop of Philadelphia , ( the Pope did not give me the name of the Archbishop ) they must be shepherds ; and they must not be left - wing — and he added , raising both arms — and when I say left - wing I mean homosexual ",0
"” Of course , the logic of the correlation between being left - wing and being homosexual escaped me , but I added nothing else ",0
"Immediately after , the Pope asked me in a deceitful way : “ What is Cardinal McCarrick like ? ” I answered him with complete frankness and , if you want , with great naiveté : “ Holy Father , I do n’t know if you know Cardinal McCarrick , but if you ask the Congregation for Bishops there is a dossier this thick about him ",0
He corrupted generations of seminarians and priests and Pope Benedict ordered him to withdraw to a life of prayer and penance ,0
"” The Pope did not make the slightest comment about those very grave words of mine and did not show any expression of surprise on his face , as if he had already known the matter for some time , and he immediately changed the subject ",1
"But then , what was the Pope ’s purpose in asking me that question : “ What is Cardinal McCarrick like ? ” He clearly wanted to find out if I was an ally of McCarrick or not ",0
"Back in Washington everything became very clear to me , thanks also to a new event that occurred only a few days after my meeting with Pope Francis ",0
"When the new Bishop Mark Seitz took possession of the Diocese of El Paso on July 9 , 2013 , I sent the first Counsellor , Monsignor Jean - François Lantheaume , while I went to Dallas that same day for an international meeting on Bioethics ",0
"When he got back , Monsignor Lantheaume told me that in El Paso he had met Cardinal McCarrick who , taking him aside , told him almost the same words that the Pope had said to me in Rome : “ the Bishops in the United States must not be ideologized , they must not be right - wing , they must be shepherds … ",0
” I was astounded ! ,0
"It was therefore clear that the words of reproach that Pope Francis had addressed to me on June 21 , 2013 had been put into his mouth the day before by Cardinal McCarrick ",0
"Also the Pope ’s mention “ not like the Archbishop of Philadelphia ” could be traced to McCarrick , because there had been a strong disagreement between the two of them about the admission to Communion of pro - abortion politicians ",0
"In his communication to the bishops , McCarrick had manipulated a letter of then - Cardinal Ratzinger who prohibited giving them Communion ",0
"Indeed , I also knew how certain Cardinals such as Mahony , Levada and Wuerl , were closely linked to McCarrick ; they had opposed the most recent appointments made by Pope Benedict , for important posts such as Philadelphia , Baltimore , Denver and San Francisco ",0
"Not happy with the trap he had set for me on June 23 , 2013 , when he asked me about McCarrick , only a few months later , in the audience he granted me on October 10 , 2013 , Pope Francis set a second one for me , this time concerning a second of his protégés , Cardinal Donald Wuerl ",0
"He asked me : “ What is Cardinal Wuerl like , is he good or bad ? ” I replied , “ Holy Father , I will not tell you if he is good or bad , but I will tell you two facts ",0
"” They are the ones I have already mentioned above , which concern Wuerl ’s pastoral carelessness regarding the aberrant deviations at Georgetown University and the invitation by the Archdiocese of Washington to young aspirants to the priesthood to a meeting with McCarrick ! ",1
Once again the Pope did not show any reaction ,0
"It was also clear that , from the time of Pope Francis ’s election , McCarrick , now free from all constraints , had felt free to travel continuously , to give lectures and interviews ",0
"In a team effort with Cardinal Rodriguez Maradiaga , he had become the kingmaker for appointments in the Curia and the United States , and the most listened to advisor in the Vatican for relations with the Obama administration ",0
"This is how one explains that , as members of the Congregation for Bishops , the Pope replaced Cardinal Burke with Wuerl and immediately appointed Cupich right after he was made a cardinal ",0
With these appointments the Nunciature in Washington was now out of the picture in the appointment of bishops ,0
"In addition , he appointed the Brazilian Ilson de Jesus Montanari — the great friend of his private Argentine secretary Fabian Pedacchio — as Secretary of the same Congregation for Bishops and Secretary of the College of Cardinals , promoting him in one single leap from a simple official of that department to Archbishop Secretary ",0
Something unprecedented for such an important position ! ,1
"The appointments of Blase Cupich to Chicago and Joseph W. Tobin to Newark were orchestrated by McCarrick , Maradiaga and Wuerl , united by a wicked pact of abuses by the first , and at least of coverup of abuses by the other two ",1
Their names were not among those presented by the Nunciature for Chicago and Newark ,0
"Regarding Cupich , one can not fail to note his ostentatious arrogance , and the insolence with which he denies the evidence that is now obvious to all : that 80 % of the abuses found were committed against young adults by homosexuals who were in a relationship of authority over their victims ",1
"During the speech he gave when he took possession of the Chicago See , at which I was present as a representative of the Pope , Cupich quipped that one certainly should not expect the new Archbishop to walk on water ",0
"Perhaps it would be enough for him to be able to remain with his feet on the ground and not try to turn reality upside - down , blinded by his pro - gay ideology , as he stated in a recent interview with America Magazine ",0
"Extolling his particular expertise in the matter , having been President of the Committee on Protection of Children and Young People of the USCCB , he asserted that the main problem in the crisis of sexual abuse by clergy is not homosexuality , and that affirming this is only a way of diverting attention from the real problem which is clericalism ",0
"In support of this thesis , Cupich “ oddly ” made reference to the results of research carried out at the height of the sexual abuse of minors crisis in the early 2000s , while he “ candidly ” ignored that the results of that investigation were totally denied by the subsequent Independent Reports by the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in 2004 and 2011 , which concluded that , in cases of sexual abuse , 81 % of the victims were male ",0
"In fact , Father Hans Zollner , S.J. , Vice - Rector of the Pontifical Gregorian University , President of the Centre for Child Protection , and Member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors , recently told the newspaper La Stampa that “ in most cases it is a question of homosexual abuse ",0
” ,0
"The appointment of McElroy in San Diego was also orchestrated from above , with an encrypted peremptory order to me as Nuncio , by Cardinal Parolin : “ Reserve the See of San Diego for McElroy ",0
"” McElroy was also well aware of McCarrick ’s abuses , as can be seen from a letter sent to him by Richard Sipe on July 28 , 2016 ",0
"These characters are closely associated with individuals belonging in particular to the deviated wing of the Society of Jesus , unfortunately today a majority , which had already been a cause of serious concern to Paul VI and subsequent pontiffs ",0
"We need only consider Father Robert Drinan , S.J. , who was elected four times to the House of Representatives , and was a staunch supporter of abortion ; or Father Vincent O’Keefe , S.J. , one of the principal promoters of The Land O’Lakes Statement of 1967 , which seriously compromised the Catholic identity of universities and colleges in the United States ",0
"It should be noted that McCarrick , then President of the Catholic University of Puerto Rico , also participated in that inauspicious undertaking which was so harmful to the formation of the consciences of American youth , closely associated as it was with the deviated wing of the Jesuits ",0
"Father James Martin , S.J. , acclaimed by the people mentioned above , in particular Cupich , Tobin , Farrell and McElroy , appointed Consultor of the Secretariat for Communications , well - known activist who promotes the LGBT agenda , chosen to corrupt the young people who will soon gather in Dublin for the World Meeting of Families , is nothing but a sad recent example of that deviated wing of the Society of Jesus ",0
Pope Francis has repeatedly asked for total transparency in the Church and for bishops and faithful to act with parrhesia ,0
The faithful throughout the world also demand this of him in an exemplary manner ,0
"He must honestly state when he first learned about the crimes committed by McCarrick , who abused his authority with seminarians and priests ",0
"In any case , the Pope learned about it from me on June 23 , 2013 and continued to cover for him ",0
He did not take into account the sanctions that Pope Benedict had imposed on him and made him his trusted counselor along with Maradiaga ,0
"The latter [ Maradiaga ] is so confident of the Pope ’s protection that he can dismiss as “ gossip ” the heartfelt appeals of dozens of his seminarians , who found the courage to write to him after one of them tried to commit suicide over homosexual abuse in the seminary ",0
"By now the faithful have well understood Maradiaga ’s strategy : insult the victims to save himself , lie to the bitter end to cover up a chasm of abuses of power , of mismanagement in the administration of Church property , and of financial disasters even against close friends , as in the case of the Ambassador of Honduras Alejandro Valladares , former Dean of the Diplomatic Corps to the Holy See ",1
"In the case of the former Auxiliary Bishop Juan José Pineda , after the article published in the [ Italian ] weekly L’Espresso last February , Maradiaga stated in the newspaper Avvenire : “ It was my auxiliary bishop Pineda who asked for the visitation , so as to ‘ clear’ his name after being subjected to much slander ",0
"” Now , regarding Pineda the only thing that has been made public is that his resignation has simply been accepted , thus making any possible responsibility of his and Maradiaga vanish into nowhere ",0
"In the name of the transparency so hailed by the Pope , the report that the Visitator , Argentine bishop Alcides Casaretto , delivered more than a year ago only and directly to the Pope , must be made public ",0
"Finally , the recent appointment as Substitute of Archbishop Edgar Peña Parra is also connected with Honduras , that is , with Maradiaga ",0
From 2003 to 2007 Peña Parra worked as Counsellor at the Tegucigalpa Nunciature ,0
As Delegate for Pontifical Representations I received worrisome information about him ,0
"In Honduras , a scandal as huge as the one in Chile is about to be repeated ",0
"The Pope defends his man , Cardinal Rodriguez Maradiaga , to the bitter end , as he had done in Chile with Bishop Juan de la Cruz Barros , whom he himself had appointed Bishop of Osorno against the advice of the Chilean Bishops ",0
First he insulted the abuse victims ,0
"Then , only when he was forced by the media , and a revolt by the Chilean victims and faithful , did he recognize his error and apologize , while stating that he had been misinformed , causing a disastrous situation for the Church in Chile , but continuing to protect the two Chilean Cardinals Errazuriz and Ezzati ",1
"Even in the tragic affair of McCarrick , Pope Francis ’s behavior was no different ",0
"He knew from at least June 23 , 2013 that McCarrick was a serial predator ",1
"Although he knew that he was a corrupt man , he covered for him to the bitter end ; indeed , he made McCarrick ’s advice his own , which was certainly not inspired by sound intentions and for love of the Church ",0
"It was only when he was forced by the report of the abuse of a minor , again on the basis of media attention , that he took action [ regarding McCarrick ] to save his image in the media ",0
"Now in the United States a chorus of voices is rising especially from the lay faithful , and has recently been joined by several bishops and priests , asking that all those who , by their silence , covered up McCarrick ’s criminal behavior , or who used him to advance their career or promote their intentions , ambitions and power in the Church , should resign ",0
But this will not be enough to heal the situation of extremely grave immoral behavior by the clergy : bishops and priests ,1
A time of conversion and penance must be proclaimed ,0
The virtue of chastity must be recovered in the clergy and in seminaries ,0
Corruption in the misuse of the Church ’s resources and of the offerings of the faithful must be fought against ,0
The seriousness of homosexual behavior must be denounced ,0
"The homosexual networks present in the Church must be eradicated , as Janet Smith , Professor of Moral Theology at the Sacred Heart Major Seminary in Detroit , recently wrote ",0
"“ The problem of clergy abuse , ” she wrote , “ can not be resolved simply by the resignation of some bishops , and even less so by bureaucratic directives ",0
The deeper problem lies in homosexual networks within the clergy which must be eradicated ,0
"” These homosexual networks , which are now widespread in many dioceses , seminaries , religious orders , etc ",0
", act under the concealment of secrecy and lies with the power of octopus tentacles , and strangle innocent victims and priestly vocations , and are strangling the entire Church ",0
"I implore everyone , especially Bishops , to speak up in order to defeat this conspiracy of silence that is so widespread , and to report the cases of abuse they know about to the media and civil authorities ",0
Let us heed the most powerful message that St. John Paul II left us as an inheritance : Do not be afraid ! ,1
Do not be afraid ! ,1
"In his 2008 homily on the Feast of the Epiphany , Pope Benedict reminded us that the Father ’s plan of salvation had been fully revealed and realized in the mystery of Christ ’s death and resurrection , but it needs to be welcomed in human history , which is always a history of fidelity on God ’s part and unfortunately also of infidelity on the part of us men ",0
"The Church , the depositary of the blessing of the New Covenant , signed in the blood of the Lamb , is holy but made up of sinners , as Saint Ambrose wrote : the Church is “ immaculata ex maculatis , ” she is holy and spotless even though , in her earthly journey , she is made up of men stained with sin ",1
"I want to recall this indefectible truth of the Church ’s holiness to the many people who have been so deeply scandalized by the abominable and sacrilegious behavior of the former Archbishop of Washington , Theodore McCarrick ; by the grave , disconcerting and sinful conduct of Pope Francis and by the conspiracy of silence of so many pastors , and who are tempted to abandon the Church , disfigured by so many ignominies ",1
"At the Angelus on Sunday , August 12 , 2018 Pope Francis said these words : “ Everyone is guilty for the good he could have done and did not do ... ",0
"If we do not oppose evil , we tacitly feed it ",0
We need to intervene where evil is spreading ; for evil spreads where daring Christians who oppose evil with good are lacking ,0
"” If this is rightly to be considered a serious moral responsibility for every believer , how much graver is it for the Church ’s supreme pastor , who in the case of McCarrick not only did not oppose evil but associated himself in doing evil with someone he knew to be deeply corrupt ",0
"He followed the advice of someone he knew well to be a pervert , thus multiplying exponentially with his supreme authority the evil done by McCarrick ",1
And how many other evil pastors is Francis still continuing to prop up in their active destruction of the Church ! ,0
Francis is abdicating the mandate which Christ gave to Peter to confirm the brethren ,0
"Indeed , by his action he has divided them , led them into error , and encouraged the wolves to continue to tear apart the sheep of Christ ’s flock ",0
"In this extremely dramatic moment for the universal Church , he must acknowledge his mistakes and , in keeping with the proclaimed principle of zero tolerance , Pope Francis must be the first to set a good example for cardinals and bishops who covered up McCarrick ’s abuses and resign along with all of them ",0
"Even in dismay and sadness over the enormity of what is happening , let us not lose hope ! ",0
We well know that the great majority of our pastors live their priestly vocation with fidelity and dedication ,0
It is in moments of great trial that the Lord ’s grace is revealed in abundance and makes His limitless mercy available to all ; but it is granted only to those who are truly repentant and sincerely propose to amend their lives ,0
"This is a favorable time for the Church to confess her sins , to convert , and to do penance ",0
"Let us all pray for the Church and for the Pope , let us remember how many times he has asked us to pray for him ! ",0
"Let us all renew faith in the Church our Mother : “ I believe in one , holy , catholic and apostolic Church ! ” ",0
Christ will never abandon His Church ! ,0
He generated her in His Blood and continually revives her with His Spirit ! ,0
"Mary , Mother of the Church , pray for us ! ",1
"Mary , Virgin and Queen , Mother of the King of glory , pray for us ! ",1

A colossal Neptunian storm just vanished before our eyes ,0
"You do n’t have to look far for fresh news about Mars , Saturn , or Jupiter these days , but Neptune does n’t always get the same kind of attention ",0
The big frigid blue ball is the farthest planet from the Sun — since we do n’t count Pluto as a planet anymore — and it has n’t been studied with the same intensity of many of the others ,0
"Thankfully the Hubble Space Telescope has n’t lost interest in the distant planet , because it just captured one of Neptunes massive storms losing steam as it roars across the planet ",0
"Storms on Neptune appear as giant dark ovals , a bit like Jupiter ’s Great Red Spot ",0
"However , unlike Jupiter ’s centuries - old storm , Neptune ’s hurricane - like weather events only last a few years at a time before eventually dissipating ",0
"Of course , that ’s not to say the storms are insignificant — many are large enough to swallow and entire continent here on Earth — so watching one breathe its dying gasps is still a special sight ",1
"The planet , which NASA says is the windiest in our Solar System , hosts regular storms which appear as large spots on its surface , but scientists are still at a loss as to how they actually occur ",0
"“ We have no evidence of how these vortices are formed or how fast they rotate , ” Agustín Sánchez - Lavega of the University of the Basque Country in Spain explains ",0
“ It is most likely that they arise from an instability in the sheared eastward and westward winds ,0
” ,0
The observation of this particular storm dying out is significant because it ’s the very first time one of Neptune ’s storms has been observed in such a way ,0
It also goes against everything that scientists thought they knew about how forms on Neptune live and die ,0
"“ It looks like we ’re capturing the demise of this dark vortex , and it ’s different from what well - known studies led us to expect , ” said Michael H. Wong of the University of California at Berkeley says ",0
“ Their dynamical simulations said that anticyclones under Neptune ’s wind shear would probably drift toward the equator ,0
"We thought that once the vortex got too close to the equator , it would break up and perhaps create a spectacular outburst of cloud activity ",0
” ,0
"But this storm stayed its course , dying out in a horizontal path that did n’t bring it towards the Neptunian equator at all , forcing scientists to go back to the drawing board and come up with a new theory on the planet ’s weather habits ",0
Newly Released Private Surveillance Footage From The Las Vegas Massacre Shows “ Helicopter Hovering Overhead ” During The Attack ,0
"Newly released footage of the Las Vegas Massacre , captured by a private surveillance camera and recently released by Fox News host Tucker Carlson , has once again ignited the theory that helicopters were used during the horrific attack ",0
"Over the last month multiple videos have been released that many believe show helicopters either conducting an attack on the Vegas Strip or attempting to stop those that were and now , with this latest evidence release , that possibility seems all the more plausible ",0
"As Shepard Ambellas reported for Intellihub , “ The [ footage ] is presumed to have been captured by a nearby business ’s southward facing security camera which is located approximately 780 feet due east of the venue where the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival was held on Oct. 1 ",0
The tape was given to Fox News by an attorney who represents several shooting victims ,0
” ,0
"Amazingly , the surveillance camera captured what seems to show a “ large amount ” of wind and debris being kicked up by a nearby helicopter hovering above the attack and or taking part in it ",1
"“ Astonishingly , between the times of 10:13 and 10:16 a good amount of debris can be seen being pushed downward and sideways in front of the camera , ” Ambellas continued ",0
"“ By 10:14 much larger crowds of people can be seen streaming through the area to escape the massacre going on , ” Carlson reported ",0
"“ You can see a large amount of wind and debris , apparently that is due to a helicopter hovering overhead ",0
” ,0
"The footage goes how to show two men attempt to help a victim who had apparently been shot , eventually resorting to covering up the body after they realized it was simply too late ",0
Ambellas also reported on what his research indicates were documented helicopters in the air at the time ,0
"A quick review of flight records during that time reveals that a squadron of EC-130 Eurocopters departed from Maverick Leasing LLC at 10:12 p.m. , several of which appear to have overflown the parking lot where the victim and debris were seen ",0
"However , the departure of the choppers and the fact that several of them overflew the parking lot does not explain all of the debris being kicked up from by a heavy downdraft , prop wash , possibly from a helicopter hovering in place much closer ",0
"In fact , the downdraft appears to be constant from 10:13 - 10:16 p.m. and not intermittent as if several choppers had just passed overhead ",0
"As I have reported in the past , multiple other videos taken on the night of the attack also seem to point to helicopters being used throughout the city ",0
"“ Footage has emerged that may show muzzle flashes coming from the helicopter in what looks to be evidence that a team was firing into the crowd from the air on that fateful night , ” read a report in The Daily Sheeple ",0
"“ Despite claims by some that these are “ strobes ” it remains unlikely that this is the case , especially when you consider other footage of the helicopter taken on the night as well as research by a group of investigators who believe the first attack on October 1st was carried out from the air ",1
” ,0
It is also important to keep in mind that there is footage of a still unidentified team loading up gear in a helicopter near the scene of the attack ,0
“ In what can only be described as a “ WTF video ” the following footage seems to literally show a team of unknown soldiers gearing up next to a helicopter near the Route 91 concert ,1
” ,0
"Additionally , Carlson also noted during the initial broadcast of the private surveillance footage that the owner of the camera was never approached by the FBI , who have so far never seen the footage , much less investigated it ",0
"While we may never know what actually happened during the Las Vegas Massacre , the fact remains that the official story has been proven , time and time again , to be absolutely false and in fact nothing more than a pathetic attempt at a cover - up ",1
"Congo confirms 2 Ebola cases , declares outbreak ",0
"KINSHASA , Congo -- Congo 's government on Tuesday declared a new outbreak of Ebola in the country 's rural northwest , after two cases of the deadly virus were confirmed in Bikoro ",0
"Congo 's Health Ministry said that of five samples sent to the National Institute of Biological Research in Kinshasa , two were positive for the Zaire strain of Ebola in the country 's Equateur province ",0
"The samples were gathered after the Equateur province Health Ministry notified Kinshasa on May 3 of some 21 cases of a hemorrhagic fever in the Ikoko Impenge area , including 17 deaths , according to the World Health Organization and Congo 's government ",0
There are various hemorrhagic fevers ,0
A team was sent by the WHO and Doctors Without Borders over the weekend to investigate and strengthen coordination ,0
"The five new cases were then identified and sent to the laboratory , Congo 's government said ",0
"Since that time , no deaths have been reported among those hospitalized or among health workers treating the ill , it said ",0
"A team of experts will go to Bikoro today to implement measures to avoid further spread of the disease , said the ministry statement ",0
"The team also will investigate how the outbreak first started , it said ",0
"This is the ninth Ebola outbreak in Congo since 1976 , when the disease was first identified ",0
"Congo has a long track record with Ebola , the World Health Organization said ",0
The most recent outbreak was in May 2017 and killed four of the eight people infected in Congo 's Bas - Uele province in the northeast ,0
That outbreak was quickly contained and was declared over in July ,0
"None of these outbreaks was connected to the outbreak in Guinea , Liberia and Sierra Leone that began in 2014 and left more than 11,300 people dead ",0
"Ebola occasionally jumps to humans from animals , including bats and monkeys ",0
"Without preventive measures , the virus can spread quickly between people and is fatal in up to 90 percent of cases ",0
"There is no specific treatment for Ebola , which is spread through the bodily fluids of people exhibiting symptoms ",0
"A new experimental vaccine has been shown to be effective against the virus , though quantities are currently limited ",0
WHO said Tuesday that it is working closely with Congo 's government to rapidly scale up its operations and mobilize health partners as it did successfully in Congo last year ,0

"Hungarian Prime Minister Hits Nail On The Head : Refugees Are Actually """""""" Muslim Invaders """""""" ",1
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban does n't mince words when it comes to the Muslim invasion in Europe and specifically to his own country ,1
"Orban says there is not only Muslim invaders in the mix of """""""" refugees , """""""" but also “ economic migrants """""""" seeking better lives for themselves ",1
"Indeed , both of these are true ",0
"There are plenty of these people who are simply happy to have a place to live after many were driven from their homes due to the US , Russia and other countries putting their noses where they did n't belong and funding , training and arming Islamic jihadis there ",1
"Then , there are those who clearly come to the country to Islamasize the country because they have an Islamic dominionist attitude borne of the teachings of the Koran and Muhammad ",1
RT reports : ,0
"Refugees in Europe are just “ Muslim invaders ” and economic migrants seeking better lives , Hungarian PM Viktor Orban has said , adding that the large number of Muslims in the EU had led to the appearance of ‘ parallel societies.’ Asked in an interview with the German Bild newspaper why Budapest does not want to accept any refugees , Orban replied : “ We do n’t consider these people to be Muslim refugees ",1
"” Instead , the tough - talking politician said they were regarded as “ Muslim invaders ",1
"” Asylum seekers must cross four countries to reach Hungary from Syria , all of which are not as rich as Germany but are economically stable , the PM said ",0
"He was apparently referring to Turkey , Greece , Macedonia and Serbia – a common route for migrants heading for ‘ wealthy’ Europe ",0
"“ So , they are not running for their lives [ in these countries ] ",0
"They are merely economic migrants seeking a better life , ” Orban concluded ",0
"He stressed though , that he can only speak for the Hungarians and they “ do n’t want ” immigration ",1
"In his view , the government simply ca n’t go against the will of the people ",0
"And Orban has stayed the course , too while governments like that of Germany have ignored their people to allow for a clear invasion of Germany that has led to untold numbers of sexual assaults by Muslim migrants , attacks on Christians and there 's no telling the amount of damage to the unethical welfare system in the country ",1
RT continues : ,0
"Going further , the prime minister noted that no refugee wants to go to Portugal , for example , adding that the majority of asylum seekers simply wanted to live in prosperous Germany ",0
"“ The reason why people are in your country is not because they are refugees , but because they want a German life , ” he said , describing the issue “ politically ” as a European problem but , “ sociologically , ” as a German problem ",1
Orban specifically targeted Germany and Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s ‘ open - door’ policy towards asylum seekers ,0
"“ I ’ve never understood how chaos , anarchy and illegal border crossings are viewed as something good in a country like Germany , which we view as the best example of discipline and the rule of law , ” he said ",1
"The recent wave of refugees reaching Europe is merely an invasion , according to Orban ",1
"“ If someone wants to come to your house , he knocks on your door and asks : ‘ Can we come in , can we stay?’ They [ asylum seekers ] did n’t do that , they crossed the border illegally , ” he stated ",0
"Orban then did what most political representatives will simply not do , he told the truth about multiculturalism ",0

PM Orban has remained consistent ,0
He has publicly told the Muslim invaders to leave Hungary and never come back ,1
"He has rebuffed Brussels , which is largely Islamic , and told them that Hungary would defend its borders , and it has ",1
Orban 's border wall reduced illegal immigration by 99 % ! ,0

"Furthermore , Orban has also called out the man behind the curtain in a lot of the promoting of this Muslim invasion of the West , George Soros ",1

"After former Democratic IT aide Imran Awan allegedly threatened his stepmother not to talk to police , her email account was accessed in suspicious ways and a lawyer for one of Awan ’s brothers found out she emailed the FBI on specific dates and lashed out at her : “ You ’re a liar , are n’t you ? ” Days after that , a bank account the stepmother controlled was almost completely drained through a payment to Imran ’s brother , Abid Awan , bank records show — but she said she is too afraid to press criminal charges because she claims he has threatened her ",1

"Imran , Abid and Jamal Awan — along with Imran ’s wife , Hina Alvi , and a friend — worked as IT administrators for 1 out of every 5 House Democrats and could read all their emails and files until police banned them from the network in February 2017for “ numerous violations of House security policies ",0
"” Months later , none of the family is in jail , and the stepmother and other witnesses have said Imran and Abid have used their freedom to try to steer the outcome of the case since , including by threatening them not to cooperate with authorities , TheDCNF previously reported ",0
"In April 2016 , the House ’s Chief Administrative Officer ( CAO ) detected allegedly falsified purchase orders , and the Inspector General quickly expanded the scope to investigate cyber violations , finding that members of the Awan family improperly accessed congressmen ’s servers and the House Democratic Caucus server thousands of times ",0
"Though House officials suspected that equipment was being stolen , the Capitol Police did not search their homes , The Daily Caller News Foundation learned , and did not ban them from the network until nearly a year later ",0
"In the meantime , evidence appears to have been compromised : In December 2016 , the CAO notified congressmen that the caucus server had physically disappeared ",0

"The Death Penalty , Instituted by God Himself ( The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment ) ",0
TO ARGUE AGAINST THE DEATH PENALTY is to contend with constituted reality ,1
"Ever since Adam and Eve committed the Original Sin , every living creature is subject to it ",0
Every one of us is born on Death Row and lives out his allotted lifespan in its shadow without hope of reprieve ,1
"God made that clear when He told Adam that “ in what day soever ” he preferred his own will above his Creator ’s , “ thou shalt die the death , ” condemning him sooner or later to “ return to the earth out of which thou wast taken : for dust thou art , and to dust thou shalt return ” ( Gen. 3:19 ) ",1
"In other words , there has always been a death penalty ",1
"God instituted it , and He was the first to impose it , embedding it in the very fabric of natural law ",1
"When Cain took it upon himself to inflict death on his brother Abel “ in the field , ” he soon learned that God furthermore reserved the exercise of this right to himself alone ",0
"Cain is told , “ What hast thou done ? ",0
"The voice of thy brother ’s blood crieth to me from the earth , ” and God curses him for his presumption by dooming him to homelessness and unproductive labor ",1
When Cain complains that being a “ vagabond ,1
"on the earth , every one therefore that findeth me , shall kill me , ” God laid down that “ whoever shall kill Cain shall be punished sevenfold , ” setting a mysterious identifying mark on him to protect him from the vengeance of others ",1
"The Fifth Commandment later delivered to Moses , “ Thou shalt not kill , ” therefore dates from adamic times , when it operated as God ’s exclusive prerogative , allowing no exceptions ",0
"Although men certainly continued to kill one another in a society which in fact became so wicked """""""" that all the thought of their heart was bent upon evil at all times , """""""" they did so as murderers , outside God 's law without legal right ",1
"Only after the Flood , when Noah and his sons set about repopulating the earth , did God delegate to human society His exclusive authority to impose the death penalty for just cause ",0
"He told Noah , “ For I will require the blood of your lives at the hand of every beast , and at the hand of man , at the hand of every man , and of his brother , will I require the life of man ",0
"Whosoever shall shed man ’s blood , his blood shall be shed : for man was made to the image of God ",0
"” In other words , from that point in history lawful killing in atonement for taking the life of another is sanctioned by God ",1
"After the great theophany on Sinai , Moses codified the death penalty as part of the old law of talion , which in strict justice required “ life for life , eye for eye , tooth for tooth , hand for hand , foot for foot ” ( Deut ",1

"The supreme penalty was imposed not only for murder , but for many other serious offenses : for adultery , rape , sodomy , kidnapping , for striking or cursing parents , for sacrificing a child to Moloch ",0
"Idolatry , fortune - telling , acting as a medium , preaching apostasy or attempting in any way to entice another from the faith were also punishable by death , as was blasphemy , an offense considered so heinous that the Law specified , “ He that blasphemeth the name of the Lord , dying let him die : all the multitude shall stone him , whether he be a native or a stranger ” ( Lev ",1

"Everyone was furthermore responsible for the atonement due to God for a crime whose evil consequences would otherwise have affected them all : “ The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to kill him , and afterwards the hands of the rest of the people ; that thou mayest take away the evil out of the midst of thee ” ( Deut ",0

"The Law read , “ Defile not the land of your habitation which is stained with the blood of the innocent : neither can it otherwise be expiated , but by his blood that hath shed the blood of another ” ( Num ",0

"In order to emphasize the fact that it is God , and not man , who is always the principal party to be avenged , provision was made for a heifer to be killed as propitiation in the case of an unsolved murder whose perpetrator could not be found ( Deut ",0
20:1 - 9 ) ,0
"After all , it is not the injury to relatives or any other human consideration that makes homicide the serious sin that it is , but as God Himself pointed out to Noah , it is the fact that “ man was made to the image of God ” that makes an assault on him tantamount to an assault on God ",1
"It is therefore to God , and not to His creatures that reparation is primarily due ",1
"This point was brought out by Pope Pius XII in an address to Italian Catholic jurists on May 12 , 1954 , when he said : ",0
A penalty is the reaction required by law and justice in response to a fault : penalty and fault are action and reaction ,0
Order violated by a culpable act demands the reintegration and re - establishment of the disturbed equilibrium ,0
A word must be said on the full meaning of penalty ,0
"Most of the modern theories of penal law explain penalty and justify it in the final analysis as a means of protection , that is , defense of the community against criminal undertakings , and at the same time an attempt to bring the offender to observance of the law ",0
"In those theories , the penalty can include sanctions such as the diminution of some goods guaranteed by law , so as to teach the guilty to live honestly , but those theories fail to consider the expiation of the crime committed , which penalizes the violation of the law as the prime function of penalty ",0
"In the metaphysical order , penalty is a consequence of dependence on the supreme will , dependence which exists in the deepest recesses of created being ",0
"If it is ever necessary to hold back the revolt of the free being and re - establish the violated law , it is when that is required by the supreme Judge and supreme Justice ",0
"Today the death penalty is imposed ever more rarely , even in cases of proven premeditated murder ",0
"Despite the fact that it was instituted by God Himself , growing numbers of Catholics actually consider it immoral ",1
"John Paul II , stopping just short of declaring it wrong in principle , has declared that it should be imposed very seldom , if ever ",0
But does n’t admitting the penalty in principle demand that it be put into practice ? ,0
"In the U.S. , following the lead of the late Cardinal Bernardin of Chicago and like minded prelates won to the new man - centered conciliar religion , the faithful are beginning to equate abortion , nuclear war and capital punishment as common “ threats to the sacredness of human life ” without any reference whatever to the innocence or guilt involved ",1
"If they are aware that the Church has upheld from Apostolic times the right to use force in self - defense , to kill in a just war and to inflict the death penalty on those duly judged guilty of serious crime , they now apparently subscribe to the notion propagated by Dei Verbum at the Second Vatican Council that the unchanging Catholic “ tradition which comes from the Apostles ” actually “ develops in the Church ” and keeps pace with changing times ( II,8 ) ",0
"The circumstances pertaining to our day would therefore dictate a reassessment of the death penalty , which the new man - centered theology insists on viewing almost exclusively from the standpoint of the criminal and human society rather than from God ’s ",1
"At the same time , there is more and more discussion about society ’s responsibility for having produced criminals in the first place , together with our moral obligation to rehabilitate them rather than to wreak what is now considered a form of fruitless , guilty “ vengeance ” on them ",1
The idea that man is by nature good and perfectible is allowed to override all documented evidence that hardened criminals are in fact almost impossible to rehabilitate and that those handed life sentences rarely repent of their wrongdoing ,0
"According to one widely held opinion , the death penalty has proved to be no effective deterrent to crime in any case , and should be discarded as impractical ",0
What proof of this can possibly be offered ? ,1
How can we know ? ,1
"Deterrence from evil is not the primary purpose of meting out punishment in any case , yet Scripture attests to deterrence as an important side effect of any penalty ",0
"To a man proven to have given false witness against another , Deuteronomy laid down , “ They shall render to him as he meant to do to his brother ",0
that others hearing may fear and may not dare to do such things ,0
"Thou shalt not pity him , but shalt require life for life , eye for eye , tooth for tooth , hand for hand , foot for foot ” ( Deut ",1
19:19 - 21 ) ,0
"And the Preacher notes that when “ sentence is not speedily pronounced against the evil , the children of men commit evils without any fear ” ( Eccles ",1
8:11 ) ,0
"To illustrate how shallow Catholic thinking on the death penalty has become and how far it has deviated from the age - old doctrine of the Church , a priest of a presumably traditional Catholic Fraternity writes in answer to a query addressed to him on the subject by saying : ",1
"The death penalty is based on the common teachings of theologians , but is not itself a declared dogma ",0
"Therefore it is not permissible to call those who hold it is , immoral heretics ",1
To approach this as a dogmatic teaching is imprudent ,1
Those who argue for its abolition do not necessarily put society in danger considering possibilities of penal systems ,0
"Those , however , who maintain its continued use often see it more as a tool for revenge ",1
"Please consider that in anger and tragedy , the desire for revenge usually overrides reason and an honest answering of the question “ must this person ’s life be taken to preserve society ? ” The desire for swift and firm convictions has sent many to death who never deserved such a punishment , nor was such a punishment truly necessary for the safety of society ",1
I do not believe the death penalty is necessary in 90 percent of the cases where it is applied ,0
Thus to call for a moratorium ,0
is not unjust or incorrect ,0
"That the death penalty can become an instrument of revenge , and that unjust sentences are sometimes handed down can be dismissed as irrelevant to the argument ",0
"Given the fallen human condition , such injustices are bound to occur in any judicial system , and everyone agrees that they should be ruthlessly remedied ",1
What is not irrelevant is that the author of the letter falls headlong into the very error Pius XII warns against ,1
"Considering the physical safety of society as the only real reason for executing a criminal , he feels the death penalty can now be safely discarded , allegedly on the grounds that we now have at our disposal many better ways of protecting people from him ",0
"That the penalty is due primarily as expiation to God in justice , and only secondarily to man has been lost sight of altogether ",0
"The supernatural dimension of the punishment as an agent for the spiritual good of both society and the criminal is furthermore not only not addressed , but treated as non - existent ",1
This first appeared in The Remnant nearly 20 years ago ,0
Is n't it time to subscribe to the ' paper of record ' for the traditional Catholic counterrevolution ? ,0
The source of this kind of materialistic thinking in the Church is not hard to trace ,0
"According to statistics published in the National Review for September 16 , 1983 , out of 9,140 murders committed in the U.S. in 1960 just before the Council , 56 persons were executed ",0
"In 1965 , the year the Council closed , although the tally of murders had risen to 9,850 , only 7 were executed ",0
In the decade from 1967 to 1977 a moratorium was declared during which not one single execution took place ,0
"At its close the number of murders had more than doubled , and in any six month period , more Americans were being murdered than those executed during the whole course of the century ",0
"At this point , although the murder rate has continued to rise dramatically , executions continue to be rare ",1
"Many nations , notably England , France , Sweden , South Africa and our neighbors Canada and Mexico , have abolished the death penalty altogether ",1
Whether or not the U. S. will follow suit and outlaw it nationally still remains to be seen ,0
What leaps to the eye from the mounting statistics is that decline in the exercise of the death penalty has kept close pace with decline in the Faith and church attendance ,1
"It is sober fact that death sentences were liberally handed out in the heyday of Christendom , when the Faith was strong and governments legislated with an eye to the spiritual welfare of citizens whose sights were primarily on future bliss in heaven ",1
"In modern times , which find the Church strictly separated from the state on principle and denied any active part in civil government , secularism has become the state religion , directing legislation exclusively to temporal objectives ",0
It is only to be expected that materialists — for whom the immortal soul does not exist and who believe that this present life of the senses on earth is the only one man has — should be reluctant to punish anyone by killing him ,0
"In their eyes this means total extinction , a penalty certainly in excess of any transgression of which he may be guilty ",1
"Not even God completely obliterates a human existence , not even for the most odious sins , for He made the human soul immortal and hell eternal ",1
"( It might be argued , however , that if the criminal is thought to have to have totally terminated his victim , why not do the same to him ? ) ",1
"In the days of Christendom , condemned criminals were given every opportunity to make their peace with God , in many cases the date of execution being delayed in order to accomplish this purpose ",0
"Justice was served , but not at the expense of charity , and there was no question of taking vengeance on the culprit ",0
Nor was the idea of “ rehabilitation ” with possible re - entry into society ever entertained where crimes deserving death were concerned ,0
"It has been noted by prison chaplains in our century that swift execution in most cases leads to admission of guilt and sincere repentance , whereas those who receive life sentences or suffer long delays are likely to maintain their innocence in hopes of a parole and eventually die in their sins ",0
"As it is , the death penalty as administered by society must be viewed against the backdrop of divine revelation if it is to make any real sense ",1
"When Catholic society puts a man to death , it terminates only his temporal life on earth , catapulting him into eternity for his final judgment before almighty God ",1
"Suffering the penalty not only allows the criminal to render expiation to God and to society , but if accepted in Christ ’s grace with due repentance , it preserves his soul from hell and eliminates much of his purgatory ",1
"If his contrition is perfect , it ’s conceivable that he could go straight to heaven ! ",0
"In any case , neither he nor society is any longer burdened with the guilt of his wrongdoing ",0
"As Michel Martin pointed out in an article in Rome et d’Ailleurs for September - October 1983 , “ The truth is that the problem of the death penalty is insoluble except from a Christian point of view ",1
"” That it figured so prominently in Christian societies is due to the fact that , in the order of charity , atonement to God was sought above any atonement due to man , and the spiritual welfare of citizens above their physical well - being ",1
"Modern secularized society assumes that physical extinction is the worst thing that can happen to a human being , whereas the faith teaches that eternal damnation is incalculably worse ",1
"In the context of the faith , the importance of a man ’s present short life on earth can not be compared with his future endless existence in heaven ",1
+ + + ,0
"As we have seen , the death penalty has a very long history ",0
"Dating from its institution by God in Eden to its delegation after the Flood to men who would wield it in God ’s name , it has threaded its way without interruption through the fabric of human civilizations until these latter days ",1
"One might expect that after the Incarnation , when God became man and replaced the Old Testament ’s law of talion based on strict justice with a new dispensation based on love and grace , the death penalty could be safely abolished as outmoded ",1
"Converts to the prevailing conciliar religion and its “ New Pentecost ” would in fact argue in this wise , perhaps citing the Council ’s famous declaration in Gaudium et Spes that , “ Thanks to the experience of past ages ... the nature of man himself is more clearly revealed and new roads to truth are opened , ” and the world now has “ a keener awareness of human dignity ” ( 44 , 73 ) ",1
"Far from obliterating the death penalty , however , the Incarnation only laid bare its deepest significance , hidden from the beginning ",1
"As the new dispensation ’s foremost theologian , St. Paul would declare , the old penalty remained very much in force : “ Almost all things , according to the law , are cleansed with blood : and without the shedding of blood there is no remission ",1
"” It is still “ appointed for men once to die , and after this the judgment ” ( Heb ",0
"9 : 22,27 ) , but now with the possibility of eternal bliss in heaven ",1
"This possibility is owed , furthermore , to a death by one of the cruelest means ever devised , unjustly inflicted on one supremely innocent Man who was God , in a miscarriage of human justice beyond any the world could ever have imagined ",1
"When God set the death penalty in Eden He pronounced it on Himself , to be carried out in the fullness of time through the malicious free wills of his own creatures ",0
"The Cross which was its instrument is the very sign of Christianity , the only means of salvation ",0
"Not even from the Cross did Christ decry the death penalty , either for himself or for the two thieves crucified with Him ",0
"It would continue to be dealt out to men by other men on earth , with only one significant change : Henceforth it would be administered under the authority of the glorified man who is Christ the King , as part and parcel of that universal power “ in heaven and on earth ” which He received from His Father ( Matt ",1
28:18 ) after His Resurrection ,0
"From that point on it is Christ who delegates the divine authority to punish by killing , and both Scripture and tradition testify that it is lawfully wielded by those to whom He entrusts the temporal sword in His Kingdom ",1
"As He told Pontius Pilate at the time of His trial , “ Thou shouldst not have any power against me , unless it were given thee from above ” ( John 19:10 ) ",0
"Pope Leo XIII re - affirmed this truth in Sapientiae Christianae in 1890 , when he declared that “ true and legitimate authority is devoid of sanction unless it proceed from God the supreme Ruler and Lord of all ",0
The Almighty alone can commit power to a man over his fellow men ,0
"” Even though they may be unaware of the true source of their power , it is always the duty of legitimate authorities to ensure public order by punishing evil - doers , by death if appropriate ",0
As St. Paul said : ,0
"Therefore he that resisteth the power , resisteth the ordinance of God , and they that resist purchase to themselves eternal damnation ",0
"For rulers are not a terror to the good work , but to the evil ",0

"Sufficient of itself to expiate every sin which the children of Adam could ever commit , the execution of the Man - God nevertheless did not abolish the penalty of death ",1
"It continues to be the wages of sin ( Rom 6:23 ) , and men must still submit to it sooner or later by forfeiting their lives , either willingly or unwillingly ",1
"A share in making restitution for sin was thus accorded to all of us , for although our Lord ’s ignominious death removed from us the guilt of the original transgression through Baptism , it did not remove its effects ",0
"These were allowed to remain as restraints on men who , now raised to a new supernatural existence , were capable of committing incalculably more grievous sins than heretofore ",1
"As for the death penalty , it remains the inescapable consequence of our fallen nature and is of the highest utility in deterring us from following our hereditary inclination to evil ",1
"What Christ did was to sanctify the death penalty , transforming it into a sacrament of life for those who believe ",0
"As St. Paul declared , “ Death is swallowed up in victory ",0
"O death , where is thy victory ? ",0

Criminals put to death undergo a penalty no different from the one exacted from the most innocent amongst us ,0

"This could be a great mercy for them as well as for society , both in terms of expiation and protection from any future crimes they might have perpetrated ",0
"The death penalty , from the first one imposed on man by God in the beginning in Eden , to the one imposed on God by man on that Good Friday in Jerusalem , on down to those still being imposed today , transcends human legislation ",1

Ramadan Jihad 2018 Death Toll So Far Is 218 ,1
"Another Ramadan is upon us , and the jihad death toll so far stands at 218 Infidels , murdered in 53 jihad attacks ",1
Once again this year we see that Ramadan is quintessentially the month of jihad ,1
A jihad group explained it back in 2012 : “ The month of Ramadan is a month of holy war and death for Allah ,1
"It is a month for fighting the enemies of Allah and God ’s messenger , the Jews and their American facilitators ",1
"” Referring to a jihad attack that happened at that time , the message continued : “ One of our groups aided by Allah managed to bomb a bus full of Jewish tourists , plunderers of holy lands , after careful tracking ",1
The holy war is not confined to a particular arena and we shall fight the Jews and the Americans until they leave the land of Islam ,1
” ,0
"In contrast , President Trump issued a statement claiming that “ Ramadan reminds us of the richness Muslims add to the religious tapestry of American life ",1

So which is it ? ,0
"Does Ramadan remind us of “ the richness Muslims add to the religious tapestry of American life , ” or is Ramadan “ a month of calamity everywhere for nonbelievers ” ? ",1
Islam ’s core beliefs make it clear that the latter statement is closer to the truth ,1
"During Ramadan , Muslims are exhorted to renew and deepen their devotion to Allah ",0
Hence it is a time when they ’re supposed to grow more generous and kind toward their fellow Muslims ,0
"However , the Qur’an says : “ Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah , and those who are with him are severe against disbelievers , and merciful among themselves ” ( 48:29 ) ",1
"If the Ramadan imperative is to become more devout , the Muslim who applies himself diligently to the Ramadan observance will simultaneously become more both merciful to his fellow Muslims and more severe against the unbelievers ",1
Murdering infidels thus does n’t contradict the spirit of Ramadan ; it embodies it ,1
"The Kavkaz Center , a website operated by Chechen jihadists , explained in a 2010 article that the idea of Ramadan as a time for warfare against infidels went back to Muhammad ’s time : “ The month of Ramadan in the life of the Prophet ( pbuh ) and the righteous ancestors was a month of forthcoming ",1
"The greatest battles during the lifetime of the Prophet ( pbuh ) occurred in this blessed month , the month of jihad , zeal and enthusiasm ",1
” ,0
"Trump was , unfortunately , following the example of his two immediate predecessors when he claimed that “ Ramadan reminds us of the richness Muslims add to the religious tapestry of American life , ” and was severely misleading the American people ",1
"Ironically , even in doing this he is likely to fail to satisfy Muslims , or anyone ",0
"After all , after the Trump White House issued a similar statement last year , the Washington Post ran a lengthy piece in which several Muslims explained why the statement was unsatisfactory to them ",0
"Shadi Hamid of the Qatar - funded Brookings Institution declared : “ Trump has so rarely recognized that American Muslims even exist , but this offers apparent proof that he is aware of our existence ",1
Great ! ,1
"Putting all that context aside , it ’s offensive and pretty much terrible ",1
” ,0
Why ? ,0
Because Trump had the temerity to mention jihad terrorism ,0
"Hamid continued : “ We , as American Muslims , should n’t be defined solely in our relationship to bad things that we have nothing to do with ",0
We ’re also normal people who happen to be Muslim and to see us and our history in America so narrowly is plain out offensive ,1
” ,0
What is actually offensive is that Hamid would try in this way to absolve the Muslim community of any responsibility to root out jihad terrorist from its midst ,1
"There is certain to be more jihad terrorism during this Ramadan , and some of it may be committed by Muslims in the U.S. Hamid , if he cared about this , would be confronting honestly the teachings of Islam that make Ramadan the month of jihad , and working to reform them ",1
"Meanwhile , it would be dangerous , suicidal folly for Infidels to pretend that Ramadan is not the month of jihad ",1
"And as our Ramadan willful blindness continues , more Infidels will die ",1

| Articles ,0
) ,0
"Forget the Wolff book brouhaha and Trump ’s latest DACA dalliance —the real story is outside the Beltway , where real people live and work ",1
December marked the fifth month in a row in which the immigrant working - age population ( legal and illegal declined from the same month of the prior year ,0
"Simultaneously , immigrant displacement of American workers fell , also apparently confirming a trend that began in September ",0
"And , by the way , black unemployment is at a record low ",0
What started after the 2016 election as a reduction in the rate of increase in the foreign - born population of working age has turned into an outright retreat ,1
"This is in dramatic contrast to the last months of the Obama Regime , which saw year - over - year increases in immigrant working - age population far in excess of the estimated 1 million legal immigrants admitted annually , and which I argued meant that an unreported illegal alien surge was underway ",1
"According to the Labor Department employment report released last Friday , December there were 77,000 fewer working - age immigrants ( legal and illegal ) in the country in December 2017 than in December 2016—a decline of 0.18 % ",0
"This follows year - over - year drops of 138,000 in August , 143,000 in September , and 117,000 in October , and 64,000 in November ",0
"Not since the Great Recession has the foreign - born working - age population declined for five consecutive months — but now , in telling contrast , the economy is expanding ",0
This makes the Trump Era immigrant workforce decline especially striking ,1
Note that this is a net figure ,0
The year - over- year reduction in the immigrant working - age population does not mean new immigrants have stopped coming in ,0
"About 300,000 immigrants die annually , and an equal number leave ( voluntarily or otherwise ) , according to a study by the Center for Immigration Studies ",0
[ U.S. ,0
"Immigrant Population Hit Record 43.7 Million in 2016 , By Steven A. Camarota and Karen Zeigler , October 16 , 2017 ] So the 77,000 reduction in working - age immigrants from December 2016 to December 2017 is consistent with a gross inflow of about 500,000 new foreign - born workers ( legal and illegal ) over that period — the gross inflow more than offset by the gross reduction of 600,000 due to deaths , deportations , and immigrant emigrants ",0
This helps explain why a reduction in the immigrant workforce population reduction is compatible with reports of a recent increase in illegal immigration on the U.S. southwest border ( albeit still less than at the end of the Obama Regime ) ,0
"The additional good news : Native - born American workers took all the jobs created this month , according to the Household Survey , which records workers’ immigrant status ( but not their legal status ) ",0
"The Household Survey reported 103,000 jobs were created last month — well below the 148,000 figure found by the far more widely - cited Payroll Survey ",0
In December 2017 : ,0
"Immigrant employment fell by 246,000 , down by 0.93 % ",0
"Native - born American employment rose a whopping 349,000 – up 0.27 % ",0

"The New VDARE American Worker Displacement Index ( NVDAWDI ) , our term for the ratio of immigrant to native - born employment growth indexes , fell fromto(100X ( 120.9/106.0 ) ) ",0
Trump may not have delivered ( yet ) on his promise to bring back the factory and coal jobs so many of his supporters lost during the Obama years ,0
"But by shrinking the pool of immigrants willing to do that work , he has put more money in pockets of his voters ",0
While overall wage growth remains modest – 2.5 % per annum in December – Blue collar workers have beat this by a wide margin : ,0
“ It is commonly said that wage stagnation contributed to an economic anxiety in middle America that carried Donald Trump into the White House … Yet Mr. Trump ’s rise seems to have coincided with a turnaround in fortunes for the middle class ,1
… The latest development — one that will be of particular interest to Mr. Trump — is that blue - collar wages have begun to rocket ,1
"… In the year [ 2017 ] to the third quarter , wage and salary growth for the likes of factory workers , builders and drivers easily outstripped that for professionals and managers ",0
"In some cases , blue - collar pay growth now exceeds 4 % … ” Blue - collar wages are surging ",0
"Can it last ? , The Economist , Magazine , November 14th 2017 ",0
Eleven months of Trump has not come close to undoing the damage done by eight years of Obama ,0
Native - born American workers lost ground to their foreign - born competitors throughout the Obama years and this trend accelerated significantly in the months leading up to the election : ,0
"Ca n't render , error ",0
"Native - born American employment growth is represented by the black line , immigrant employment growth is in pink , and NVAWDI — the ratio of immigrant to native - born American job growth — is in blue ",0

"It fell sharply in the months after the 2016 election , but roared back to Obama - era levels in the spring ",1
"Immigrants held 16.99 % of total jobs in December , a significant drop from November ’s 17.16 % share ",0

La Stampa ’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara ,0
La Stampa ’s Robert Fastiggi Replied to Chris Ferrara ’s articles on Fastiggi and Goldstein ’s defense of Amoris Laetitia and their criticism of the Filial Correction : ,0
"Fastiggi ’s exchange with Ferrara concerning “ Wait , Wait , It ’s all a mistranslation ! ” ",0
Robert Fastiggi • 13 hours ago ,0
"In the article that I co - authored with Dr. Goldstein , we would have done better to speak of the “ official ” Latin text rather than the “ original ” Latin text ",0
"This , though , is no longer an issue because the normative text is the Latin text published in thr AAS ",0
"Mr. Ferrara , however , bases his critique upon an assumption that the “ generous response ” offered to God is a sin ",1
"This , though , is not what AL is saying ",1
The generous response is a move away from sin and a move toward God ,0
I explain this in my most recent response to Prof ,0
"E. Christian Brugger , which can serve as my response to Mr. Ferrara : ",0
Posted on LifeSiteNews : ,0
Prof ,0
"Brugger is a good theologian and a fine man , but he still seems to believe that AL 303 implies that God is asking people to continue to sin in some cases ",0
"In his April 22 , 2016 article in Catholic World Report , Brugger writes that AL 303 suggests that “ God can be ‘ asking’ someone to live in a life - state in which they are objectively violating grave matter ",0
"” Then in a Sept. 28 ‘ 17 LifeSiteNews article , he states that “ the generous response ” owed to God is “ a certain state that is objectively at variance with the universal command of the Gospel ",0
” Now Prof ,0
"Brugger argues that , because the subject remains “ this conscience ” in AL 303 , this proves that the “ generous offering owed to God ” is the recognition that one is living “ contrary to “ the universal command of the Gospel ",0
” ,0
Prof ,0
Brugger fails to see that AL 303 clearly distinguishes between a conscience ’s recognition that “ a given situation is objectively at variance with the general mandate of the Gospel ” and this same conscience ’s subsequent recognition of a “ generous response owed to God in the present circumstances ,0
” The subject “ conscience ” might be the same but the object is different ,0
The “ generous response ” is not the situation that is at variance with the command of the Gospel but an offering that God is asking amid the mass of impediments even though it may not yet be the perfect objective model ,0
What might be this “ generous response ? ” Pope Francis does not give an example in AL 303 because he ’s speaking in general terms of the dynamics of conscience ,0
"Moreover , he knows that concrete cases vary widely ",0
"In our Sept. 26 article in La Stampa , Dr. Goldstein and I provided a hypothetical example of a couple in a purely civil “ marriage ” recognizing that God is calling them to live in continence ",0
We chose this example deliberately to demonstrate that “ the generous response ” could be the ending of a particular sin ,0
Our example was an attempt to show that Professors Brugger and Seifert are wrong to believe AL 303 implies that God is asking some people to continue to live in an objectively sinful state ,0
It ’s really just the opposite ,0
AL 303 teaches that conscience will come to recognize that God is asking for a step in the right direction away from sin ,0
"Pope Francis explains this again in AL 305 when he says “ a small step , in the midst of great human limitations , can be more pleasing to God than a life which appears outwardly in order , but moves through the day without confronting great difficulties.’ ” ",1
"In a recent interview ( http://www.lastampa.it/2017 ... , the Italian philosopher , Rocco Buttiglione , provides this example for AL 303 : “ Imagine a father who has a sick son and the child improves ",0
He still has fever but has stopped vomiting ; the child manages to keep in his stomach what he eats and has started a therapy that seems to work ,0
The father is happy ,0
Is he happy about the fact that the child is sick ? ,0
"No , he is pleased that his son gives symptoms of improvement and healing ",0
” ,0
This is what Pope Francis is saying in AL 303 ,0
God is not happy with situations that are objectively at variance with the command of the Gospel ,0
"God , however , is happy when people in such situations discern in conscience that He is asking them to make a choice that moves in the right direction — even if they still need to progress further toward a more complete fulfillment of His will ",0
This is the law of gradualness not the gradualness of the law ,0
It is sad that this beautiful and compassionate message of AL 303 has been so completely misunderstood by scholars who have failed to grasp its true meaning ,0
Chris Ferrara to Robert Fastiggi • 9 hours ago ,0
I certainly agree that the Latin text is the normative text even if it comes later ,0
I certainly do not agree that the Latin text eliminates the grave problems with Amoris Laetitia ,0
"Rather , as I show in my article , it only intensifies them ",0
"With all due respect to Dr. Fastiggi , his argument and that of Buttiglione , that a “ move away from sin ” is what is pleasing to God , even if the moral norm is not adhered to , is sophistical ",1
What constitutes a “ move away ” from sin if not ceasing to commit the sin ? ,0
No example is provided in AL because none can be ,0
The notion is nonsensical ,0
Just how nonsensical is demonstrated by Dr. Fastiggi ’s claim that by “ a move away from sin ” in the case of a divorced and “ remarried ” couple Francis means their agreement to live in continence as brother and sister for the sake of children ,0
But that would be ceasing to commit the sin of adultery altogether as it would involve abandoning the pretense that they are married along with the illicit sexual relation itself ,0
"Such a couple could always be absolved and receive Holy Communion under the Church ’s constant practice , albeit privately to avoid scandal ",0
"At any rate , the “ brother and sister ” approach to the situation , which is that of Familiaris consortio 84 , is certainly not the one advocated by Francis ",0
"As my article shows , Francis has made it quite clear that he approves of admitting to the sacraments divorced and “ remarried ” people who will continue to live as if they were married , including sexual relations , while “ discerning ” their situation , this “ discernment ” being a mere fig leaf to conceal the proposed toleration of public adultery in the Church ",0
"Thus , Francis thanked the Maltese bishops for their AL guidelines , which literally mandate admission to the sacraments of divorced and “ remarried ” people who believe themselves to be “ at peace with God ",0
"” And , as he told the bishops of Buenos Aires in writing , “ there is no other interpretation ",0
” ,0
"No amount of verbal artifice can conceal what is happening in the Church thanks to AL : Public adulterers are being admitted to Holy Communion without an amendment of life and the bimillenial discipline of the Church --- which John Paul insisted involves a moral norm , not a mere ecclesiastical law , to which everyone is bound in conscience “ without exception”---is being overthrown in place after place ",0
It is a great disservice to the Church to maintain the pretense that there is nothing problematical about AL ,0
A moral catastrophe is self - evidently underway and it is not possible honestly to deny its cause ,1
Robert Fastiggi to Chris Ferrara • 2 hours ago ,0
Thank you for your response ,0
You write well but you do not reveal a proper understanding of what Pope Francis is saying in AL 303 ,0
I can only ask that you to study the matter more carefully with an open heart and mind ,1
Chris Ferrara to Robert Fastiggi • 16 minutes ago ,0
"Tell that to the four cardinals , the 800,000 faithful , the 45 theologians and the 61 other original signers of the correctio , all of whom you insult with your superficial and I must say entirely sophistical attempt to explain away what Francis is clearly doing ",0
"Irony of ironies , the latter - day Pharisees and legalists Francis sees around every corner are hard at work defending Amoris Laetitia at the very moment it is being cited by bishop after bishop as their sole authority for admitting public adulterers to Holy Communion --- while Francis does nothing but approve ",1
"I think you should follow your own advice about studying this matter with an open heart and mind , but above all with open eyes , for you have clearly shut them to what is going in the dioceses in the name of AL ",1
Fastiggi ’s exchange with Ferrara concerning “ More Fake News : La Stampa Tries Again ,0
” ,0
Robert Fastiggi • 12 hours ago ,0
I would like to thank Christopher Ferrara again for calling attention to an article I co - authored with Dr. Goldstein in La Stampa ,0
I give him credit for his colorful style ,0
"Unfortunately , Mr. Ferrara provides no real evidence for his claim that Pope Francis “ wishes the bishops to admit public adulterers in ' second marriages ' to the sacraments while continuing their adulterous relations ",0
” ,0
"He mentions the Holy Father 's letter to the Buenos Aires bishops , but he fails to take into account that the statement of those Argentine bishops can be interpreted in an orthodox way , as Cardinal Müller told Edward Pentin in a Sept. 28 interview published in the National Catholic Register ",1
In fact the statement of the Argentine bishops only speaks of the possibility of “ access to the sacraments of Reconciliation and the Eucharist ,0
” This could reasonably be interpreted as going to confession before receiving Holy Communion ,0
The same applies to statements of Pope Francis and Cardinal Schoenborn mentioned by Ferrara ,0
Pope Francis defers to the exposition of Amoris laetitia by Cardinal Schoenborn given in April 2016 when the exhortation was made public ,0
"I have read the Cardinal 's exposition in both Italian and English , and I only find mention of the help of the sacraments in certain cases ",1
"Once again , Mr. Ferrara assumes this means access to Holy Communion without prior sacramental confession ",0
"With regard to the letter thanking the Bishops of Malta , it should be noted that Edward Pentin mentions a letter of Cardinal Baldiserri not a letter of Pope Francis ",0
"Moreover , this letter has not been made public so we do n't know exactly what it says other than an expression of thanks ",0
This seems to be very thin evidence for claiming Pope Francis wishes the bishops to admit public adulterers to the sacraments while continuing in their adulterous relations ,0
"As a lawyer , Ferrara should have a better sense of what really counts as evidence ",0
"As a Christian , he should also be mindful of the command against bearing false witness ",0
"Beyond these considerations , I wish to express a personal concern I have about Mr. Ferrara 's standing in the Catholic Church ",0
He says that Dr. Goldstein and I are “ foot soldiers of a Leviathan Church ” because we defend the Roman Pontiff ,1
Does Mr. Ferrara believe that the Catholic Church under Pope Francis is a “ Leviathan Church ” and not the Catholic Church ? ,1
"If this is so , then it would suggest that Mr. Ferrara is refusing submission to the Roman Pontiff and communion with the members of the Church subject to him ",1
"This , though , is the very definition of schism found in the Catechism of the Catholic Church , 2089 and the 1983 CIC canon 751 ",0
I hope Mr. Ferrara can clarify what he means by the “ Leviathan Church ” under Pope Francis ,0
A more simple question to him would be this : “ Are you refusing submission to the Roman Pontiff or communion with the members subject to him ? ” ,0
I apologize ahead of time if I misconstrued his words ,0
"I believe , though , my question is reasonable in light of his reference to a “ Leviathan Church ” distinct from “ the dictates of the Immortal God in heaven ",0
” ,0
Chris Ferrara to Robert Fastiggi • 9 hours ago ,0
"If Dr. Fastiggi wishes to continue to pretend , despite a growing mountain of evidence , that Pope Francis has not in fact approved of the admission of public adulterers to Holy Communion -- just as he did when Archbishop of Buenos Aires , and just as he did with the woman he telephoned in Argentina — then I can not help him ",0
"As for my metaphorical reference to a “ Leviathan Church , ” I am afraid Dr. Fastiggi has succumbed to an unfortunate literal - mindedness ",1
"To make it clear for him , I am contending that he and his co - author treat the Pope as if he were the absolute ruler of Hobbes ’s Leviathan ",0
"I do not , as should be obvious , argue that this Leviathan Church actually exists ",0
That it does not and can not exist is precisely my point ,0
"Dr. Fastiggi ’s inapt citation to Canon 751 and his clumsy and insulting questions about my “ standing in the Catholic Church ” and whether I am “ refusing submission to the Roman Pontiff ” demonstrate a pronounced lack of comprehension of pertinent ecclesiological and theological basics , and a rather embarrassing lack of rhetorical finesse ",1
"Raising objections to a papal document because it appears to depart from sound orthodoxy is hardly “ refusing submission to the Roman Pontiff , ” who has not , at any rate , actually commanded anyone to “ submit ” to anything via AL ",0
I respectfully suggest that Dr. Fastiggi ’s comments evince a need for serious study and reflection before he ventures further opinions on this controversy in public ,1

"IN MAY 2013 , the Washington Post ’s Greg Miller reported that the head of the CIA ’s clandestine service was being shifted out of that position as a result of “ a management shake - up ” by then - Director John Brennan ",0
"As Miller documented , this official — whom the paper did not name because she was a covert agent at the time — was centrally involved in the worst abuses of the CIA ’s Bush - era torture regime ",0
"As Miller put it , she was “ directly involved in its controversial interrogation program ” and had an “ extensive role ” in torturing detainees ",0

﻿Vatican Theologian Sacked for Questioning “ Merciful ” Pope ’s Pontificate ,0
By now the whole Catholic world has heard of the publication of a devastating letter to Pope Francis from Father Thomas G. Weinandy ,1
"The former head of the theological secretariat of the U.S. Bishop ’s conference , Fr ",0
Weinandy has taught at both Oxford and the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome ,0
None other than Francis appointed Fr ,0
"Weinandy to the International Theological Commission and awarded him the Pro Pontifice et Ecclesiae medal , the ecclesial equivalent of the Congressional Medal of Honor , for his work on behalf of the Pope and the Church ",0
"One of the world ’s most renowned theologians , Fr ",0
Weinandy is a “ man of the Council ” and a prominent figure of the post - conciliar mainstream ,0
Yet Fr ,0
"Weinandy ’s letter , sent to Francis privately last summer but predictably ignored by him — along with every other private entreaty concerning his destructive activity — is a withering indictment of a papacy that constitutes nothing less than a menace to the Church ",1
"The key passages ( paragraph breaks added ) rebuke Francis for his recklessness , his deliberate ambiguity , his fomenting of error , his sowing of disunity , his unheard - of calumnies of the faithful , and even his reduction of the faith to an ideology — precisely the wrong of which he accuses orthodox Catholics : ",0
"Your Holiness , a chronic confusion seems to mark your pontificate … ",1
This fosters within the faithful a growing unease … ,0
"In """""""" Amoris Laetitia , """""""" your guidance at times seems intentionally ambiguous , thus inviting both a traditional interpretation of Catholic teaching on marriage and divorce as well as one that might imply a change in that teaching … ",0
"To teach with such a seemingly intentional lack of clarity inevitably risks sinning against the Holy Spirit , the Spirit of truth ",1
"The Holy Spirit is given to the Church , and particularly to yourself , to dispel error , not to foster it ",0
"[ Y]ou seem to censor and even mock those who interpret Chapter 8 of """""""" Amoris Laetitia """""""" in accord with Church tradition as Pharisaic stone - throwers who embody a merciless rigorism ",1
This kind of calumny is alien to the nature of the Petrine ministry … ,0
"Such behavior gives the impression that your views cannotsurvive theological scrutiny , and so must be sustained by “ ad hominem ” arguments ",0
[ T]oo often your manner seems to demean the importance of Church doctrine ,0
"Again and again you portray doctrine as dead and bookish , and far from the pastoral concerns of everyday life ",0
"Your critics have been accused , in your own words , of making doctrine an ideology ",0
"But it is precisely Christian doctrine … that frees people from worldly ideologies and assures that they are actually preaching and teaching the authentic , life - giving Gospel ",0
"Those who devalue the doctrines of the Church [ i.e. , Francis ! ] ",0
"separate themselves from Jesus , the author of truth … What they [ i.e. , Francis ] then possess , and can only possess , is an ideology – one that conforms to the world of sin and death ",0
"[ F]aithful Catholics can only be disconcerted by your choice of some bishops , men who seem not merely open to those who hold views counter to Christian belief but who support and even defend them ",0
"What scandalizes believers , and even some fellow bishops , is not only your having appointed such men to be shepherds of the Church , but that you also seem silent in the face of their teaching and pastoral practice … ",0
"As a result , many of the faithful , who embody the """""""" sensus fidelium , """""""" are losing confidence in their supreme shepherd ",0
"[ T]he Church is one body , the Mystical Body of Christ , and you are commissioned by the Lord himself to promote and strengthen her unity ",0
But your actions and words too often seem intent on doing the opposite … ,0
You have often spoken about the need for transparency within the Church ,0
"You have frequently encouraged … all persons , especially bishops , to speak their mind and not be fearful of what the pope may think ",0
"But … what many [ bishops ] have learned from your pontificate is not that you are open to criticism , but that you resent it … Many fear that if they speak their mind , they will be marginalized or worse ",0
"I have often asked myself : """""""" Why has Jesus let all of this happen ? """""""" ",0
"The only answer that comes to mind is that Jesus wants to manifest just how weak is the faith of many within the Church , even among too many of her bishops ",1
"Ironically , your pontificate has given those who hold harmful theological and pastoral views the license and confidence to come into the light and expose their previously hidden darkness … ",1
Father Weinandy reveals that he decided to publicize this historic missive only after receiving an unmistakable sign from heaven ,0
"As he recounts here , after repeatedly “ beseeching Jesus and Mary , St. Peter and all of the saintly popes who are buried there to do something to rectify the confusion and turmoil within the Church today , a chaos and an uncertainty that I felt Pope Francis had himself caused , ” he asked for a minutely specific sign from heaven on whether he should write the letter : that the next day he would meet someone he had not seen in a very long time , would never expect to see in Rome , and was not from the United States , Canada or Great Britain , which person would utter the particular phrase : “ Keep up the good writing ",0
” ,0
"At lunch the next day , the sign was given ",0
"An old friend he had not seen in more than twenty years and would never have expected to meet in Rome , who is now an archbishop , appeared suddenly from between two parked cars , renewed acquaintances and , referring to one of Father Weinandy ’s books , said : “ Keep up the good writing ",0
” ,0
Writes Fr ,0
Weinandy : “ I could hardly believe that this just happened in a matter of a few minutes ,0
But there was no longer any doubt in my mind that Jesus wanted me to write something ,0
I also think it significant that it was an Archbishop that Jesus used ,0
I considered it an apostolic mandate ,0
” ,0
Can we doubt that it was indeed an apostolic mandate ? ,0
Can we not see in Fr ,0
"Weinandy a voice raised up by heaven itself to say , from deep within the post - conciliar ecclesial establishment , things that exceed in their candor what even certain traditionalist commentators have ventured to state ? ",1

"I realize that in the heat of a shooting , particularly a mass shooting , it may take some time for a precise timeline to develop ",0

"Las Vegas police said Friday that the gunman who opened fire on a country music festival far below his hotel suite did not shoot a security guard six minutes before that rampage , contradicting a timeline they had offered earlier this week … ",1
"The confusion began Monday when police said that the gunman fired at the hotel security guard , Jesus Campos , six minutes before the mass shooting began , not during the massacre as they had said ",0
"Lombardo also said police had hunted for the source of the gunfire and that officers responding to the gunman ’s floor were unaware that a guard was shot until they arrived there , at which point the shooting rampage had ended ",0
"MGM Resorts pushed back on this account , first saying Tuesday that there were unspecified inaccuracies and then , on Thursday , releasing a statement directly contradicting parts of what the police had said … ",0
"Lombardo had said Monday that Campos , the guard , was shot at 9:59 p.m. and that the mass shooting began at 10:05 p.m. ",0
This six - minute gap relayed by Lombardo left uncertain whether there was any lag in alerting police to the source of the gunfire during critical moments ,0
"Police said officers arrived on the 32nd floor at 10:17 p.m. , two minutes after Paddock had stopped firing ",0
"MGM , though , said it was “ confident ” that the 9:59 p.m. time was inaccurate and “ was derived from a Mandalay Bay report manually created after the fact without the benefit of information we now have ",0
"” The company also disputed the suggestion of a lag , saying the shooting rampage began within a minute of Campos reporting his injury on the 32nd floor ",0
"On Friday , Lombardo effectively agreed with the company ’s statement , though he argued that the 9:59 p.m. time he had offered four days earlier “ was n’t inaccurate when I provided it ",0
” Lombardo said he was told this time had been written by someone in a security log ,0
"Upon investigation , Lombardo said , police learned that Campos first encountered a barricaded door on the 32nd floor at 9:59 p.m. ",0
"The guard was eventually fired upon by Paddock “ in close proximity to ” 10:05 p.m. , when the mass shooting began , Lombardo continued ",0
"Clear , right ? ",0
"Not so fast , the police and hotel still have disagreement over important details , such as when police arrived relative to Paddock ’s shooting at the crowd : An enormous , important discrepancy has emerged over what happened during the Las Vegas massacre : When did police arrive on the 32nd floor where Stephen Paddock was firing his deadly fusillade onto concertgoers below ?

Las Vegas police say they did n’t get to the floor until after the shooting was over ,0
"But MGM Resorts International , the owner of Mandalay Bay , says police officers were there shortly after the shooting began , responding to a report of a security guard being shot ",0
The discrepancy could raise questions about whether police might have taken steps to intervene while Paddock was launching his devastating 10-minute onslaught … ,0
"… on Thursday , in response to inquiries about when Mandalay Bay notified police of the Campos shooting , MGM Resorts issued a statement that was unequivocal : Las Vegas police officers accompanied Mandalay Bay security to the Campos shooting and “ immediately responded ",0
” MGM said that “ Metro officers were together with armed Mandalay Bay security officers in the building when Campos first reported that shots were fired over the radio ,0
These Metro officers and armed Mandalay Bay security officers immediately responded to the 32nd floor ,0
"” The statement says MGM believes Paddock began firing out the window of his room within 40 seconds of Campos reporting his shooting , and Lombardo said Friday , “ I agree with the statement ",0

The spread of cultural Marxism has contributed to the dumbing down of public education ,1
Too many government schools are more concerned with promoting political correctness than ensuring that students receive a good education ,0
"Even if cultural Marxism did not dumb down education , concerns that government schools are indoctrinating children with beliefs that conflict with parents’ political , social , and even religious beliefs would motivate many families to homeschool ",1
"Even when government schools are not intentionally promoting cultural Marxism or other left - wing ideologies , they are still implicitly biased toward big government ",0

"However , the materials are drafted in such a way that any Christian , Jewish , Muslim , or atheist parent can feel comfortable using the curriculum ",0
Interactive forums allow students to engage with and learn from each other ,0

"Concern about the safety of students in government - run schools is one reason many parents are considering homeschooling , but it is not the only reason ",1
Many parents are motivated by a desire to give their children something better than a curriculum that has been dumbed down by federal initiatives like Common Core ,0

"Archbishop Viganò Speaks , the Neo - Catholics Panic ",1
"In his eleven - page account , affirmed under oath , the Archbishop , marking a turning point in Church history , declares that senior Vatican officials , including former Secretaries of State Angelo Sodano and Tarcisio Bertone as well as Cardinal Óscar Andrés Rodríguez Maradiaga , coordinator of Pope Bergoglio ’s “ Council of Cardinals ” , covered up McCarrick ’s decades of sexual predation and that Bergoglio himself continued the coverup ",0
"This article was first written to address the neo - Catholic commentator Massimo Faggioli ’s attempt , following the Pennsylvania grand jury report and the fall of ex - Cardinal Theodore McCarrick , to minimize the homosexual crisis in the Church and blunt the correlative rise of what he derides as “ neo - traditionalism ",0
"” As my piece was about to go to press , however , EWTN ’s National Catholic Register broke the explosive story on the written testimony of Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò , former apostolic nuncio to the United States ( 2011 to 2016 ) ",1

"Evidently already aware of these facts , however , Bergoglio not only rehabilitated McCarrick but made him a “ trusted counselor ” who advised the elevation of the pro - homosexual prelates Blase Cupich , Joseph Tobin and Kevin Farrell to the College of Cardinals and the prominent episcopal sees they now discredit ",0
"All of this happened before Bergoglio , bowing to worldwide public pressure , finally — only weeks ago — took decisive action against his “ trusted counselor ",1
"” McCarrick had lobbied for Bergoglio ’s election , along with Maradiaga and the infamous Cardinal Danneels , who covered up homosexual rape committed by a priest against his own nephew , has supported “ same - sex marriage , ” and advised the King of Belgium to sign a law legalizing abortion in 1990 ",1
As Edward Pentin notes : “ all 3 prelates have since been special advisors of Francis or rehabilitated by him ,1
” ,0
"Viganò concludes his testimony by declaring that all of the prelates involved ( many others are implicated ) , including Bergoglio , should resign their offices for the good of the Church ",0
"As to Bergoglio in particular , he courageously states openly the truth that so many of his brethren know but fear to speak in public : ",0
"I want to recall this indefectible truth of the Church ’s holiness to the many people who have been so deeply scandalized by the abominable and sacrilegious behavior of the former Archbishop of Washington , Theodore McCarrick ; by the grave , disconcerting and sinful conduct of Pope Francis and by the conspiracy of silence of so many pastors , and who are tempted to abandon the Church , disfigured by so many ignominies ",1
"At the Angelus on Sunday , August 12 , 2018 Pope Francis said these words : “ Everyone is guilty for the good he could have done and did not do ... ",1
"If we do not oppose evil , we tacitly feed it ",1
We need to intervene where evil is spreading ; for evil spreads where daring Christians who oppose evil with good are lacking ,0
"” [ emphasis in original ] If this is rightly to be considered a serious moral responsibility for every believer , how much graver is it for the Church ’s supreme pastor , who in the case of McCarrick not only did not oppose evil but associated himself in doing evil with someone he knew to be deeply corrupt ",1
"He followed the advice of someone he knew well to be a pervert , thus multiplying exponentially with his supreme authority the evil done by McCarrick ",1
And how many other evil pastors is Francis still continuing to prop up in their active destruction of the Church ! ,1
[ my emphasis ] Francis is abdicating the mandate which Christ gave to Peter to confirm the brethren ,0
"Indeed , by his action he has divided them , led them into error , and encouraged the wolves to continue to tear apart the sheep of Christ ’s flock ",1
"In this extremely dramatic moment for the universal Church , he must acknowledge his mistakes and , in keeping with the proclaimed principle of zero tolerance , Pope Francis must be the first to set a good example for cardinals and bishops who covered up McCarrick ’s abuses and resign along with all of them ",1
[ emphasis in original ] ,0
"Before he was papal nuncio in Washington , Viganò headed the Governorate of Vatican City State after having served as Nuncio in Nigeria , a Delegate for the Pontifical Representatives of the Secretary of State of the Holy See and a Member of the Disciplinary Commission of the Roman Curia ",0
In those capacities he had access to documents and witnesses that corroborate his own firsthand testimony ,0
"With Viganò ’s testimony , the widespread homosexual infiltration of the post - Vatican II hierarchy , from the top on down , now emerges mountainously into view , never to be buried again ",1
"Even before that testimony , however , the fall of McCarrick and the Pennsylvania grand jury report had already presented a Sisyphean task to neo - Catholic apologists for the decrepit Novus Ordo status quo and the ill - starred Council that launched its installation ",1
"Yet there is little doubt they will continue the same polemic that for nearly sixty years has doggedly defended every one of the ruinous “ reforms ” that have resulted in a debacle without equal in Church history , even considering the Arian crisis of the 4th century ",1
"Those “ reforms ” included abandonment of the Vatican ’s strict pre - conciliar instruction ( 1961 ) that “ advancement to religious vows and ordination should be barred to those who are afflicted with evil tendencies to homosexuality or pederasty , since for them the common life and the priestly ministry would constitute serious dangers ",1
"” Today , neo - Catholic commentators , cowed by the demands of political correctness , refuse to state the simple truth that homosexuality is a perversion that precludes ordination as does any other grave psychological disorder ",1
Kill the Messenger ,1
I suspect that not even Viganò ’s historic testimony will change the neo - Catholic position ,1
"Quite the contrary , I would expect the neo - Catholic commentariat either to ignore Viganò ’s witness , explain away his revelations or , failing that , make every effort to smear the man ",1
The campaign to discredit Archbishop Viganò began instantaneously on the Catholic left wing ,0
"Only hours after Viganò ’s sworn testimony appeared online , the professional Catholic dissident Sean Michael Winters , writing for National Catholic Reporter , smeared the former Apostolic Nuncio to the United States , who holds doctorates in both civil and canon law , as “ a trafficker in conspiracy theories who mixes fact , fiction and venom , ” “ more than a little obsessed with homosexuality”—like Oliver Stone , who “ was obsessed with the grassy knoll”—“a disgruntled former employee ” and “ always a crackpot ",1
"” Without addressing the merits , Winters dismissed Archbishop Viganò ’s “ wild claims ” about bishops who are “ subverting Catholic doctrine on homosexuality ” and accused the Archbishop , along with unnamed other bishops and archbishops , of “ speak[ing ] about gay people with such hatred … ” ",1
"Winters issues the dire warning that “ A putsch is afoot and if the U.S. bishops do not , as a body , stand up to defend the Holy Father in the next 24 hours , we shall be slipping towards schism long before the bishops’ meeting in November ",1
The enemies of Francis have declared war ,0
"” Notice that for Winters it is not the Church or the integrity of her doctrine and discipline that must be defended against enemies , but only Bergoglio and the regime of novelty he is leading to its final extremity ",1
"John Allen ’s instant analysis attempting to impeach Viganò ’s testimony is , as one would expect from him , a bit craftier ",0
"His opinion is : “ Take it seriously , but with a large grain of salt ",1
” Which is just Allen ’s more nuanced way of saying : “ Do n’t believe it ,1
” Allen ’s view is supported by such irrelevancies as the fact that Viganò ’s account implicates “ no fewer than 32 senior churchmen ” ( so what ? ,0
") , that he “ has a history ” of “ innuendo and conspiracy theories ” ( a gratuitous assertion unsupported by evidence of falsity ) , that he allegedly quashed an investigation of Archbishop John Nienstedt and ordered evidence destroyed ( an allegation Viganò has immediately and categorically denied with conclusive supporting documents , but in any event a tuo quoque fallacy ) and that Allen has “ the impression that all this was orchestrated with a political agenda in mind ” ( the same “ conspiracy theory ” mentality he gratuitously attributes to Viganò ) ",1
"Mark Shea , easily the most insufferable of the neo - Catholic polemicists , has quickly followed Winters and Allen in trying to cast doubt on Viganò ’s claims ",1
"Ignoring eleven pages of detail , written and published under oath , he suggests there has been no “ Documentation ",1
Evidence ,0
Proof ,0
"” Yes , Francis should resign if Viganò ’s allegations are true , Shea admits — a stunning concession coming from him ",1
"Yet , making no attempt to refute Viganò ’s account on the merits , he tries to wave it all aside with his usual mode of argument — puerile mockery : “ But at present , the eagerness of the Greatest Catholics of All Time to believe and repeat everything their itching ears want to hear about this Pope whose living guts they have hated from the moment of his election only tells in his favor , not against it ",1
"” Shea ’s ever - expanding opus of digital invective never seems to rise above this sort of crude ad hominem attack : Well , if those people believe it , it ca n’t be true ",1
"The neo - Catholic propaganda mill will have a very difficult time smearing this witness , however ",1
"Speaking to Catholic News Agency , Monsignor Jean - François Lantheaume , who served as first Counsellor of the Nunciature in Washington , confirmed that “ Viganò said the truth ",1
"That ’s all , ” when he stated in his sworn account that Nuncio Pietro Sambi conveyed to McCarrick at the Nunciature in Washington the sanctions that had been imposed on him by Pope Benedict — sanctions Bergoglio ignored for five years until forced to act by a worldwide storm of outrage ",1
"Furthermore , a series of prelates has vouched for Viganò ’s character and credibility : ",0
#NAME?,0
"- Bishop Thomas Olmsted of Phoenix , Arizona , issued a statement affirming that he has known Viganò for 39 years , has “ always known and respected him as a man of truthfulness , faith and integrity ” and that his testimony should “ be taken seriously by all … ” ",1

"- [ And just two days ago , Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone of San Francisco wrote a letter to his faithful which """""""" speaks to Vigano 's integrity and sincere love of the Church ",1
""""""""" ] ",0
"In another setback for the propaganda machine gearing up to impeach Viganò ’s testimony , the Catholic Herald has just reported that Cardinal Wuerl must have known full well from Viganò himself that McCarrick was under Pope Benedict ’s papal sanctions on account of his sexual misconduct because , as an Archdiocesan spokesman now confirms , at Viganò ’s request as then papal nuncio Wuerl had to cancel a public appearance by McCarrick not long before Bergoglio ’s election ",1
"The Herald asks the obvious question : “ [ I]f Cardinal Wuerl was unaware of the sanctions , and unaware of the reason for them , why did he ask no questions of the nuncio regarding the reason for his demand ? ” The question answers itself , and Viganò ’s testimony on this critical point stands confirmed by Wuerl ’s own spokesman ",1
Bergoglio Pleads the Fifth ,0
"Bergoglio himself , however , has already precluded any attempt to impeach Viganò ’s testimony ",0
"During the return flight from Dublin after the “ World Meeting of Familes , ” he was asked to comment on Viganò ’s allegations that he had informed Bergoglio of McCarrick ’s crimes in 2013 as well as the sanctions imposed by Benedict ",0
Bergoglio declined to incriminate himself : ,0
Read the statement carefully yourselves and make your own judgment ,0
I am not going to say a word about this ,0
"I believe that the statement speaks for itself , and you all have sufficient journalistic ability to draw conclusions ",0
It is an act of trust ,0
"When a little time goes by , and you have drawn conclusions , perhaps I will speak about it , but I would like your professional maturity to do this work ",0
"It will do you all good , really ",0
"In other words , as Bergoglio can not deny the allegations without lying , he will say nothing at all about them in the hope they will go away — with the help of sycophants in the Vatican press corps and shifty polemicists like Shea , who expects his readers to swallow his explanation that Bergoglio ’s refusal to say anything in his defense when asked point blank about the charges against him “ seems to me to obviously be the reply of somebody who believes the accusations are groundless … ” ",1
Seems to be ,0
Obviously ,0
The American “ Gay ” Church Expansion ,1
"While events have overtaken Faggioli ’s piece , it will remain useful here as a prime example of the neo - Catholic polemic ",0
That polemic seeks to shore up the collapsing Novus Ordo establishment lest it give way to the dreaded traditionalist revival ,1
"But before I address Faggioli ’s latest defense of the indefensible , some background is in order , including a discussion of further key details of Viganò ’s testimony ",0
"First of all , as I predicted 16 years ago , because the Vatican under John Paul II had no intention of enforcing the pre - conciliar ban on admission of homosexuals to the seminary “ a new bumper crop of homosexual ordinands is guaranteed — and with it a new harvest of scandal for the Church ",1
"” That prediction came immediately after the “ pedophile summit ” of 2002 in Rome , which I attended as The Remnant ’s correspondent ",1
"In answer to my question then head of the USCCB , Wilton Gregory , made an explosive admission reportedby the international press : “ it is an ongoing struggle to make sure that the Catholic priesthood is not dominated by homosexual men ",1
"” The struggle , to the extent there even was one , obviously has been lost ",1
"Sixteen years later , the homosexual predator McCarrick has finally been exposed to the world , stripped of his cardinal ’s hat and deprived of any ministry , but only after international media coverage of the Vatican ’s semi - secret finding that McCarrick had raped a teenage altar boy 47 years ago ",1
"If not for that one case , McCarrick ’s sixty years of homosexual debauchery might well have gone unpunished in this world and he would have died still possessed of all the phony honors that had been heaped upon him throughout his career as a parasite in the Body of Christ , including the favor shown to him by Bergoglio ",1
"The telling details of Archbishop Viganò ’s testimony concerning Bergoglio ’s friendly relations with McCarrick before he finally had to cut him loose — details conveniently ignored by Winters , Allen and Shea — are utterly devastating to any defense of Bergoglio ",1
This would explain why he will not a “ say a word about ” Viganò ’s charges against him ,0
"The Archbishop reveals , as already noted , that Pope Benedict imposed sanctions on McCarrick under which he “ was to leave the seminary where he was living , he was forbidden to celebrate [ Mass ] in public , to participate in public meetings , to give lectures , to travel , with the obligation of dedicating himself to a life of prayer and penance ",0
"” Viganò further reveals that those sanctions were communicated to McCarrick by then Apostolic Nuncio to the United States , Pietro Sambi , but were also repeated by Viganò himself when he succeeded Sambi as Nuncio : ",0
I repeated them to Cardinal McCarrick at my first meeting with him at the Nunciature ,0
"The Cardinal , muttering in a barely comprehensible way , admitted that he had perhaps made the mistake of sleeping in the same bed with some seminarians at his beach house , but he said this as if it had no importance ",1
"Viganò testifies that on June 23 , 2013 , he obtained a private audience with Bergoglio after having encountered McCarrick at the Pope ’s residence three days earlier , during which encounter McCarrick had told him with an air of triumph : “ The Pope received me yesterday , tomorrow I am going to China ” ( evidently to assist in negotiating Bergoglio ’s planned sellout of China ’s underground Catholics to the Communist dictators of Beijing ) ",1
Viganò wanted to know why McCarrick had apparently been relieved of the sanctions ,0
During the audience Bergoglio queried : “ What is Cardinal McCarrick like ? ” and Viganò replied with the truth Bergoglio obviously did not want to hear : ,0
"I answered him with complete frankness and , if you want , with great naiveté : “ Holy Father , I do n’t know if you know Cardinal McCarrick , but if you ask the Congregation for Bishops there is a dossier this thick about him ",0
He corrupted generations of seminarians and priests and Pope Benedict ordered him to withdraw to a life of prayer and penance ,0
"” The Pope did not make the slightest comment about those very grave words of mine and did not show any expression of surprise on his face , as if he had already known the matter for some time , and he immediately changed the subject ",1
"But then , what was the Pope ’s purpose in asking me that question : “ What is Cardinal McCarrick like ? ” He clearly wanted to find out if I was an ally of McCarrick or not … ",1
"It was also clear that , from the time of Pope Francis ’s election , McCarrick , now free from all constraints , had felt free to travel continuously , to give lectures and interviews … ",0
"He [ Bergoglio ] knew from at least June 23 , 2013 [ the date of the audience with Viganò ] that McCarrick was a serial predator ",1
"Although he knew that he was a corrupt man , he covered for him to the bitter end ; indeed , he made McCarrick ’s advice his own , which was certainly not inspired by sound intentions and for love of the Church ",1
"It was only when he was forced by the report of the abuse of a minor , again on the basis of media attention , that he took action to save his image in the media ",0
[ all emphasis in original ] ,0
"Before his long overdue fall McCarrick , as Bergoglio ’s “ trusted counselor , ” had been instrumental in cementing into place the homosexual - friendly status quo of the American episcopate that oppresses and defrauds the faithful ",1
"It was McCarrick , noted Marco Tosatti , who was behind the elevation of Blase Cupich to the key position of Archbishop of Chicago , where Cupich has since promoted the homosexual subversion of Father James Martin ",0
"And Viganò now confirms Tosatti ’s allegation : “ The appointments of Blase Cupich to Chicago and Joseph W. Tobin to Newark were orchestrated by McCarrick , Maradiaga and Wuerl , united by a wicked pact of abuses by the first , and at least of coverup of abuses by the other two ",1
Their names were not among those presented by the Nunciature for Chicago and Newark ,0
"” That is , the normal process was circumvented for these appointments ",0
"Remnant readers may recall that I spotted Cupich back in 2002 , when he was the obscure Bishop of Rapid City , South Dakota , as an example of what was coming in the Novus Ordo : accelerated degeneration ",1
"As I wrote back then , with the likes of Cupich in view : ",0
Cupich is the very model of a Novus Ordo bishop ,0
He is the very exemplar of the crisis we must still endure … ,1
"Let the thing die of its own excesses , for as the “ little synod ” [ the 2002 “ pedophile summit ” ] demonstrates , the men who control this establishment will never restore it to anything resembling the vibrant Church that a long line of militant , uncompromising Popes delivered into their hands at Vatican II ",1
"For heaven ’s sake , the men who govern the Church today require a Vatican summit meeting to agonize over whether serial child molesters should be defrocked ",1
"From the Vatican on down , through deliberate decisions and criminal neglect , the servitors of Vatican II have laid waste to the liturgy , the perennial clarity of Catholic teaching , the Church ’s militant opposition to worldly thinking , the traditional formation in seminaries , the religious orders , the missions , the trust of the faithful in their own priests — in short , the very life of the Church — and dare to call it a renewal ",1
We must no longer subsidize the malpractice of the architects of ruin ,1
Nor must we join the neo - Catholics in their mindless applause when one of these incompetents attempts to repoint a brick or two in the crumbling façade they have erected to obscure the Church of old ,1
"As for William ( “ nighty - night baby ! ” ) Tobin , after McCarrick had arranged for him to become Archbishop of Newark , Tobin , another episcopal booster of Martin ’s pro - homosexual propaganda , promptly sponsored a “ gay pilgrimage ” to his cathedral in Newark ",1
"And it was McCarrick who obtained the cardinal ’s hat for his roommate of six years , Kevin Farrell , whom he consecrated a bishop ",0
"Farrell , yet another promoter of Martin ’s homosexual activism , arranged for Martin to “ welcome ‘ gay’ families ” at the “ World Meeting of Families ” in Dublin from which Bergoglio has just returned ",1
"Finally , there is the appointment of the “ pro - gay ” Robert McElroy as Bishop of San Diego , concerning which Viganò reveals : “ The appointment of McElroy in San Diego was also orchestrated from above , with an encrypted peremptory order to me as Nuncio , by Cardinal Parolin : ‘ Reserve the See of San Diego for McElroy.’ McElroy was also well aware of McCarrick ’s abuses , as can be seen from a letter sent to him by Richard Sipe on July 28 , 2016 ",1
"” Like Cupich , Tobin and Farrell , McElroy is an avid promoter of Martin ’s homosexual subversion of the Church , calling opposition to Martin symptomatic of a “ cancer of vilification [ that ] is seeping into the institutional life of the church ",1
” ,0
"Emboldened by the certainty that he will face no discipline whatsoever , Martin , now backed by “ Cupich , Tobin , Farrell and McElroy , ” as Viganò testifies , is urging all the “ gay priests ” to “ come out , ” including those ordained since the useless “ pedophile summit ” presided over by none other than McCarrick as the classic fox in charge of the hen house ",1
But Bergoglio has also lent his own authority to Martin ’s effort to mainstream homosexuality in the Church ,0
"As Viganò notes , it was Bergoglio who made Martin a “ Consultor of the Secretariat for Communications , ” even though he is a “ well - known activist who promotes the LGBT agenda , chosen to corrupt the young people who will soon gather in Dublin for the World Meeting of Families … ” ",1
"“ Father ” Martin now confidently declares , sixteen years after the “ pedophile summit , ” that “ The idea of a purge of gay priests is both ridiculous and dangerous ",1
Any purge would empty parishes and religious orders of the thousands of priests and bishops who lead healthy lives of service and faithful lives of celibacy ,1
” ,0
"Martin thus revels in smug certitude that the future of the universal Church is in the hands of legions of intrinsically disordered homosexual bishops and priests and their homosexual successors , who will perpetuate an existing worldwide homosexual network , and that there is absolutely nothing we can or should do about it ",1
"A Worldwide Network of Corruption , Beginning at the Top ",0
None of the foregoing is meant to suggest that the homosexual invasion of the Catholic hierarchy is confined to American prelates and priests ,0
The spread of clerical sodomy has not respected national boundaries but rather extends throughout the Church under the eyes of a Vatican apparatus that is itself thoroughly infested with homosexuals ,1
"This is thanks in large measure to Bergoglio , who made a flagrantly active homosexual , Monsignor Battista Ricca , “ prelate of the gay lobby , ” no less than head of his papal household ",1
"Moreover , it was Bergoglio ’s right hand man , Cardinal Maradiaga , who sheltered his friend , Juan José Pineda , auxiliary Bishop of Tegucigalpa , from any discipline over his notorious homosexual liaisons with seminarians in that diocese ",0
"When an apostolic visitation , compelled by mounting public pressure , confirmed the charges against Pineda , he was forced to resign , even as Maradiaga dismissed the incontestable proofs against him as “ slander ",0
"” Viganò notes that “ the only thing that has been made public is that his resignation has simply been accepted , thus making any possible responsibility of his and Maradiaga vanish into nowhere ",1
” ,0
"Despite the fall of his friend Pineda , Maradiaga continues todefend and protect the homosexual corruption of his own seminary , involving incontrovertible evidence of rampant sodomy among the seminarians he refuses to dismiss , rejecting all the evidence as “ gossip ",1
"” Concerning Maradiaga , who is also mired in financial corruption for which he offers no credible explanation , Viganò provides this withering assessment of the man and his relation to Bergoglio : ",1
"In a team effort with Cardinal Rodriguez Maradiaga , [ McCarrick ] had become the kingmaker for appointments in the Curia and the United States , and the most listened to advisor in the Vatican for relations with the Obama administration ",1
"This is how one explains that , as members of the Congregation for Bishops , the Pope replaced Cardinal Burke with Wuerl and immediately appointed Cupich right after he was made a cardinal ",0
"With these appointments the Nunciature in Washington was now out of the picture in the appointment of bishops … .. By now the faithful have well understood Maradiaga ’s strategy : insult the victims to save himself , lie to the bitter end to cover up a chasm of abuses of power , of mismanagement in the administration of Church property , and of financial disasters even against close friends , as in the case of the Ambassador of Honduras Alejandro Valladares , former Dean of the Diplomatic Corps to the Holy See … ",1
"The Pope defends his man , Cardinal Rodriguez Maradiaga , to the bitter end , as he had done in Chile with Bishop Juan de la Cruz Barros , whom he himself had appointed Bishop of Osorno against the advice of the Chilean Bishops ",0
"First , he insulted the abuse victims ",0
"Then , only when he was forced by the media , and a revolt by the Chilean victims and faithful , did he recognize his error and apologize , while stating that he had been misinformed , causing a disastrous situation for the Church in Chile , but continuing to protect the two Chilean Cardinals Errazuriz and Ezzati ",0
"On the very day Archbishop Viganò ’s testimony was made public , Sandro Magister summed up the entire state of affairs in the Church universal after decades of unrestricted homosexual migration into the hierarchy , to which Bergoglio has contributed mightily : “ From the seminaries , to the clergy , to the bishops , to the cardinals , homosexuals are present at all levels , by the thousand ",1
” ,0
"Archbishop Viganò now provides his own decisive summary of the situation , based on firsthand experience with a now endemic homosexual corruption of the Church : ",1
"Janet Smith , Professor of Moral Theology at the Sacred Heart Major Seminary in Detroit , recently wrote : “ The problem of clergy abuse can not be resolved simply by the resignation of some bishops , and even less so by bureaucratic directives ",1
The deeper problem lies in homosexual networks within the clergy which must be eradicated ,1
"” These homosexual networks , which are now widespread in many dioceses , seminaries , religious orders , etc ",0
", act under the concealment of secrecy and lies with the power of octopus tentacles , and strangle innocent victims and priestly vocations , and are strangling the entire Church ",1
[ emphasis added ] ,0
Defending the Council by Defending the Homosexual Status Quo ,0
"At this moment , the entire Novus Ordo regime of novelty is threatened with collapse on account of its homosexual corruption , and voices throughout the Catholic world are now echoing Archbishop Viganò ’s call for Bergoglio ’s resignation , including Laura Ingraham : “ Too little , too late from Pope Francis in Ireland ",1
I stand with Archbishop Carlo Vigano ,0
Time for the laity to demand a new Shepherd ,0
"” Even Michael Voris , in a highly amusing example of leading from behind , has finally abandoned his absurd refusal to criticize this pontificate and now declares with a screaming headline : “ Pope Francis Must Resign ",1
” ,0
"Nearly three years ago , seeing what was certainly coming on the disastrous course Bergoglio had already clearly established , this newspaper published a petition which states : “ We your subjects respectfully petition Your Holiness to change course for the good of the Church and the welfare of souls ",1
"Failing this , would it not be better for Your Holiness to renounce the Petrine office than to preside over what threatens to be a catastrophic compromise of the Church ’s integrity ? ” Our petition was of course dismissed as “ ridiculous ” by the neo - Catholic commentariat ",1
"Today , our ridiculous suggestion is the stuff of mainstream news ",0
"From the neo - Catholic perspective , the events of recent days present a terrifying prospect : the final collapse of the Novus Ordo establishment , an end to the conciliar aggiornamento and a revival of integral Tradition , which growing numbers of young people are seeking ",1
"Hence even before Archbishop Viganò had come forward , commentators like Faggioli were already sounding the neo - Catholic air raid siren ",1
Faggioli fretted that “ [ t]he abuse scandal and delegitimization of the episcopate has created a great power vacuum in the Church ” that could be filled by the “ neo - traditionalist Catholicism of the younger generations of American Catholics ” who “ attack American bishops and cardinals close to Pope Francis ,1
"” Accordingly , he rushed to the defense of Bergoglio and his corrupt regime against “ a radicalization of religious conservatism in the neo - traditionalism sense ... ” ",1
"For Faggioli , not only would Bergoglio ’s resignation be unthinkable , so also would a purge of the homosexual and pro - homosexual prelates Bergoglio and his Vatican henchmen have systematically enabled ",1
"The Pope , he argues , is not “ the CEO of the Catholic Church world , and the bishops as its managers whom the Pope can simply fire ",1
"” No , Bergoglio can not “ simply fire ” bishops ",0
"Except whenever he pleases , as we have seen again and again with the conservative bishops and even Cardinals ( Burke and Müller ) he has sacked because their conservatism offended him or one of his friends , prompting even Crux to ask : “ Does Pope Francis have an enemies list ? ” Then again , Francis even obtained the removal of his own “ trusted counselor ” McCarrick from the College of Cardinals , albeit only when forced to act due to worldwide condemnation in the media ",1
"So , according to Faggioli , the same Pope who sacks conservative bishops and cardinals according to his pleasure and has just removed a cardinal from the College of Cardinals in an unprecedented disciplinary act under fire from the media , is somehow powerless to dismiss Modernist bishops who have created an obscene “ gay culture ” in the Church and replace them with orthodox , normal heterosexual males ",1
"Francis can not “ simply fire ” even Cardinal Wuerl , who covered up crimes of homosexual predation by the priests he transferred elsewhere while Archbishop of Pittsburgh , and who authorized payment of $ 900,000 in hush money to bury sexual abuse claims against a homosexual priest involved in the production of child pornography ",1
"Wuerl , says Faggioli , “ faces a complex situation : on the one hand Wuerl was not afraid of clashing with the tribunal over the Apostolic Signatura in the Vatican which wanted to readmit a priest from the Pittsburgh diocese to ministry … while in other cases he seems to have collaborated in covering up some cases … It is a very difficult position also because Wuerl became a symbol … beyond the specific accusations against him , from which he could not publicly defend himself ",0
” ,0
"In other words , because his situation is “ complex ” Wuerl , unlike McCarrick , should remain a cardinal and the Archbishop of Washington , DC , thus maintaining a key bulwark against the “ neo - traditionalist ” threat ",1
"Yet , as the Pennsylvania grand jury report documents , Wuerl assisted McCarrick in the coverup of his crimes and now brazenly lies about it ",1
Here too Viganò ’s testimony sheds light on the darkness : ,1
… ,0
"I myself brought up the subject [ of McCarrick ] with Cardinal Wuerl on several occasions , and I certainly did n’t need to go into detail because it was immediately clear to me that he was fully aware of it ",0
"I also remember in particular the fact that I had to draw his attention to it , because I realized that in an archdiocesan publication , on the back cover in color , there was an announcement inviting young men who thought they had a vocation to the priesthood to a meeting with Cardinal McCarrick ",0
"I immediately phoned Cardinal Wuerl , who expressed his surprise to me , telling me that he knew nothing about that announcement and that he would cancel it ",0
"If , as he now continues to state , he knew nothing of the abuses committed by McCarrick and the measures taken by Pope Benedict , how can his answer be explained ? ",1
"His recent statements that he knew nothing about it , even though at first he cunningly referred to compensation for the two victims , are absolutely laughable ",1
"The Cardinal lies shamelessly and prevails upon his Chancellor , Monsignor Antonicelli , to lie as well ",1
Cardinal Wuerl also clearly lied on another occasion ,0
"Following a morally unacceptable event authorized by the academic authorities of Georgetown University , I brought it to the attention of its President , Dr. John DeGioia , sending him two subsequent letters ",0
"Before forwarding them to the addressee , so as to handle things properly , I personally gave a copy of them to the Cardinal with an accompanying letter I had written ",0
The Cardinal told me that he knew nothing about it ,0
"However , he failed to acknowledge receipt of my two letters , contrary to what he customarily did ",1
I subsequently learned that the event at Georgetown had taken place for seven years ,0
But the Cardinal knew nothing about it ! ,0
"Cardinal Wuerl , well aware of the continuous abuses committed by Cardinal McCarrick and the sanctions imposed on him by Pope Benedict , transgressing the Pope ’s order , also allowed him to reside at a seminary in Washington D.C. ",0
"In doing so , he put other seminarians at risk ",1
[ emphasis in original ] ,0
"What really concerns Faggioli and those who think like him is not Wuerl and his “ complex situation , ” which is not complex at all ",0
"Rather , what he views with alarm as an “ essential element ” of the context in which Wuerl operates is that “ scandals are also the opportunity for the neo - traditionalist Catholicism of the younger generations of American Catholics to attack American bishops and cardinals close to Pope Francis … ",0
"” Better a thousand septuagenarian Wuerls in their lavish sties of corruption , financed by the faithful , than a single , young neo - traditionalist prelate ! ",1
But what exactly is a neo - traditionalist ? ,0
"Quite simply : an orthodox Catholic who has had enough of the homosexual - infested regime of novelty imposed on the Church by the old men of the Council , Bergoglio merely being the latest , the highest placed , and one of the last ",1
"As Faggioli puts it : “ In the last fifteen years , the American Catholic Church has been traversed by a radicalization of religious conservatism in the neo - traditionalism sense , especially in the younger generations of priests and intellectuals ",1
They interpret the current abuse crisis as fruit of the mistakes of the Council itself and not only of the post - Council … ” ,1
"Just as Faggioli fears , many in the up - and - coming generation of Catholic clergy and laity recognize the obvious : that the conciliar texts , for all their prolix repetition of traditional teaching , opened the way to ecclesial disaster ",1
"Because in those texts — above all Gaudium et Spes , Dignitatis Humanae , Unitatis Redintegratio , Nostra Aetate and Sacrosanctum Concilium — the Council verbally prostrated itself before “ the modern world ” and the practitioners of other religions while authorizing Bugnini ( Secretary of the liturgical Preparatory Commission that drafted what would become Sacrosanctum Concilium ) to begin demolition of the sacred liturgy that was the very foundation Catholic of orthodoxy and orthopraxis ",1
"To quote Paul VI , then in the depths of his conciliar delirium at the Council ’s close : ",1
"But one must realize that this council , which exposed itself to human judgment , insisted very much more upon this pleasant side of man , rather than on his unpleasant one ",0
Its attitude was very much and deliberately optimistic ,0
A wave of affection and admiration flowed from the council over the modern world of humanity … ,1
"Instead of depressing diagnoses , encouraging remedies ; instead of direful prognostics , messages of trust issued from the council to the present - day world ",0
"The modern world ’s values were not only respected but honored , its efforts approved , its aspirations purified and blessed ",1
[ emphasis added ] ,0
"Thus did Paul describe the conciliar “ opening to the world ” through which the world promptly invaded the Church , including large numbers of homosexuals who should never have been admitted to the seminary ",1
"In sum , Faggioli is representative of the thinking that requires defense of a homosexualized clergy if only for the reason that tradition - minded Catholics can not be allowed to take their place : “ This neo - traditionalist Catholicism believes that sexual abuses are committed only by homosexual clergy … and that the crisis of abuse can be resolved by a kind of Catholic Jacobinism that should eliminate all bishops and priests minimally engaged in dialogue with modern culture , and replaced by a young clergy marked by personal sanctity but also by a fascination for a mythical Middle Ages and the rejection of a Church - world relationship based on a principle of reality ",1
” ,0
"Rather than “ young clergy marked by personal sanctity , ” the neo - Catholic mentality Faggioli exemplifies prefers that homosexual priests and bishops be kept in place in order to continue the “ dialogue with modern culture ",1
” It is not the integrity of the Faith that matters but only perpetuation of the post - conciliar regime of novelty ,0
Any abandonment of the regime must be viewed as ecclesiastical treason—“Catholic Jacobinism”—if not criminal activity ,1
Faggioli would probably be more inclined to civil or criminal prosecution of “ Catholic Jacobins ” for “ hate speech ” than Novus Ordo bishops for their complicity in covering up homosexual rapes ,0
"“ Homosexuality in the clergy exists and is a matter that must be addressed , ” Faggioli fleetingly acknowledges toward the end of his piece , “ but the abuse crisis can not be resolved by making homosexuals within the Church the scapegoat of a scandal that has ancient roots , well before Vatican Council II ",1
” And how does the Church “ address ” a massive infestation by homosexual priests and prelates without removing them from authority and ensuring that they can not promote homosexual successors for generation after generation ? ,1
Faggioli has no answer because what he is really arguing — the final beachhead of the neo - Catholic defense of their disintegrating regime — is that homosexuals in the hierarchy must remain in authority as an indispensable seawall against a “ neo - traditionalist ” storm surge ,1
Faggioli ’s argument demonstrates that neo - Catholicism has never been about making the authentic Faith more appealing to a “ modern world ” founded precisely on a rejection of the Church ’s authority ,1
It is not about the Faith at all ,1
"Rather , it is an ideological movement dedicated to the face - saving defense of a catastrophic failure in ecclesial innovation that has corrupted the human element of the Church in practically every department ",1
"For people like Faggioli , indeed for the tradition - hating Pope they blindly defend , the one thing to be feared is that more and more faithful will recognize the neo - Catholic polemic for what it is — a fraud — and begin demanding a return of everything the regime of novelty has stolen from the life of the Church ",1
"That is exactly what a growing number of Catholics are now doing , as even the secular press recognized less than three months before Bergoglio began his tyrannical reign ",1
"In this respect , what the neo - Catholics are defending at bottom is themselves — that is , the reputations they have all staked on their defense of the indefensible against the traditionalists they have arrogantly mocked and marginalized for decades only to see , to their horror , that traditionalism is ever more vindicated as the scandals of the Novus Ordo mount under this reckless Pope to an unsustainable , indeed apocalyptic , level ",1
A return to integral Tradition is the threat that Faggioli sees as coming particularly from the young ,0
"Irony of ironies , he is now reduced to defending what is old and tired and corrupt against a restoration , led largely by a youthful vanguard , of what is ever ancient but ever new ",1
"For some , it seems , no price is too great — not even the good of the Church — to avoid the personal ignominy of being seen on the wrong side of history ",0
Conclusion : The Fatima Connection ,0
"Long before the arrival of Bergoglio in Rome , the successive Vatican Secretaries of State , Angelo Sodano and Tarcisio Bertone , were instrumental in advancing the homosexual corruption of the Novus Ordo establishment ",0
"As to Bertone and Sodano , Viganò provides further vital testimony : ",0
"Nuncio Sambi ’s report [ on McCarrick ’s sexual abuse ] , with all the attachments , was sent to Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone , as Secretary of State ",0
"My two above - mentioned memos of December 6 , 2006 and May 25 , 2008 , were also presumably handed over to him by the Substitute ",0
"As already mentioned , the Cardinal had no difficulty in insistently presenting for the episcopate candidates known to be active homosexuals — I cite only the well - known case of Vincenzo de Mauro , who was appointed Archbishop - Bishop of Vigevano and later removed because he was undermining his seminarians — and in filtering and manipulating the information he conveyed to Pope Benedict … ",1
Cardinal Angelo Sodano was Secretary of State until September 2006 : all information [ concerning McCarrick ] was communicated to him ,0
"In November 2000 , Nunzio Montalvo sent him his report , passing on to him the aforementioned letter from Father Boniface Ramsey in which he denounced the serious abuses committed by McCarrick ",0
It is known that Sodano tried to cover up the Father Maciel scandal to the end ,0
"He even removed the Nuncio in Mexico City , Justo Mullor , who refused to be an accomplice in his scheme to cover Maciel , and in his place appointed Sandri , then - Nuncio to Venezuela , who was willing to collaborate in the cover - up ",0
"Sodano even went so far as to issue a statement to the Vatican press office in which a falsehood was affirmed , that is , that Pope Benedict had decided that the Maciel case should be considered closed ",0
"Benedict reacted , despite Sodano ’s strenuous defense , and Maciel was found guilty and irrevocably condemned ",1
"It is no coincidence that , as I detail in my book on the Third Secret of Fatima , Sodano and Bertone have also taken the leading role in suppressing the integral Secret and reducing the Message of Fatima in general to a generic prescription for personal piety , stripped of its prophetic and admonitory content regarding the epochal malfeasance and corruption of the upper hierarchy to which they belong ",1
"Concerning my book , Archbishop Pietro Sambi , Viganò ’s predecessor as Nuncio in Washington , whom Viganò’ credits with diligently reporting McCarrick ’s crimes to the Vatican and conveying Benedict ’s sanctions to McCarrick , made some very revealing comments during an interview with Robert Moynihan , published posthumously six years ago in Inside the Vatican : ",0
"We were discussing the Third Secret of Fatima , the allegations that the Vatican has not published the entire text of the Third Secret as revealed to Sister Lucia , and the response of Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone , the Vatican secretary of state , in a book where Bertone states that there is nothing more to be revealed ",0
"Sambi said , “ Excuse me ",0
"” He got up , went out of the room , and came back with a book ",0
"“ Here , ” he said ",0
“ Do you know this book ? ,0
You should read it ,0
” It was Christopher Ferrara 's The Secret Still Hidden ,0
"“ Wait , ” I said ",0
"“ You are the Pope ’s representative in the US , and you are urging me to read a book that questions what the secretary of state wrote ? ” Sambi replied , “ All I am saying is that there are interesting things worth reading in this book ",1
"And in the end , we are all after the truth , are n’t we ? ",0
The truth is the important thing ... ” ,0
The truth is indeed the important thing ,0
"And the truth about our situation is revealed in that still - hidden part of the Secret to whose contents Pope Benedict alluded during his pilgrimage to Fatima in 2010 , identifying elements that do not appear at all in the obscure vision published back in 2000 , which Sodano and Bertone tried to pass of as the entirety of the Secret at the same time they were covering up homosexual corruption in high places : ",0
"As for the new things which we can find in this message today , there is also the fact that attacks on the Pope and the Church come not only from without , but the sufferings of the Church come precisely from within the Church , from the sin existing within the Church ",1
"This too is something that we have always known , but today we are seeing it in a really terrifying way : that the greatest persecution of the Church comes not from her enemies without , but arises from sin within the Church , and that the Church thus has a deep need to relearn penance , to accept purification , to learn forgiveness on the one hand , but also the need for justice ",1
[ emphasis added ] ,0
I believe that Archbishop Viganò ’s precious testimony is a sign that Heaven itself is now responding to the “ need for justice ” in the Church ,1
"Whether or not justice involves the resignation of the most wayward Pope in Church history , the inevitable season of justice will culminate in the triumph of the Immaculate Heart of Mary and the Church ’s restoration ",1
"This will be a final victory over the enemies within and their apologists , such as Faggioli , who , in typical neo - Catholic style , imperiously scoffs at the notion of “ a young clergy marked by personal sanctity but also by a fascination for a mythical Middle Ages ” and busies himself defending an unsalvageable mass of corruption he dares to describe as “ a Church - world relationship based on a principle of reality ",1
” ,0
I can only conclude by making my own these closing words of Archbishop Viganò : ,0
France Gives Muslim Killer of Elderly Jewish Woman a Pass ,1
Every other Muslim terrorist or killer in Europe has his actions blamed on mental illness or drug use ,1
This just continues the pattern ,0
I wrote about the murder of Sarah Halimi last year ,0
Sarah Lucy Halimi was thrown out of the window of the third floor Paris apartment while she begged her Muslim killer to spare her life ,1
The 66-year - old director of an Orthodox Jewish nursery was woken from her sleep when she was violently beaten by her twenty something Muslim neighbor who then dragged her to the window ,1
She died on the street outside the building where she had lived for thirty years ,0
"The killer had allegedly shouted , “ Allahu Akbar ” ",0
"In the tragic comedy of denial that every Islamic terrorism investigation inevitably becomes , the authorities are still hunting around for his motiv Yonathan Halimi , Sarah Lucy ’s son , describes the killer ’s family as being known for its anti - Semitism ",1
""""""""" One day , one of the killer 's sisters pushed my sister down the stairs , and the next time she called her a dirty Jew , """""""" he described ",1
"Sarah ’s brother said that the killer called Sarah and her daughter , “ dirty Jews ” ",1
The authorities stonewalled at every turn ,1
"And , predictably , the killer gets a pass ",0
Allahu Akbar usually means motive unknown ,1
The 28-year - old Muslim man confessed to the killing and was heard shouting “ Allahu Akbar ” and calling Halimi “ Satan ” shortly before throwing her out the window of her three - story apartment ,1
"In January , Traore was determined to be fit to stand trial ",0
He was placed in a psychiatric hospital for weeks after his arrest in the April 2017 killing despite having no history of mental illness ,0
"But a judge requested a second series of tests , which determined that the Malian immigrant was not able to stand trial , 20 Minutes reported Wednesday ",0
This tired farce has dragged on ,1
Kobili Traore was hit with hate crimes charges ,1
Then they were dropped ,0
The authorities allowed him to commit the crime ,1
Now they 're letting him get away with it ,0
"Three minutes later , a unit of the Anti - Crime Brigade ( BAC ) — who happened to be patrolling the area — took up position in front of Diara ’s door ",0
They heard Kobili Traore chanting Muslim prayers and Koranic verses ,0
"Unsure about the situation and the potential threats to the family , they asked for reinforcements ",0
Additional policemen arrived quickly ,0
"However , for some unclear reason , the BAC unit still refrained from breaking in ",0
"In the meantime , Kobili Traore put on new clothes and climbed out of the window to reach Sarah Halimi ’s apartment , which was at the same level as Diara Traore ’s ",0
He allegedly assaulted the Jewish woman and hit her mercilessly ,1
From time to time he resumed Koranic recitation ,0
"Many neighbours , woken by the old woman ’s screams or the assaulter ’s religious chanting , called the police Some gave details about the exact location of the assault , the attacker ’s identity , the fact he vilified his victim as a Jewish person and as “ a Satan ” while hitting her , or even — as far as the Muslim neighbours were concerned — the Koranic portions he chanted ",1
Yet the police still failed to storm Sarah Halimi ’s apartment and rescue her ,0
"Eventually , Kobili Traore is claimed to have shouted that the woman was “ mad and about to commit suicide ” , and threw her out of the window ",0
He had time enough to climb back to Diara Traore ’s apartment where he finally was arrested ,0
His hands were covered in blood ,0
There was blood everywhere in his victim ’s apartment ,0
Sure he was crazy ,1
So crazy he tried to contrive an alibi for his crime ,0
Kobili is n't crazy ,1

Muslim Crime Stopper Sofian Zakkout 's New Crush : Anti - Semite Pastor Steve Anderson ,1
"For nearly two millennia , Jews have suffered persecution after persecution at the hands of those who used religion as a vehicle for hate and even mass murder ",1
"Recently , a video clip of anti - Semitic pastor Steve Anderson – making the claim that Jews have experienced such abuse because they have somehow been cursed – wound up on the personal Facebook page of South Florida Muslim leader Sofian Zakkout ",1
"According to Zakkout , who sits on the boards of two anti - crime groups , Anderson ’s declaration “ makes a lot of sense ",0
"” With statements like this from Zakkout and worse , why would groups committed to fighting crime continue to compromise themselves and sabotage their mission by affiliating with him ? ",0
"Sofian Abdelaziz Zakkout is the President of the American Muslim Association of North America ( AMANA ) , a prominent Islamic organization headquartered in North Miami Beach , Florida ",0
"On January 25th , Zakkout posted onto his personal Facebook page a video clip of a speech made by Steve Anderson , the pastor of the Faithful Word Baptist Church in Tempe , Arizona ",0
Anderson is notorious for calling for the killing of gays to end AIDS ,0
"In the clip , Anderson states the following : “ And the Jews were scattered into all nations for literally 2000 years , right ? ",0
For 1800 sum odd years ,0
"And by the way , everywhere they were scattered , they were persecuted , hated , treated badly ",0
Why ? ,0
‘ Cause God ’s blessing them ? ,0
No ,0
‘ Cause they ’re under the curse of God for having rejected the Lord Jesus Christ ,1
” ,1
"Blaming Jews for the extreme torment they endured for so long , which includes a Nazi Holocaust that took the lives of six million innocent Jews and so many others , is incredibly offensive ",1
"Indeed , statements and beliefs such as Anderson ’s have provoked hatred and persecution of Jews ",0
"Towards the end of the clip , which is less than four minutes in length , Anderson throws the anti - Semitism in people ’s faces ",0
"He zealously states , while drawing laughter from his small audience , “ You say , ‘ Why are you preaching against the Jews?’ Well , do n’t come back next Wednesday night ",0
"Because , next Wednesday night , God ’s wrath is on the Jews even more ! ” ",0
"About the clip , on Facebook , Zakkout wrote above it , “ Makes a lot of sense ! ” Of course , this is coming from someone [ Zakkout ] who regularly refers to Jews as “ monkeys and pigs , ” and in February 2016 , circulated on social media a report claiming that “ the Holocaust was faked ",1
” The report calls the Holocaust “ the biggest lie ever foisted upon humanity ” and was produced by a media outlet which describes Hitler as “ the greatest leader in modern Western history ,1
” ,0
Both Anderson and Zakkout have been denounced by the Anti - Defamation League ( ADL ) for their propagation of anti - Semitism ,0
"In July 2010 , the ADL condemned Zakkout and his group AMANA for featuring an anti - Jewish video produced by former KKK leader and white supremacist David Duke on the AMANA website ",0
The ADL described the video as “ venomous ,1
"” In October 2015 , Zakkout praised Duke , as “ David Duke , a man to believe in ! ” ",1
"Besides posting videos from Steve Anderson and David Duke on his Facebook page , Zakkout also , in July 2017 , posted a four minute clip from a speech made by Nation of Islam ( NOI ) leader Louis Farrakhan ",0
"During the clip , Farrakhan repeatedly labels the Jewish people “ Satan ",1
"” He states , “ Really , they ’re not Jews ",0
"No , that ’s Satan ",1
"You should learn to call them by their real name , ‘ Satan.’ You ’re coming face to face with Satan , the Arch Deceiver , the enemy of God , and the enemy of the righteous ",1
” ,0
"Zakkout is also an ardent supporter of the terrorist organization Hamas , if not a member himself ",0
"In July 2014 , he organized a pro - Hamas rally held outside the Israeli Consulate in downtown Miami ",0
"Rally goers repeatedly shouted , “ We are Hamas ” and “ Let ’s go Hamas ",1
"” After the rally , Zakkout wrote the following in Arabic , above photos from the event : “ Thank God , every day we conquer the American Jews like our conquests over the Jews of Israel ! ” He signed it “ Br ",1
Sofian Zakkout ,0
"” The next month , Zakkout declared in Arabic , """""""" Hamas is in my heart and on my head ",0
""""""""" ",0
"All of the above testifies to hatred and intolerance , but it is even more disturbing given the fact that Zakkout sits on the boards of two anti - crime organizations : Crime Stoppers of Miami - Dade County and Citizens’ Crime Watch of Miami - Dade County ",0
Serving alongside Zakkout on these boards are local politicians and law enforcement officials ,0
"One would think that they would find Zakkout ’s actions and bigotry unacceptable , as well , yet Zakkout continues to serve unchallenged ",0
"If the board members of Crime Stoppers and Citizens’ Crime Watch do not wish to be associated with anti - Semitism or white supremacism or Hamas or Holocaust denial or Steve Anderson or David Duke or Louis Farrakhan , then they must cut ties with Sofian Zakkout ",1
The time is long overdue that these groups maintain their credibility and remain true to their stated missions of protecting and safeguarding the American public ,1
Sofian Zakkout ’s bigoted and radical agenda is antithetical to this and is a documented threat to national security ,1
His presence on the boards of both organizations constitutes an obscene travesty ,1
"Once and for all , these groups need to divorce themselves from Zakkout and repudiate what he stands for ",0

"Pope Francis Denounces “ Murderous Indifference ” To Persecution Of Christians , Of Which He Is A Chief Architect ",1
"Associated Press reported that the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew and other Orthodox Patriarchs met with Pope Francis on Saturday , and that the Pope had some strong words to say about the persecution of Christians in the Middle East ",0
"The Pope could n’t resist an anti - Semitic shot at Israeli “ occupation , ” but he also seemed to denounce Islamic jihad activity , saying : “ So many conflicts have been stoked too by forms of fundamentalism and fanaticism that , under the guise of religion , have profaned God ’s name – which is peace – and persecuted age - old neighbors ",1
"” He decried the “ thirst for profit that surreptitiously exploits oil and gas fields without regard for our common home , with no scruples about the fact that the energy market now dictates the law of coexistence among peoples ! ” ",1
"The Pope lamented the fact that in recent years the Middle East has been “ covered by dark clouds of war , violence and destruction , instances of occupation and varieties of fundamentalism , forced migration and neglect ",0
” And he deplored the fact that “ all this has taken place amid the complicit silence of many ,1
The Middle East has become a land of people who leave their own lands behind ,0

"She hired a Clinton attorney , Lisa Banks ",0
She can produce exactly zero witnesses ,0
Any one of these ( and dozens of other ) circumstances by themselves are not enough to dismiss this allegation outright ,0
"However , taken together as a whole , it ’s far too suspicious to lend it any credibility ",1
"Ladies , you demand to be believed , no matter what ",0
"Well , when every time there 's a man that you do n't like running for public office or being nominated for a position , some woman crawls out from a line of protesters and makes an ambiguous - at - best claim about unwanted sexual advances , it becomes increasingly difficult to take you seriously ",1
"No , an accusation against a man who has been investigated by the FBI six times prior and has 75 women publicly vouching for his character is not going to stop this process ",0
"And guess what , next time a man is nominated to a position who really has committed a crime , people will be that much less likely to believe his accuser ",1
Way to go ! ,1
"By attempting to derail this process with such a pathetic attempt at a smear campaign , you have successfully made it much easier for a real sex offender to point back at this and say , “ look , this is what they do """""""" ! ",1
Women everywhere should be furious ,1
"As an outsider , a regular Joe American , this is what I see : Trump nominates a very well known , well - established judge to the supreme court ",1
Immediately every Democrat publicly stated that they would vote No for his confirmation ,0
"On the other hand , every Republican publicly stated that they would vote Yes ",0
"Currently , there 's more Republicans in Congress than Democrats , which means the guy will be confirmed ",0
There 's an election 2 months away ,0
The Democrats think that they 'll take back the majority of Congress and will thus be able to block Trump 's nomination ,0
All they have to do is delay the confirmation until after the election ,0
"So , they dig up some Trump - hating woman from Kavanaugh ’s past and convince her to say that he assaulted her thinking that such an allegation will surely delay the vote long enough for them to regain control of Congress ",1
It ’s not difficult to see through this plan ,0
These are the facts ,0
This is not my opinion ,0
Everything else is just noise ,1
A popular public school Bible class in West Virginia faces legal challenge ,0
Gym is Trenton Tolliver ’s favorite class ,0
"But the 7-year - old is also a huge fan of the weekly Bible course at Princeton Primary , his public elementary school ",1
He gets to play matching games about Bible stories and listen to classic tales ,0
Noah and the Ark is a favorite ,0
"Adam and Eve and the garden of Eden , of course ",0
"And the story about how their son Cain killed his brother , Abel ",0
"“ That one was a little bit of a surprise , ” Trenton said as he sat with his parents , Brett and Courtney Tolliver , one day this month watching his little sister ’s soccer practice on a lush field in this small town in the mountains of southern West Virginia ",0
"This spring , Bible classes such as Trenton ’s are on the minds of many here in Mercer County ",0
"For decades , the county ’s public schools have offered a weekly Bible class during the school day — 30 minutes at the elementary level and 45 minutes in middle school ",0
"Bible classes on school time are a rarity in public education , but here they are a long - standing tradition ",0
"The program is not mandatory , but almost every child in the district attends ",0
"And there is widespread support for the classes : Parents and community members help raise nearly $ 500,000 a year to pay for the Bible in the Schools program ",0
Now Bible in the Schools is facing a stiff legal challenge ,0
Two county residents with school - age children argue in a lawsuit that the program violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment and the West Virginia constitution ,0
"Filed in January and amended last month by the Freedom From Religion Foundation , the suit charges that the Bible class “ advances and endorses one religion , improperly entangles public schools in religious affairs , and violates the personal consciences of nonreligious and non - Christian parents and students ",0
” ,0
"Supporters are adamant that the weekly class is an elective meant to explore the history and literature of the Bible , not to promote religious belief ",0
“ My experience with it has been very positive ,0
"I ’ve never known of anyone who has been pressured or felt ostracized , ” said the Rev. ",0
"David W. Dockery , senior pastor at First Baptist Church of Princeton ",0
“ Any time God ’s word can be proclaimed is beneficial and is a good thing ,1
” ,0
Trenton ’s parents also find it hard to see why there would be objections ,0
"“ I think it ’s a great program mainly because it ’s the only chance for some of these kids to even see the Bible , ” said Brett Tolliver , 27 ",0
"“ More importantly , I do n’t know who it harms ",0
The kids are n’t forced to be there ,0
” ,0
"Courtney Tolliver , 26 , a teacher in the district , agrees ",0
"“ It ’s not teaching religion , but it teaches character and respect and how important it is to tell the truth , ” she said ",0
“ The kids love it and the ones who do n’t participate are n’t made to feel left out ,0
” ,0
But the plaintiffs in the suit and their backers argue that the program ’s popularity should n’t matter in the face of Supreme Court rulings such as McCollum v. Board of Education in 1948 that have banned public schools from initiating or sponsoring religious activity ,0
The suit alleges that the lessons in the Mercer schools are similar to what a child would hear in Sunday school and that they advocate the Ten Commandments and treat stories in the Bible as historical fact ,0
"The suit quotes from one lesson : “ If all of the Israelites had chosen to follow the Ten Commandments , think of how safe and happy they would have been ",0
” Another lesson asks students to imagine that humans and dinosaurs existed at the same time ,0
It says : “ So picture Adam being able to crawl up on the back of a dinosaur ! ,0
He and Eve could have their own personal water slide ! ,0
Would n’t that be so wild ! ” ,0
The district declined a request to observe one of the classes ,0
"Elizabeth Deal , who describes herself as agnostic , is one of the plaintiffs in the case ",0
"Her daughter attended elementary school in nearby Bluefield , but Deal kept her out of the Bible class ",0
"Even though the class was optional , Deal said there were n’t any alternative lessons or activities for those who opted out ",0
Her daughter was told to sit in the computer lab for that half - hour and read a book ,0
Bypassing the class left her vulnerable to bullying ,1
Deal said other students told her daughter that she was going to hell ,1
"One day a student saw her daughter reading a “ Harry Potter ” novel and told her , according to the mother : “ You do n’t need to be reading this ",1
You need to be reading the Bible ,1
” ,1
Eventually Deal moved her daughter to a public school a few miles away in Virginia where there is no Bible class ,0
"She pays an out - of - state fee of several hundred dollars , but she no longer worries about her child being taunted ",0
Deal said she joined the suit because she believes strongly in the separation of church and state ,1
"“ When something is wrong , ” she said , “ you have to stand up against it ",0
” ,0
"God is a big deal in Mercer County , home to about 125 churches that dominate the main streets of its biggest towns , Princeton ( population 6,400 ) and Bluefield ( 10,400 ) , and smaller burgs such as Athens ( 1,000 ) , Bramwell ( 360 ) and Oakvale ( 120 ) ",0
"A lot of the good jobs in the county have left — 22 percent of its 61,000 residents live below the poverty level — but the churches have stayed ",0
You can find the Church of God here ,0
And the Church of Christ ,0
And the Church of Jesus ,0
"There are a couple of Catholic churches , a synagogue and a mosque , but the vast majority of houses of worship are Baptist , Methodist or Pentecostal ",0
"The radio in the region is filled with gospel stations , Bible talk shows and Christian rock ",0
Billboards tout the Ten Commandments or offer stern messages on abortion and eternal salvation ,0
"Beneath a Chick - fil - A billboard in Princeton , another asks : “ If you die tonight ",1
Heaven or Hell ? ” ,1
The Rev. ,0
Ray Hurt has been the lead pastor at the Church of God in Princeton for more than two decades ,0
"The church , one of the largest buildings in town , can hold up to 2,000 people for Sunday services and often does ",0
"For Hurt , Bible in the Schools , which has been in the public schools here in one form or another since 1939 , is simply a way for students to further their knowledge ",0
"“ There is a great deal of not just poetry and prose in the Bible , but from what I ’ve read almost every piece of history that ’s in the Bible has eventually been proven , ” he said ",0
“ We see the Bible not just as a book of faith but as a pretty accurate account of history that informs us about a lot of things that happened ,0
” ,0
"Hurt , whose son , the Rev. ",0
"J.B. Hurt , is also a minister in the Church of God and a member of the county school board , says he would oppose the program if he thought it was being used to teach religion or if students were required to take the class ",0
But he also embraces the idea that the Bible offers irrefutable lessons in morality and teaches the difference between right and wrong ,0
"“ If you read the Bible , you ’re going to get a whole lot of good ideas that are going to stick with you and make you a better person , ” he said ",0
“ You do n’t have to push religion with it ,0
It speaks for itself in terms of morals and ethics and those things ,0
” ,0
"The idea that a weekly Bible class for 6,600 students in 16 public elementary schools and three middle schools is somehow simply an academic offering does n’t sit well with Lynne White , 54 , a former two - term school board member and mother of two sons who went through Mercer schools ",0
"“ As a person of faith myself , I do n’t see any problem with having an after - school Bible program , ” White said ",0
“ But to me this seems a pretty clear violation of the Constitution ,1
” ,0
White holds the school board and leadership responsible for spreading what she says is a false sense of what the Bible in the Schools program is and does ,0
"In a commentary for the Charleston Gazette - Mail , White wrote that “ the Bible in the schools program in Mercer County is being sustained on a foundation of lies ",1
” ,0
"She argued that the classes are character education based on biblical values , that they were not electives because West Virginia does n’t offer electives in elementary or middle school and that even though the classes are funded by private donations , that does n’t mean they should be taught during the instructional day ",0
She also said it was untrue that children who did n’t take the class were n’t made to “ feel different or ostracized ,0
” ,0
"When White posted the article on Facebook , she heard from some supporters , but many others questioned her faith ",0
“ I will pray for you and all non - believers Lynne White ,0
God Bless ! ,0
! ” one wrote ,0
Another wrote : ,0
"“ Lynne White You are not a Christian , a Christian is a person who strives to be more Christ like with everything they do and I do not believe Christ would be working to shut this program down or alter it to include your worldly views ",1
” ,0
"If it were simply a popularity contest , Bible in the Schools would be allowed to continue as is ",0
Even the president of the local mosque in Princeton says it should stay ,0
"“ It ’s good to be God - fearing no matter how you approach it , ” said Mohammad Iqbal , head of the Islamic Society of the Appalachian Region ",0
"“ Whether it ’s the Bible , whether it ’s Koran , whether it ’s Torah , whether it ’s some other book ",0
"But it should be optional , not enforced ",0
"If the parents have no objection and the student has no objection , it is okay ",0
” ,0
But the program ’s fate will not be resolved by popular vote or on Facebook posts ,0
"Instead , the question will be tried in the courtroom of Judge David A. Faber of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia in Bluefield ",0
( Faber was nominated by President George H.W. ,1
Bush ,1
) ,1
"Representing the Mercer school district is the First Liberty Institute , a nonprofit law firm based in Texas that specializes in religious freedom cases ",0
"Hiram Sasser , a lawyer at the firm , said the district ’s main objective is to allow the Bible course to remain as an elective while making sure it complies with the law ",0
The district filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit on Wednesday ,0
"“ There are two things to look at , ” Sasser said ",0
“ The first is whether you can have a Bible course at all ,0
And the other is whether you can have the Bible course as it is presently constituted ,0
It ’s fair to say that we ’re very confident on the first issue ,0
And on the second issue ,0
"our client is very , very flexible in terms of making sure that the content is in compliance with the law ",1
” ,0
But the plaintiffs are n’t looking for flexibility ,0
They want the Bible class out of the school day ,0
"The program “ is unconstitutional at its core and can not be saved via modifications , ” said Patrick Elliott , a lawyer with the Freedom From Religion Foundation ",0
“ There is no legally permissible way for Mercer County Schools to continue with any type of program like this ,0
” ,0
"According to Elliott , the Mercer program is “ extremely rare ” and there are only a handful of districts around the country with similar courses ",1
"The amended complaint , Elliott said , seeks to prevent the school system from “ organizing , administering , or otherwise endorsing Bible classes for Mercer County Schools’ students in grades kindergarten through eighth grade ",0
” ,0
"Charles C. Haynes , the founding director of the Religious Freedom Center at the Newseum in Washington , does n’t foresee the program surviving a court challenge in its current form ",0
"“ This is a loser for the school district , ” Haynes said ",0
“ It ’s difficult to satisfy the First Amendment in elementary school when it comes to the Bible ,0
Students at that age really are n’t prepared to tell the difference between what is history and what is religious conviction ,0
” ,0
Haynes argues that people of faith are doing their religion a disservice when they try to have it taught by a government entity ,0
"They would rightly object , he said , if they lived somewhere where they were the religious minority and supporters of another religion wanted a course on their faith taught in public schools ",0
"“ Even if 99.9 percent of the people in the community want it , they need to remember that liberty of conscience is not up for a vote , ” he said ",1
Trenton Tolliver is oblivious to the Bible battle that swirls around him ,0
His first - grade school year ends next month ,0
Hanging in the balance of the court case is what he will learn in the Bible course in second grade ,0
Or if there will be a Bible course at all ,0
Jewish and Pro - Israel Students Kicked Off University Board for Opposing BDS ,1
First they came for the Jews ,1
And then they came for everyone else ,1
Jewish students have already faced plenty of harassment and hate at McGill ,0
The latest incident at the Canadian university comes with a rather blatant agenda ,1
A Jewish student at McGill University has been kicked off the student government board for having “ conflicts of interest ” due to his pro - Israel activism ,1
Third - year student Noah Lew was one of 12 board members up for general assembly ratification on Monday evening following his victory as vice - president finance of the Arts Undergraduate Society ,0
"The ratification vote is typically a mere formality , but Monday ’s was different due to Democratize Student Society of McGill University ( SSMU ) , an organization that was established to resist the university ’s ban of the Boycott , Divestment and Sanctions ( BDS ) movement on campus ",0
Democratize SSMU was able to pass a motion that required each board member to be voted upon separately under the grounds that they were n’t a fan of the names ,0
"When it was Lew ’s turn , he was voted down , 105 to 73 with 12 abstaining , with applause following the vote ",0
"Two other students who had criticized BDS , Alexander Scheffel and Josephine Wright O’Manique , were also voted down ",0
"Democratize SSMU had targeted Lew and the other two students on the board because they had connections to the Canadian Jewish Political Affairs Committee ( CJPAC ) and were involved in getting the BDS ban passed , which Democratize SSMU claimed were “ conflicts of interests ",0
” ,0
Somehow I do n't think being a member of a Muslim student group and supporting BDS would be considered a conflict of interest ,0
But the campus anti - Israel crowd has been working rather hard to intimidate and penalize anyone involved in pro - Israel organizations ,1
And to keep their racist boycott movement going by maintaining control over student governments ,1
Lew shared the experience on Facebook ,0
"“ I have no doubt from the information circulated about me and campaign run against me prior to this vote that this was about my Jewish identity , and nothing more , ” wrote Lew ",1
"“ I was blocked from being able to participate in my student government because I am Jewish , because I have been affiliated with Jewish organizations , and because I believe in the right to Jewish self - determination ",0
” Lew added that the experience shows the inherent anti - Semitism in the BDS movement ,0
"“ If BDS is not anti - Semitic , why did a BDS - led campaign name and shame me for my affiliation with a Jewish organization , and call on students to remove me from student government for this reason ? ” wrote Lew ",1
"“ If BDS is not anti - Semitic , why was I barred from participating in student government because of my Jewish identity ? ” ",1
There are some more details here and a petition ,0
"On Monday night , three students were removed from the Board of Directors of the Students’ Society of McGill University ( SSMU ) , McGill ’s main student government ",0
All three were targeted for removal either because they are Jewish or have vocally opposed anti - Jewish discrimination on campus ,0
"This episode is utterly unacceptable , and is merely the latest in a long string of antisemitic incidents at your university ",1
"Indeed , according to eyewitnesses , one of the members of the mob that removed the three directors was Igor Sadikov ",0
You will remember Sadikov as the student politician who in February told his followers to “ punch a Zionist today ,1
” It is unclear whether Sadikov has faced any disciplinary action for this incitement to violence from your administration ,0
Antisemitism at McGill does not emerge from a vacuum ,0
"Rather , it has been nurtured in part by a toxic campus press , especially the McGill Daily , a publication which openly refuses to publish any “ Zionist ” content ",1
"In practice , this prevents McGill ’s Jewish community from defending itself against the absurd attacks to which it is subjected ",1
"If the Daily is committed to systematically excluding the voices of an ethno - religious community on campus , then it can not continue to receive automatic student funding , as it does now ",0
The double standard here is pretty clear ,0
And we know exactly what the reaction would be if a student paper refused to publish any pro - Islamist content ,1
Has Trump Opened the Door ? ,1
"Sagacious gun owners have always known that the ultimate goal of gun control extremists such as Chuck Schumer , Nancy Pelosi , Dianne Feinstein , et al ",1
", has always been gun confiscation ",0
The plan is not to “ control ” the private ownership of firearms ; it is to PROHIBIT the private ownership of firearms ,0
Enacting ever - encroaching gun control laws is simply an incremental means to the ultimate end of gun confiscation and prohibition ,1
Donald Trump was elected on the promise of protecting the Second Amendment ( among other things ) ,0
"Instead , he has become the poster boy for one of the most egregious gun control machinations of all : gun confiscation ",1
"As I reported in this column last week , in a bipartisan meeting with congressmen and senators recently , President Trump “ voiced support for confiscating guns from certain individuals deemed to be dangerous , even if it violates due process rights ",0
"“ ‘ I like taking the guns early , like in this crazy man ’s case that just took place in Florida … to go to court would have taken a long time,’ Trump said at a meeting with lawmakers on school safety and gun violence ",0
"“ ‘ Take the guns first , go through due process second,’ Trump said ",1
“ Trump was responding to comments from Vice President Pence that families and local law enforcement should have more tools to report potentially dangerous individuals with weapons ,0
"“ ‘ Allow due process so no one ’s rights are trampled , but the ability to go to court , obtain an order and then collect not only the firearms but any weapons,’ Pence said ",1
"“ ‘ Or , Mike , take the firearms first , and then go to court,’ Trump responded ",0
” ,0
See the column here : ,0
Florida School Massacre Proves Police Are Worthless In Protecting Us ,0
"Well , Trump ’s statements are now the rallying cry for gun grabbers all over America to enact gun confiscation laws ",1
"So far , five states have passed “ red flag ” laws that allow police agencies to confiscate guns from someone deemed to be “ dangerous ” by either a law enforcement officer or a family member BEFORE the individual has committed any crime , and in one State ( Rhode Island ) the governor issued an executive order implementing a “ red flag ” law ",0
Here are the six states where the legislatures have already passed — or the governor has already issued an executive order implementing—“red flag ” laws : ,0
California ,0
Connecticut ,0
Indiana ,0
Oregon ,0
Washington ,0
Rhode Island ,0
"And since Trump ’s Stalinist statements , there are at least 24 additional states that are currently considering passing “ red flag ” laws ",1
These are : ,0
Alabama ,0
Alaska ,0
Arizona ,0
Delaware ,0
Florida ,0
Hawaii ,0
Illinois ,0
Iowa ,0
Kansas ,0
Kentucky ,0
Maryland ,0
Massachusetts ,0
Michigan ,0
Minnesota ,0
Missouri ,0
New Jersey ,0
New York ,0
North Carolina ,0
Ohio ,0
Pennsylvania ,0
Tennessee ,0
Utah ,0
Vermont ,0
Virginia ,0
And it ’s not taking long for law enforcement agencies in the above states to begin their Naziesque assault on gun owners ,0
"This report is from Seattle : Doubtless , many other states are also considering passing “ red flag ” laws ",0
“ The city ’s police department became the first law enforcement agency in the state to force the surrender of a firearm under a new law known as an ‘ extreme risk protection order.’ ,0
"“ The incident involves a man who lives in Belltown , who neighbors said had been intimidating people for the past year – even staring - down customers through store - front windows with a gun holstered at his side ",0
"“ Mental illness is suspected , but that new law allowed police to legally disarm him ",0
” ,0
"“ The man , who we are not naming , is also well known to the bars and restaurants below his unit along Second Ave ",0
The volume of complaints convinced Seattle police to seek an extreme risk protection order – or ‘ erpo’ – which allows law enforcement to legally remove guns from people deemed a danger to themselves or others ,0
"“ In this case , the man refused to comply ",0
"Because of the new law , police were then able to return with a warrant and force the man to surrender the firearm ",0
” ,0
"“ A few dozen erpos have been served and executed around the state , but Seattle police said they are the only agency so far to seize a gun because the owner refused to hand it over ",0
"“ Law enforcement professionals said these specialized protection orders could be a common sense strategy to try and prevent mass shootings – such as what happened in Parkland , Florida ",0
“ ‘ There ’s certainly a big concern of the connection between mental health and people exhibiting violent behavior and whether or not they should have access to firearms ,0
"The “ erpos ” give us that tool now as an option,’ said Sgt ",0
"Eric Pisconski , who leads the crisis response unit for the Seattle Police Department ",0
"“ The confiscations only last a year , although they can be renewed ",0
” ,0
See the report here : ,0
Seattle Police First In State To Seize Gun Under Mental Health Law ,0
A few observations are in order here : ,0
"First , the open carry of a firearm is LEGAL in the area where this took place ",1
"So , the fellow was violating NO gun laws whatsoever ",1
"Plus , he never removed the pistol from its holster or brandished it in any way ",0
"Secondly , the man was “ known ” to nearby bars and restaurants near his place of residence ",0
That means nothing ,0
Known for what ? ,0
The report does n’t even say the man was known for acting weirdly or strangely ,0
It just says he was “ known ,0
"” And even if he did act weirdly or strangely , if we denied constitutional rights to everyone in that category , a majority of Americans would have no rights , and ALL of Congress would have no rights ",1
"Thirdly , what does “ volume of complaints ” mean ? ",1
How many complaints were received over a YEAR ’S time ? ,1
Two ? ,1
Five ? ,1
Ten ? ,1
People complaining about other people happens all of the time ,1
"Plus , if complaints had been received over the course of an entire year and police just now decided to act , the man must not have been considered much of a threat ",0
"Fourthly , there was NO report of the man “ exhibiting violent behavior , ” as the police sergeant claims ",1
The report says “ he had been intimidating people ,0
” How ? ,0
No specifics except to say he was “ staring ” at people ,0
Wow ! ,1
Run for your lives ! ,1
"Fifthly , a U.S. citizen who has committed NO CRIME is denied his Natural right of self - defense for a whole year ",1
"And the media report says the confiscations “ only ” last a year , with the caveat that they may be extended ",1
Indeed ,1
They could and very likely will be extended indefinitely ,1
"How many defenseless ( unarmed ) people are robbed , assaulted , accosted , beaten up , raped , wounded , paralyzed , or killed in a year ’s time ? ",1
It seems many politicians ( and many police officers themselves ) will not be content until every American citizen is totally defenseless and unable to protect him or herself ,0
"I tell you this with all seriousness : At some point , the American people will be forced to view these governmental attacks against our Second Amendment liberties as a declaration of war ",1
"Sixthly , the man quoted in the news story who had complained about the armed fellow did so because he said he did n’t like the sight of the man carrying a firearm , as it made him “ afraid ",0
” ,0
SO WHAT ? ,1
That the mere sight of a law - abiding citizen openly carrying a sidearm would make someone “ afraid ” is not sufficient reason to deny the citizen his constitutional right to keep and “ bear ” arms ,0
"This “ I ’m offended ” or “ his gun scares me ” complaint is nothing but cover for little Nazis to try and deny another person their Natural , God - given liberty ",1
"But under this new “ red flag ” law in Washington State , police are now able to confiscate a person ’s firearm without the person committing ANY crime — or even threatening to commit a crime ",1
"Even when police forced the man to surrender his firearm , the man made no threatening gesture toward the officers ",0
Gun confiscation has started in America — and President Trump ’s Stalinist statements about taking guns first and worrying about due process later is the banner under which this is happening ,1
"When Trump promised to add “ mental health ” regulations to gun purchases and ownership , he opened Pandora ’s Box ",1
I go into the “ mental health ” trap in more detail in this column : ,0
Trump Set To Enact More Gun Control ,0
"“ Mental health ” regulations for gun ownership is what extremist gun grabbers Schumer , Pelosi , Feinstein , et al ",0
", have been trying to accomplish for decades ",0
"Now , it is the “ pro - gun ” Republican President Donald Trump who is the one making it happen ",0
Kris Kobach is the Secretary of State of Kansas ,0
He is a former professor of constitutional law at UMKC Law School ,0
He wrote an excellent analysis of the constitutional violations of these “ red flag ” laws : ,0
The seizure of guns without any hearing at all ,0
The laws all contain an “ ex parte ” provision that allows the state to temporarily seize a person ’s guns without even notifying the gun owner or giving him a chance to be heard ,0
This is the quintessential denial of due process ,0
The Fourth Amendment makes clear that a person can not be denied of liberty ( to exercise one ’s constitutional right to bear arms ) without due process of law ,0
"This confiscation is “ temporary , ” but it can easily lead to long - term or permanent confiscation ",0
Based on the testimony of one unrelated person ,0
The confiscation order can be based on the testimony of only one person claiming that the gun owner poses a risk to the safety of himself or others ,0
The law deceptively says that it has to be the testimony of a “ family member ,1
"” [ Most of the “ red flag ” laws , such as the one in Washington State , do not limit who can claim the gun owner poses a risk to the safety of himself or others to family members ",0
] ,0
But “ family member ” is defined to include “ former dating partners ” and anyone who has ever lived with the defendant ,0
"So a jilted former boyfriend or girlfriend , or even a roommate from years ago , could easily set in motion the disarming of a lawful gun owner ",0
Using a very low standard of proof ,0
The standard for obtaining an ex parte order against a gun owner is absurdly low – one need only show “ reasonable cause ” to believe that the person may pose a risk ,1
That ’s even lower than the “ probable cause ” standard for obtaining a search warrant ,0
"In addition , the judge is forced to rush his decision and issue the confiscation order on the same day of the ex parte hearing ",0
"Within two weeks of the ex parte hearing , a hearing with the gun owner present must occur ; the purpose is to put in place a long - term confiscation order ",0
"But even at that hearing , the standard of proof is far below the “ beyond a reasonable doubt ” standard used in criminal trials ",0
"Rather , it need only be shown by “ a preponderance of evidence ” that the person poses a risk of injury to self or others ",0
What kind of evidence ? ,0
Things like the “ reckless storage ” of firearms and drinking habits can be considered ,0
"If you keep a handgun in the bedside table and drink beer regularly , you may [ be ] in trouble ",1
Shifting the burden of proof to the gun owner ,0
"The long - term confiscation order lasts up to a year , but may be renewed indefinitely ",0
"Once it is in place , it becomes very difficult to remove ",0
"To have the confiscation order lifted , the gun owner must provehe does not pose a threat to himself or others ",0
Proving a negative is nearly impossible ,1
"Adding insult to injury , the bill even authorizes local law enforcement to charge the gun owner a storage fee for confiscating and storing his guns ",1
"After the Parkland school shooting , had Donald Trump simply used his bully pulpit to promote arming teachers and school employees as a deterrent and defense against these school shootings without calling for more gun control , it would have been a HUGE boost for the Second Amendment in general and school safety in particular ",1
"Instead , Trump fell in with anti - Second Amendment liberals and started calling for more gun control , adding “ mental health ” restrictions to gun purchases and making his stupid Stalinist statements about taking guns first and worrying about due process later ",1
"As a result , anti - gun liberals all over the country are using Trump ’s own words and proposed gun control policies as a rallying cry to enact gun confiscation laws ",1
"As it stands right now , Donald Trump has opened the door for more damage being done to the Second Amendment than any other president , Democrat or Republican , in our lifetime ",1
"Freedomists in the 50 states had better keep a close eye on their State legislatures this year and next , because , thanks to Donald Trump , gun confiscation is going to be on the agenda in virtually every single State in the country ",0
"And while you are at it , do n’t overlook the federal Congress ",0
No wonder Dianne Feinstein looked so deliriously ( and devilishly ) happy when Trump uttered his stupid comment about gun confiscation and said he wanted to bring an assault weapons ban ( Feinstein ’s bill ) into proposed gun control legislation ,1

"But if you are a freedom - loving American who values your liberties and the God - given right to defend them , happy is NOT what you should be feeling right now ",1
"You should be OUTRAGED at Donald Trump , and you should be absolutely determined to be ever vigilant against ANY attempt from Democrats or Republicans from federal , State , or municipal government to enact further restrictions against your right to keep and bear arms — because Trump has opened the door not only for more gun control but also for gun confiscation ",1
P.S. ,0
One more time I want to remind readers that self - defense — including defense against tyrannical government — is more than a right guaranteed in the Second Amendment to our Constitution ; it is a duty assigned us in Nature by our Creator ,0
"For anyone , especially a Christian , to willingly surrender their means of self - defense is not only a crime against liberty ; it is a sin against God ",0
I urge my Christian friends ( and anyone else ) to read the book my constitutional attorney son and I wrote entitled “ To Keep or Not To Keep : Why Christians Should Not Give Up Their Guns ,0
” ,0
"Mark it down : Any law demanding the citizenry to surrender their AR-15 rifles would be unconstitutional , unnatural , and unbiblical ",0
And NO Christian or other free man should ever comply with such a law ,1
I know that there is a plethora of pastors who teach that Christians ought to obey the government should it outlaw our guns ,0
THEY ARE WRONG ,0
"They are wrong biblically , constitutionally , and morally ",1
Our book shows the Natural and Biblical duty of self - defense ,0
I do n’t know of another book like it ,0
"With all that is happening today , it is CRUCIAL that people ( especially Christians ) become familiar with the truths contained in this book ",1
I urge you to order one for yourself and one ( at least ) for your friends and kinfolk ,0

There Were “ Active Shooters On The Runway ” Bombshell Air Traffic Control Audio From The Night Of The Las Vegas Massacre Reveals ,0
"In yet another striking example of a widespread cover - up currently underway regarding the worst mass shooting in American history , new air traffic control audio has been released that details the fact that there were multiple active shooters on the airports property which is extremely close to the venue where at least part of the attack took place ",1
"The audio recordings , taken from the night of the October 1st massacre that left 58 dead and over 500 injured , are further proof that multiple shooters were used throughout the area , a fact that directly contradicts the official story ",0
"During the air traffic control recordings , which were released by political strategist and co - founder of “ The New Right ” Mike Tokes , one of the dispatchers is heard telling an incoming plane that landing might not be a good idea because there were multiple active shooters on the airport property itself ",0
"“ Shutting down might not be a good idea , there ’s active shooters on the runway , ” he declared ",0
"“ The 19s are closed , we are in the process of trying to round them up , they are on the airport property ",0

"They ’re on the airport property ” pic.twitter.com/HZf3LBeAgk — Mike Tokes ( @MikeTokes ) October 29 , 2017 ",0
This stunning tower audio once again provides proof that the entire narrative that claims that Stephen Paddock operated alone from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel is complete nonsense and that authorities are actually actively covering up what really happened on that fateful night ,1
"While there have been countless stories since the attack that raise the very real possibility that this was a false flag , one has stood out due to the fact that the person who released the information died shortly after ",0
"As Shepard Ambellas reported in a now viral article , “ Kymberley Suchomel , who posted her eyewitness account of the Las Vegas massacre in astonishingly vivid detail to her Facebook page on Oct. 4 , subsequently passed away in her home on Oct. 9 from what reports are claiming are natural causes ",0
” ,0
"“ Shockingly , just days before her death , Suchomel posted key details about the shooting to Facebook that contradicted the official narrative which claims that Stephen Paddock was the lone gunman ",0
” ,0
"From dozens of eyewitness reports , including Suchomel ’s , that clearly indicate the presence of multiple shooters , to the possibility of helicopters being used in the attack , the American people are clearly not being told the truth ",1
It is also important to keep in mind that multiple investigative reports conducted by other alternative media outlets have actually named government officials and private companies that may be behind the attack and so far there has been no official denial from either ,0
"Apparently , They Think We are Fools ",1
As Pope Francis continues his five - year - long tirade against the imaginary Catholic Pharisees who defend the Church ’s teaching on the indissolubility of marriage and the integrally related Eucharistic discipline — he is still at it as of yesterday ( January 9)—he and his collaborators are busily engineering neo - Pharisaical escape hatches from the negative precepts of the divine and natural law emanating from the Sixth Commandment ,1
"Determined to quell any Catholic opposition to his moral subversion , Francis has slapped the label Authentic Magisterium ® on his outrageous opinion that in “ complex circumstances ” wherein it is not “ feasible ” to live as brother and sister , two people who are not married can be admitted to Holy Communion without ceasing extra - marital sexual relations so long as they engage in an ill - defined “ process of discernment ",0
"” As Father Brian Harrison has so trenchantly observed , this means that people embroiled in adultery can receive Holy Communion while they “ discern ” that they should not be receiving Holy Communion because they are embroiled in adultery ",0
Do they think we are fools ? ,1
Then there is the endlessly double - talking Cardinal Müller ,0
"In a recent interview concerning Rocco Buttiglione ’s verbal contortions aimed at demonstrating that the administration of Holy Communion to public adulterers is consistent with the Church ’s bimillenial prohibition of precisely that , Müller proposed this preposterous “ solution ” to a “ problem ” that does not exist : ",1
"It is possible that the penitent may be convinced in conscience , and with good reasons , of the invalidity of the first marriage even though they can not offer canonical proof ",0
"In this case the marriage valid before God would be the second one and the pastor could grant the sacrament , certainly with the appropriate precautions as not to scandalize the community of the faithful and not to weaken the conviction of marriage indissolubility ",0
The Cardinal knows this is moral and canonical nonsense ,1
"No Catholic , whether or not he consults a priest , can declare for himself that his marriage in the Church was invalid , especially when — indeed because — he lacks canonical proof of invalidity ",1
"Moreover , absent an annulment granted by the competent Church tribunal , a purported “ second marriage ” can only be an invalid civil ceremony and thus a thinly disguised form of continuous public adultery ",0
"Cardinal Burke , whom Francis sacked as head of the Church ’s highest tribunal because he was a major impediment to the conspiracy culminating in Amoris Laetitia ( AL ) , has observed the obvious in this regard : ",1
Such cases do not exist ,0
No priest has the authority to declare a marriage null in the internal forum ,0
"Marriage is a public state in the Church , and the judgment regarding an accusation of nullity of marriage must be made in accord with the long practice of the Church ",0
"If a college of judges in a matrimonial tribunal is not able to arrive at moral certitude regarding the nullity of a marriage after a careful and thorough examination of the petition of nullity , how can an individual priest be capable of making such a judgment having to do with the eternal salvation of the soul in question ? ",1
"The only case in which a priest could admit a person living in an irregular matrimonial union to receive the Sacraments of Penance and Holy Eucharist is the case of a couple who agree to live “ as brother and sister ” , that is to respect the marriage to which they are bound by not living in a marital way with another person ",0
"Even then , the priest would have to insist that the couple living in continence receive the Sacraments in a place in which they are not well known , lest other faithful be led to believe that persons living in an irregular matrimonial union may receive the Sacraments ",0
Does Cardinal Müller think we are fools ? ,0
"Some of us apparently are , or at least are willing to serve as knowing dupes by defending neo - Pharisaical sophistry that would produce “ a discipline alien to the entire Tradition of the Catholic and Apostolic faith ",0
” ,0
"Apparently , they think they can fool us in the next phase of the program of moral subversion that this incredible Pope seriously expects us to believe is an imperative of “ mercy ” : the justification of contraception in “ complex cases ” to which “ discernment ” must be applied ",1
"Consider the recent declaration by one of Francis ’s new appointments to the Pontifical Academy for Life , whose entire membership he sacked and whose constitution he ordered rewritten to neutralize it ",0
"In a lecture at the Gregorian , one Father Maurizio Chiodi , a “ moral theologian ” of the post - Vatican II variety , proposed that “ an artificial method for the regulation of births could be recognized as anact of responsibilitythat is carried out , not in order to radically reject the gift of a child , but because in those situationsresponsibility calls the couple and the family to other forms of welcome and hospitality ",0
” ,0
"That is , Francis ’s man at the reconstituted Pontifical Academy declares openly that there is a duty to contracept ! ",0
"Chiodi ’s sole “ authority ” for this lie from the pit of hell is nothing more than Chapter 8 of AL , the only document of its kind in the entire history of the Church ",1
"AL will doubtless be providing cover for a whole new line of Authentic Magisterium ® products , all of which will be utter fakes , including some form of “ pastoral integration ” of homosexual unions ",1
"Evidently , they do think we are fools or willing to play the fool in exchange for the benefits of respectable conformity in the midst of an unparalleled debacle for the Church ",1
"( Consider the example of Catholic Answers , which “ defends the Faith ” while refusing to recognize that it is under ferocious attack from the very vertices of the Church ",0
Silence at best is the price it must pay for remaining in good standing with the pro - homosexual bishop Francis has installed in San Diego ,1
) ,1
But we are not fools ,1
And God will not be mocked ,1
Francis and all his designs will ultimately come to nothing ,1
"Meanwhile , ours is but to keep the Faith and protest before God and man the blows now raining down against the Church , even when they come from a wayward Roman Pontiff at her summit ",0
"Indeed , especially then ",0
Another Sound Weapon Used To ATTACK US Diplomats : This Time In China ,0
"A United States government employee assigned to the American consulate in Guangzhou , China suffered a mild traumatic brain injury similar to those reported by diplomats in Cuba ",0
"The unnamed worker reported , “ subtle and vague , but abnormal , sensations of sound and pressure ",0
” ,0
"The government employee experienced the symptoms from late 2017 until April of 2018 , according to the U.S. State Department ",0
“ The employee was sent to the United States for further evaluation ,0
"On May 18 , 2018 , the Embassy learned that the clinical findings of this evaluation matched mild traumatic brain injury ( MTBI ) , ” Jinnie Lee , U.S. Embassy spokesperson in Beijing , told Gizmodo by email ",0
"“ The Chinese government has assured us they are also investigating and taking appropriate measures , ” Lee continued ",0
But this is n’t the first time a sound weapon has been used on American diplomats ,0
Cuba has been accused of using a similar device to cause brain trauma in Americans at the embassy in Havana ,0
It all started in the fall of 2016 ,0
"Several of the affected diplomats were recent arrivals at the embassy , which reopened in 2015 as part of Barack Obama ’s reestablishment of diplomatic relations with Cuba ",0
"The Daily Mail reported that one diplomat described being jolted awake in a Havana hotel room by a grinding , blaring cacophony ",0
"When he moved a few feet across the room , the noise stopped ",0
"When he got back into bed , the agonizing sound hit him again ; as if , he told doctors , he had walked through some invisible wall cutting straight down the middle of his room ",1
"Whether they heard anything or not , the consequences have been unmistakable — symptoms ranging from nosebleeds , nausea , dizziness and severe headaches to mild brain damage and permanent hearing or memory loss ",0
"Oddly , as soon as some of the victims left Cuba , they stopped hearing noises ",0
–SHTFPlan ,0
The mysterious illnesses reported by U.S. government employees in Cuba are allegedly thought to be either a “ sonic attack ” or perhaps malfunctioning surveillance gear ,0
"It ’s not known yet whether the injured government worker in China was targeted with any such device , despite reporting similar symptoms as the diplomats in Cuba ",0
"The U.S. Consulate in Guangzhou says that it has n’t had any other reported cases of strange sounds being heard by American officials , but is taking the issue seriously ",0
"“ If you have concerns about any symptoms or medical problems that developed during or after a stay in China , consult a medical professional , ” the State Department said in a public release ",0
"“ While in China , if you experience any unusual acute auditory or sensory phenomena accompanied by unusual sounds or piercing noises , do not attempt to locate their source ",0
"Instead , move to a location where the sounds are not present , ” the release said ",0
"The Cuban government continues to deny they attacked U.S. diplomats with a sonic weapon , and very little additional information is known about those who suffered through the strange ordeal ",0
"After months of investigations , U.S. officials concluded that the diplomats had been exposed to an advanced device that operated outside the range of audible sound and had been deployed either inside or outside their residences ",0
"It was not immediately clear if the device was a weapon used in a deliberate attack , or had some other purpose ",0
This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Ca n't Be Trusted ,1

This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Ca n't Be Trusted ,1
In 2015 the British Guardian appointed Katherine Viner as editor in chief ,0
Under her lead the paper took a new direction ,0
"While it earlier made attempts to balance its shoddier side with some interesting reporting , it is now solidly main stream in the worst sense ",1
It promotes neo - liberalism and a delves into cranky identity grievances stories ,1
It also became an main outlet for manipulative propaganda peddled by the British secret services ,1
"Its recent fake news story about Paul Manafort , Wikileaks and Julian Assange aptly demonstrates this ",1
The documentation of it is a bit lengthy but provides that it was a willful fake ,1
"On November 27 the Guardian prepared to publish a story which asserted that Paula Manafort , Trump 's former campaign manager , had met Julian Assange , the publisher of Wikileaks , in the Ecuadorian embassy in London on at least three occasions ",0
Some two hours before the story went public it contacted Manafort and Assange 's lawyers to get their comments ,0
Assange 's Wikileaks responded through its public Twitter account which has 5.4 million followers ,0
On of those followers is Katherine Viner : ,0
"WikiLeaks @wikileaks - 13:06 utc - 27 Nov 2018 SCOOP : In letter today to Assange 's lawyers , Guardian 's Luke Harding , winner of Private Eye 's Plagiarist of the Year , falsely claims jailed former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort had secret meetings with Assange in 2013 , 2015 and 2016 in story Guardian are """""""" planning to run """""""" ",1
It attached the email the Guardian 's Luke Harding had send ,0
90 minutes later the Guardian piece went life ,0
It led the front page and also appeared in print ,0
The first version read : ,0
"Manafort held secret talks with Assange in Ecuadorian embassy Donald Trump ’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort held secret talks with Julian Assange inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London , and visited around the time he joined Trump ’s campaign , the Guardian has been told ",0
"Sources have said Manafort went to see Assange in 2013 , 2015 and in spring 2016 – during the period when he was made a key figure in Trump ’s push for the White House ",0
It is unclear why Manafort wanted to see Assange and what was discussed ,0
"But the last meeting is likely to come under scrutiny and could interest Robert Mueller , the special prosecutor who is investigating alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia ",0
A well - placed source has told the Guardian that Manafort went to see Assange around March 2016 ,0
Months later WikiLeaks released a stash of Democratic emails stolen by Russian intelligence officers ,0
"Manafort , 69 , denies involvement in the hack and says the claim is “ 100 % false ” ",1
His lawyers declined to answer the Guardian ’s questions about the visits ,0
The piece did not include the public denial Wikileaks issued to its 5.4 million followers one and a half hour before it was published ,0
The Guardian piece came at a critical moment ,0
Currently the U.K. and Ecuador conspire to deliver Julian Assange to U.S. authorities ,0
"On Monday special counsel Robert Mueller said Manafort lied to investigators , violating his recent plea deal ",0
The new sensational claim was immediately picked up by prominent reporters and major main stream outlets ,1
They distributed is as a factual account ,0
It is likely that millions of people took note of its claim ,0
But several people who had followed the Russiagate fairytale and the Mueller investigation were immediately suspicious of the Guardian claim ,1
The story was weakly sourced and included some details that seemed unlikely to be true ,1
Glenn Greenwald noted that the Ecuadorian embassy is under heavy CCTV surveillance ,0
"There are several guards , and visitors have to provide their identity to enter it ",0
Every visit is logged ,0
"If Manafort had really visited Assange , it would have long been known : ",0
"In sum , the Guardian published a story today that it knew would explode into all sorts of viral benefits for the paper and its reporters even though there are gaping holes and highly sketchy aspects to the story ",1
"Moreover , the main author of the story , Luke Harding , is known to be a notorious fraud , a russo - phobe intelligence asset with a personal grievance towards Assange and Wikileaks ",1
A year ago an important Moon of Alabama piece - From Snowden To Russia - gate - The CIA And The Media - mentioned Harding : ,0
"The people who promote the """""""" Russian influence """""""" nonsense are political operatives or hacks ",1
"Take for example Luke Harding of the Guardian who just published a book titled Collusion : Secret Meetings , Dirty Money , and How Russia Helped Donald Trump Win ",1
He was taken apart in a Real News interview ( vid ) about the book ,1
The interviewer pointed out that there is absolutely no evidence in the book to support its claims ,1
"When asked for any proof for his assertion Harding defensively says that he is just """""""" storytelling """""""" - in other words : it is fiction ",1
Harding earlier wrote a book about Edward Snowden which was a similar sham ,1
"Julian Assange called it """""""" a hack job in the purest sense of the term """""""" ",1
Harding is also known as plagiarizer ,1
"When he worked in Moscow he copied stories and passages from the now defunct Exile , run by Matt Taibbi and Mark Ames ",1
The Guardian had to publish an apology ,1
The new Guardian story looked like another weak attempt to connect the alleged Russian malfeasance with Assange and the Wikileaks publishing of the DNC emails ,1
Assange and other involved people deny that such a relation existed ,1
There is no public evidence that support such claims ,1
Shortly after the Guardian 's fake news story went public Paul Manafort issued an unequivocal denial : ,0
"“ I have never met Julian Assange or anyone connected to him , ” the statement said ",0
"“ I have never been contacted by anyone connected to Wikileaks , either directly or indirectly ",0
I have never reached out to Assange or Wikileaks on any matter ,1
We are considering all legal options against the Guardian who proceeded with this story even after being notified by my representatives that it was false ,0
” ,0
At 16:05 utc the Guardian silently edited the story ,0
Caveats ( here in italic and underlined ) were added to the headline and within several paragraphs ,0
No editorial note was attached to inform the readers of the changes : ,0
"Manafort held secret talks with Assange in Ecuadorian embassy , sources say ... ",0
It is unclear why Manafort would have wanted to see Assange and what was discussed ,0
"But the last apparent meeting is likely to come under scrutiny and could interest Robert Mueller , the special prosecutor who is investigating alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia ",0
... ,0
Why Manafort might have sought out Assange in 2013 is unclear ,0
... ,0
"Manafort , 69 , denies involvement in the hack and says the claim is “ 100 % false ” ",1
His lawyers initially declined to answer the Guardian ’s questions about the visits ,0
One paragraph was added to included Wikileaks ' denial : ,0
In a series of tweets WikiLeaks said Assange and Manafort had not met ,0
Assange described the story as a hoax ,1
"At 16:30 utc , under fire from other media and journalists , the Guardian issued a statement : ",0
This story relied on a number of sources ,0
We put these allegations to both Paul Manafort and Julian Assange 's representatives prior to publication ,0
Neither responded to deny the visits taking place ,0
We have since updated the story to reflect their denials ,0
"This defensive Guardian claim is , like its story , evidently completely false ",1
Wikileaks publicly denied the Guardian 's claims 90 minutes before the story was first published ,1
Manafort asserts that his lawyers had notified the Guardian that the story was false before the Guardian ' proceeded with the story ' ,1
At 21:05 utc a third version was published which included Manafort 's denial ,0
Half an hour later Julian Assange instructed his lawyers to sue the Guardian for libel ,0
Wikileaks opened a fund to support the lawsuit ,0
"A day after the Guardian smear piece the Washington Times reported that Manafort 's passports , entered into evidence by the Mueller prosecution , show that he did not visit London in any of the years the Guardian claimed he was there to visit Assange ",1
The story was completely false and the Guardian knew it was ,1
It disregarded and left out the denials the subjects of the story had issued before it was published ,1
The Guardian has become a main outlet for British government disinformation operations aimed at defaming Russia ,1
It smeared Assange and Snowden as Russian collaborators ,1
It uncritically peddled the Russiagate story and the nonsensical Skripal claims which are both obviously concocted by British intelligence services ,1
That seems to have become its main purpose ,1
As Disobediant Media notes ( emphasis in the original ) : ,0
"While most readers with functional critical thinking capacity may readily dismiss the Guardian ’s smear on its face , the fact that the Guardian published this piece , and that Luke Harding is still operating with even the tiniest modicum of respect as a journalist despite his history of deceit , tells us something bone - chilling about journalism ",1
"It is no accident that Luke Harding is still employed : in fact , it is because of Harding ’s consistent loyalty to establishment , specifically the UK intelligence apparatus , over the truth that determines his “ success ” amongst legacy press outlets ",1
"Harding is not a defacement or a departure from the norm , but the personification of it ",1
"Jonathan Cook , a former Guardian writer , makes a similar point : ",0
"The truth is that the Guardian has not erred in this latest story attacking Assange , or in its much longer - running campaign to vilify him ",1
"With this story , it has done what it regularly does when supposedly vital western foreign policy interests are at stake – it simply regurgitates an elite - serving , western narrative ",1
"Its job is to shore up a consensus on the left for attacks on leading threats to the existing , neoliberal order : ... ",1
The Guardian did not make a mistake in vilifying Assange without a shred of evidence ,1
It did what it is designed to do ,1
We have previously shown that the Guardian even uses fascist propaganda tropes to smear the Russian people ,1
It is openly publishing Goebbels ' cartoons and rhetoric against Europes biggest state ,1
There is no longer any line that it does not dare to cross ,1
Unfortunately other ' western ' media are not much better ,1
Within hours of being published the Guardian piece was debunked as fake news ,0
That did not hinder other outlets to add to its smear ,1
"Politico allowed """""""" a former CIA officer , """""""" writing under a pen name , to suggest - without any evidence - that the Guardian has been duped - not by its MI5/6 and Ecuadorian spy sources , but by Russian disinformation : ",1
"Rather than being the bombshell smoking gun that directly connects the Trump campaign to WikiLeaks , perhaps the report is something else entirely : a disinformation campaign ",1
Is it possible someone planted this story as a means to discredit the journalists ? ,1
... ,0
Harding is likely a major target for anyone wrapped up in Russia ’s intelligence operation against the West ’s democratic institutions ,0
... ,0
"If this latest story about Manafort and Assange is false — that is , if , for example , the sources lied to Harding and Collyns ( or if the sources themselves were lied to and thus thought they were being truthful in their statements to the journalists ) , or if the Ecuadorian intelligence document is a fake , the most logical explanation is that it is an attempt to make Harding look bad ",0

"President Donald Trump on Tuesday issued presidential pardons to two Oregon cattle ranchers , Dwight and Steven Hammond , convicted in 2012 of committing arson on federal lands near their ranch ",0
The father and son 's 2016 imprisonment — and the armed protest at a national wildlife refuge that followed — formed a flashpoint in the ongoing dispute between cattle ranchers and the federal government over land - use rights ,0

"The concerns , which the department says can be tied to the Florida Democratic Party , center around date changes on forms used to fix vote - by - mail ballots sent with incorrect or missing information ",0
"Known as “ cure affidavits , ” those documents used to fix mail ballots were due no later than 5 p.m. on Nov. 5 — the day before the election ",0
"But affidavits released on Tuesday by the DOS show that documents from four different counties said the ballots could be returned by 5 p.m. on Thursday , which is not accurate ",0
"Audio of a Florida Democratic Party caller leaving a voicemail message asking a Palm Beach County voter to fix their vote by mail ballot after Election Day , which is not allowed , was also sent to POLITICO separately ",0
It was not part of the information turned over to federal prosecutors ,0
"Among the counties in question is Broward , which emerged as the epicenter of controversy as three statewide races and three local legislative races went into recounts following the Nov. 6 elections ",0
Republicans have pointed to embattled Broward Elections chief Brenda Snipes’ record of past election gaffes in arguing that the largely Democratic country is tilted against them — perhaps fraudulently so ,1
DOS officials have repeatedly told the media that the monitors they sent to Broward County saw no election fraud ,0
It was n’t until Tuesday that the office revealed publicly that it had turned over information to federal prosecutors ,0
"The information was sent on Nov. 9 by Bradley McVay , DOS’ interim general counsel , who asked that the altered dates be investigated ",1
"“ Altering a form in a manner that provides the incorrect date for a voter to cure a defect … imposes a burden on the voter significant enough to frustrate the voter ’s ability to vote , ” McVay wrote in a letter that was sent Nov. 9 and released publicly on Tuesday ",1
The letter was sent to U.S. ,0

Political parties can get daily lists of people who had their mail - in ballots rejected ,0
Political parties — or anyone else — can also get the publicly available cure affidavits and send them to voters who had a mail - in ballot rejected to encourage them to fix the ballots ,0
"In an email chain released as part of the Department of State ’s Tuesday document dump , Citrus County Supervisor of Elections Susan Gill last week told DOS officials that a voter who received one of the cure affidavits with the wrong date had also received a call from a number identified as the Tallahassee office of the Florida Democratic Party , an indication the party was reaching out about her vote by mail ballot ",0
"“ When I called it , it is the Democratic Party of Florida , ” she said in a Nov. 8 email to DOS officials ",0
She went on to write that she thinks the incorrect date was used because whoever sent the cure affidavit mixed up the deadline for cure affidavits with the deadline for provisional ballots ,0
"But , she said , “ a bigger problem is the fact they actually changed one of the DOE forms ",1

"An email chain among senior Google executives from the day after the 2016 presidential election reveals the company tried to influence the 2016 United States presidential election on behalf of one candidate , Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton ",0
"In the emails , a Google executive describes efforts to pay for free rides for a certain sect of the population to the polls – a get - out - the - vote for Hispanic voters operation – and how these efforts were because she thought it would help Hillary Clinton win the general election in 2016 ",1
She also used the term “ silent donation ” to describe Google ’s contribution to the effort to elect Clinton president ,1
"The main email , headlined , “ Election results and the Latino vote , ” was sent on Nov. 9 , 2016—the day after Clinton ’s loss to Trump in the 2016 presidential election — by Eliana Murillo , Google ’s Multicultural Marketing department head ",0
The four page email begins with Murillo claiming she and others at Google were engaged in non - partisan activities not designed to help any one candidate or another — only to undercut her own commentary in later passages in the emails by openly admitting the entire effort to boost Latino turnout using Google products with official company resources was to elect Clinton over Trump ,1
"The critical miscalculation , Murillo wrote in a stunning admission in the email , was that Latino voters backed Trump by higher margins than any experts had forecast in the lead - up to the election ",1
"Trump ’s 29 percent among Hispanics nationally blew prognosticators away , and he hit even higher numbers — about 31 percent — in the key battleground state of Florida , Murillo admitted ",1
Murillo wrote at the outset of the lengthy message : ,0
We worked very hard ,0
Many people did ,0
"We pushed tp get out the Latino vote with our features , our partners , and our voices ",0
We kept our Google efforts non - partisan and followed our company ’s protocols for the elections strategy ,1
"We emphasized our mission to give Latinos access to information so that they can make an informed decision at the polls , and we feel very grateful for all the support to do this important work ",0
"Latinos voted in record - breaking numbers , particularly with early votes ",1
A large percentage of Latino voters in Florida were new voters who had become citizens just in time to vote ,0
"We saw high traffic for the search queries ‘ votar,’ ‘ como votar,’ and ‘ donde voter,’ in key states like Florida and Nevada ",0
We will be pulling in more info in the coming hours / days but so far we definitely know there was high traffic on search in Spanish ,0
Without translating our tools the users would n’t have found the information they needed ,0
"Objectively speaking , our goal was met — we pushed and successfully launched the search features in Spanish , and we thank Lisa for her support in advocating for this work ",0
"I sent Philipp a note yesterday to thank him because he and others voiced their support for this too , and we greatly appreciate it ",0
"Even Sundar gave the effort a shout out and a comment in Spanish , which was really special ",0
"“ Sundar ” presumably refers to Google ’s chief executive officer Sundar Pichai , who took the reins of the massive search giant in October 2015 ",0
"“ Lisa ” presumably refers to Lisa Gevelber , the vice president of Global Marketing for Google — who forwarded Murillo ’s entire four - page email to several other Google executives in another chain also obtained by Breitbart News in which Gevelber praises Murillo ’s activities with official company resources as having made a “ great difference ",0
"” “ Philipp ” presumably refers to Philipp Schindler , a senior vice president and Google ’s chief business officer per his LinkedIn page ",0
The emails were first revealed on Fox News on Monday evening on Tucker Carlson Tonight by anchor Tucker Carlson in a special report ,0
"Breitbart News also obtained them , and has reached out to Google with a number of questions about the emails ",0
"Carlson , in his exclusive report on Fox News Monday night , compared the revelations in the Google emails to the probe of Russian interference in the U.S. election to Special Counsel Robert Mueller — raising the question about how much influence tech giants like Google and Facebook have on election outcomes in the United States ",0
"Carlson cited Dr. Robert Epstein , a social scientist and an expert on Google , who has said , in Carlson ’s words , “ Google alone could determine the outcome of almost any election just by altering its search selections and we would never know it ",1
” ,0
Epstein has published research detailing how Google could influence the results of U.S. elections ,0
"Breitbart News has exclusively published several of Epstein ’s reports , including a recent one showing that Google search manipulation can swing huge swaths of voters ",1
"In his report on Monday night , Carlson then described the emails he obtained , which Breitbart News also obtained ",0
Carlson said : ,0
This was n’t a get - out - the - vote effort or whatever they say ,1
It was n’t aimed at all potential voters ,0
It was n’t even aimed at a balanced cross - section of subgroups ,0
Google did n’t try to get out the vote among say Christian Arabs in Michigan or say Persian Jews in Los Angeles — they sometimes vote Republican ,0
"It was aimed only at one group , a group that Google cynically assumed would vote exclusively for the Democratic Party ",1
"Furthermore , this mobilization effort targeted not only the entire country but swing states vital to the Hillary campaign ",0
"This was not an exercise in civics , this was political consulting ",0
It was in effect an in - kind contribution to the Hillary Clinton campaign ,0
” ,0
"Carlson noted that in communication with Google , the company “ did not deny that the email was real or that it showed a clear political preference ",0
” ,0
"“ Their only defense was that the activities they described were either non - partisan or were not officially taken by the company , ” Carlson said Monday night , describing Google ’s official response to his requests for comment , before challenging the company ’s response : “ But of course they were both ",1
Plenty of people in Google knew what was going on and we have n’t seen any evidence anyone at Google disapproved of it and tried to rein it in ,1
” ,0
The email from Murillo continues by explaining just how expansive the efforts the company undertook to achieve its objective were : ,0
"We had our partners help spread the word about our features on social media , including YouTubers and influencers like Dulce Candy , Jorge Narvaez , Jessie y Joy , Barbara Bermudo , and Pamela Silva of Univision , Jackie Cruz aka La Flaca from Orange is the New Black , and more ",0
"We promoted our partner the Latino Community Foundation ’s non - partisan # YoVoyaVotaryTu ( I ’m going to vote , are you ? ) ",1
campaign and leveraged our social media influencer friends’ reach to hit over 11 M impressions with that hashtag ,1
We hosted an event with over 200 people and a hangout with social media influencers about the power of the Latino vote and the new research Nielsen published about the Latino electorate ,1
This reached 4.4 M social media impressions and signaled to many that Google and our partners value the Latino community and our role in this election ,0
"We brought the same research to the LATISM conference , where people were beyond thrilled to see Google ’s support and acknowledgment of the Latino community ",1
"If Murillo had ended her email there , this probably would not amount to the level of a national news story ",0
"But she did not : She went on for another several paragraphs on the first page and an extra three pages to admit the openly partisan intent of Google ’s actions , including a remarkable in - writing confirmation that at least one of Google ’s actions amounted to a “ silent donation”—something that could raise Federal Election Commission ( FEC ) red flags if authorities decide to launch an official investigation into this matter , now that these emails have been publicly revealed ",1
"It is in the next paragraph that Murillo openly admits that Google made a “ silent donation , ” in her words , paying for rides to polls via leftist organization Voto Latino ",1
Murillo wrote in the next paragraph : ,0
We also supported partners like Voto Latino to pay for rides to the polls in key states ( silent donation ) ,1
We even helped them create ad campaigns to promote the rides ( with support from HOLA folks who rallied and volunteered their time to help ) ,0
We supported Voto Latino to help them land an interview with Senator Meza of Arizona ( key state for us ) to talk about the election and how to use Google search to find information about how to vote ,0
"They were a strong partner , among many in this effort ",0
The next paragraph is where Murillo begins to make her next major admission : that the effort was not just to increase voter turnout generally but to elect Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump ,0
"“ Ultimately , after all was said and done , the Latino community did come out to vote , and completely surprised us , ” Murillo wrote ",0
“ We never anticipated that 29 % of Latinos would vote for Trump ,0
No one did ,1
We saw headlines like this about early voter turn out and thought that this was finally the year that the ‘ sleeping giant’ had awoken ,1
” ,0
"On the next page , the email continues with a headline from an article in The Atlantic by James Fallows : “ 2016 : The Year Latinos Saved America ? ” ",0
"Under that was a tweet from Jon Ralston of Ralston Reports in Nevada saying , among other things , that “ Trump is dead ” because of Latino turnout in early voting in the state ",1
"Trump did not end up winning Nevada in the end , but he did beat Clinton in 30 and a half other states ",0
… ,0
"At that point , after the Ralston tweet , Murillo openly admits the partisan motives of Google ’s electioneering efforts ",1
"“ On personal note , we really thought we had shown up to demonstrate our political power against a candidate who had vehemently offended our community by calling us rapists and drug dealers , ” Murillo wrote ",1
"“ We read the headline and thought WOW , we did it ! ” ",0
"Murillo ’s email continues by including another headline , this time from the New Yorker ’s Benjamin Wallace - Wells : “ Latino Voters Show Trump What It Means to Be American ",1
"” That piece was written on Nov. 7 , 2016 , the day before the election ",0
Then she begins writing again : “ But then reality set in ,0
"Only 71 % of Latinos voted for Hillary , and that was n’t enough ",0
” ,0
The third page of the email begins with another headline and image of a Latina woman in a red Make America Great Again hat and “ Latinos for Trump ” sign ,1
"The story , from Ruben Navarette , Jr. , published in the Daily Beast , is headlined : “ Why the Latino Vote Did n’t Save America ",0
"” The sub - headline , “ Hispanic voters were supposed to be one of Clinton ’s blue firewalls — but one in three ended up splitting for Trump , ” is also included in Murillo ’s Google email ",1
"From there , Murillo continues writing for another page and a half : ",0
"The voters we wanted to reach did end up having an influence in the end , most notably in Florida ",0
"Latino voters voted for Trump more in Florida than in other states ( 31 % ) , and FL was critical by popular vote and the electoral college ",0
We ’ll keep an eye on any other results that can show us the influence that our efforts had on the election ,0
We know we gave this our best and are now figuring out what comes next ,0
Thanks again for all your help and support in this effort ,0
"In the next paragraph , Murillo again openly admits she was not “ objective ” when it came to the election ",1
"“ I have tried to stay objective , but I ask that you please give us some time to pause and reflect , ” Murillo wrote ",0
“ This is devastating for our Democratic Latino community ,1
"After all these efforts and what we thought was positive momentum toward change , the results are not what we expected at all ",0
"We are afraid for our families , and especially for the millions of immigrants who now do n’t know what the future holds for them ",0
” ,0
"After that , Murillo says she can not communicate with key organizers of the effort by Google and its partners — a project known as HOLA — because she is afraid of secret pro - Trump spies on the listservs created ",1
She also admits ongoing discussions among these people about meeting to give grieving Hillary Clinton supporters hugs after Trump crushed her on election day ,1
"She also says those involved in Google ’s get - out - the - vote efforts were openly seeking consolation after Clinton lost , and that she and another person cried after Trump won – for the first time they have cried due to an election result ",1
Murillo wrote : ,0
What ’s most difficult for us is we ca n’t even email the HOLA list to reach our community and discuss what this means for us because we know that apparently some may actually be Trump supporters ,0
"There is a thread right now among the core HOLA group where people are sharing how much they hurt , how much they need support right now , and that they are coordinating in different offices to meet up to just hold each other ",1
"One in a remote office said ‘ If you guys do any sort of meetings , I ’d love to join virtually ",0
I think I ’m currently the only Latinx in my office ,0
It ’s kinda hard.’ # understatement ,0
"Another said , ‘ I ’ve never cried after an election until last night.’ Same here ",1
She was not done there ,0
"In the next paragraph , Murillo wrote that this election result hurt her badly ",1
"She also admits the election result was a “ loss , ” another indication that Google ’s efforts were clearly attempting to use company resources to elect Democrat Clinton over Republican Trump and influence the results of the election ",1
She also says that the company — and herself in particular — will redouble efforts in the future to get a different and more desired result in future elections ,0
"“ I ’m in shock and it hurts more than I could have ever imagined , but trying to stay optimistic and keep my head high , ” Murillo wrote ",1
"“ Loss is a part of life , and I do think frustrations challenge us to work smarter and get creative ",0
My partners have sent notes and are saying the same thing — time to keep working harder ,0
” ,0
"At the top of the fourth page of the email , Murillo asks her colleagues at Google to give out a “ smile ” to grieving leftist Latinos who work at the company ",1
"“ If you see a Latino Googler in the office ( California / New York ) , please give them a smile , ” Murillo wrote ",0
“ They are probably hurting right now ,1
"It ’s tough to handle now that we know not all of us were against this , so we may be even more divided than ever ",0
"At least in CA / NY though , you can rest assured that the Latinos of these blue states need your thoughts and prayers , at least for them and their families ",0
” ,0
"Then , she continues by stating she is going on a planned vacation she thought she was taking to “ celebrate ” a Clinton win , but after Trump won , she says , her vacation “ will be time to reflect on how to continue to support my community through these difficult times ",0
” ,0
"Murillo , in the next line , reveals that she thought she was sharing her viewpoints on these matters in a tight circle that would not leak ",0
"“ I ’m not sharing my personal opinions very broadly , but wanted to share openly here in the circle of trust , ” she wrote ",0
This email leaked to Fox News and Breitbart News and is now likely to become a centerpiece in the case that Google is throwing its weight around to interfere in elections in the United States in a partisan manner against the duly elected President of the United States ,1
This email from Murillo was not just from some rogue staffer inside Google ,1
"Her original email was forwarded on to other Google executives by the aforementioned Gevelber , according to another email obtained by Breitbart News ",0
"“ Thought you all would want to read this , ” Gevelber wrote in her own message endorsing Murillo ’s email in a message to other Google bigwigs ",1
“ It ’s from Eliana Murillo who runs US Hispanic Marketing on my team and who helped found HOLA our Hispanic ERC ,0
” ,0
"Gevelber continued by commending everyone she said , “ worked so hard to ensure all the Get out the Vote were done in Spanish ” that their efforts “ made a giant difference ” in the election “ to Googlers and beyond ",1
” ,0
"President Trump and Republicans have just begun scratching the surface of bias against them among Silicon Valley ’s elite , including , perhaps foremost alongside Facebook , from Google ",1

Ex - Sailor Pardoned By Trump Says He ’s SUING Obama And Comey ,0
"A former Navy sailor , who is one of five people to receive a pardon from President Donald Trump , is planning to file a lawsuit against Obama administration officials ",0
"Kristian Saucier , who served a year in federal prison for taking photos of classified sections of the submarine on which he worked , says he was subject to unequal protection of the law ",0
"Saucier said that he realizes he had erred in taking the photos , which he said he wanted to show only to his family to show them where he worked ",0
"He has also lashed out at Obama officials , saying that his prosecution was politically motivated , prompted by sensitivity about classified information amid the scandal involving Clinton ’s emails ",0
"According to Fox News , Saucier argues that the same officials who sought out punishment to Saucier for his actions chose to be lenient with Hillary Clinton in her use of a private email server and mishandling of classified information ",0
"Saucier ’s lawyer , Ronald Daigle , told Fox News on Monday that the lawsuit , which he expects to file soon in Manhattan , will name the U.S. Department of Justice , former FBI Director James Comey and former President Barack Obama as defendants , among others ",0
"Saucier , who lives in Vermont , pleaded guilty in 2016 to taking photos inside the USS Alexandria while it was stationed in Groton , Connecticut , in 2009 ",0
"He said he only wanted service mementos , but federal prosecutors argued he was a disgruntled sailor who had put national security at risk by taking photos showing the submarine ’s propulsion system and reactor compartment and then obstructed justice by destroying a laptop and camera ",0
–Fox News ,0
"“ They interpreted the law in my case to say it was criminal , ” Saucier told Fox News , referring to prosecuting authorities in his case , “ but they did n’t prosecute Hillary Clinton ",1
Hillary is still walking free ,0
Two guys on my ship did the same thing and were n’t treated as criminals ,1
We want them to correct the wrong ,0
” Daigle said that a notice about the pending lawsuit was sent to the Department of Justice and others included in it in December ,0
There is usually a six - month period that must elapse before the lawsuit actually is actually filed ,0
"“ My case was usually something handled by military courts , ” he said ",0
"“ They used me as an example because of [ the backlash over ] Hillary Clinton , ” he continued , alleging his life was ruined for political reasons ",1
"“ With a pardon , there ’s no magic wand that gets waved and makes everything right , ” Saucier said , “ But I try to stay positive and look forward ",0
” Saucier has had cars repossessed and is in debt due to the loss of income after having a felony on his record ,0
The government actively destroyed his life an made it all but impossible for his family to get back on track ,1
"But Hillary Clinton is running around free , to this day ",0
"And that is what Saucier is so burnt about , with good reason ",0
54 Years Ago Today : Government & Media Created & Spread ‘ Fake News’ to Start Vietnam War ,0
"If you are to believe the official story , one of America ’s deadliest wars in history , Vietnam , was started after the United States had been attacked in the Gulf of Tonkin in the South China Sea ",1
"However , over the past 54 years , a deluge of information and government officials have come forward showing that most everything the government and the media told Americans about the Gulf of Tonkin was a lie ",0
"Often , the American mainstream media becomes a de facto government employee , taking the claims of U.S. officials and reporting them as proven fact — and nothing exemplifies this penchant better than reporting on the Gulf of Tonkin incident — perhaps one of most flagrant lies ever dreamed up as a justification for war ",1
"According to the widely discredited official story , on August 2 , 1964 , the destroyer USS Maddox , while performing a signals intelligence patrol as part of DESOTO operations , was pursued by three North Vietnamese Navy torpedo boats of the 135th Torpedo Squadron ",1
The North Vietnamese torpedo boats then attacked with torpedoes and machine gun fire ,0

"Two days later , according to the official story , on August 4 , 1962 , the NSA reported that a second Gulf of Tonkin incident occurred and US ships were attacked once again ",0
"The next day , without question , on August 5 , 1964 , the New York Times reported “ President Johnson has ordered retaliatory action against gunboats and ‘ certain supporting facilities in North Vietnam’ after renewed attacks against American destroyers in the Gulf of Tonkin ",0
"” Additional outlets , such as the Washington Post , echoed this claim ",0
"The outcome of these two incidents was the passage by Congress of the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution , which granted then - President Lyndon B. Johnson the authority to assist any Southeast Asian country whose government was considered to be jeopardized by “ communist aggression ",0
” The resolution served as Johnson ’s legal justification for deploying U.S. conventional forces and the commencement of open warfare against North Vietnam ,0
"As a result , 58,177 Americans would lose their lives ",1
"Additionally , over one million North and South Vietnamese , including 627,000 civilians would be slaughtered ",1
But it was n’t true ,0
At all ,1
"In fact , the Gulf of Tonkin incident , as it became known , turned out to be a fictitious creation courtesy of the government to escalate war in Vietnam — leading to the deaths of tens of thousands of U.S. troops and millions of Vietnamese , fomenting the largest anti - war movement in American history , and tarnishing the reputation of a nation once considered at least somewhat noble in the eyes of the world ",1
The truth of the matter was that the Maddox was engaged in an aggressive intelligence gathering operation working hand in hand in coordinated attacks on North Vietnam by the South Vietnamese navy and the Laotian air force ,1
When the government announced that it had been the victim of an unprovoked attack — this was a lie ,0
"In the 2003 documentary The Fog of War , the former United States Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara admitted that the August 4 Gulf of Tonkin attack never happened ",0
"In 1995 , McNamara met with former Vietnam People ’s Army General Võ Nguyên Giáp to ask what happened on August 4 , 1964 in the second Gulf of Tonkin Incident ",0
"“ Absolutely nothing ” , Giáp replied ",0
Giáp claimed that the attack had been imaginary ,0
"In 2010 , more than 1,100 transcripts from the Vietnam era were released , proving Congress and officials raised serious doubts about the information fed to them by the Pentagon and White House ",0
"But while this internal grumbling took place , mainstream media dutifully reported official statements as if the veracity of the information could n’t be disputed ",0
"Tom Wells , author of the exhaustive exposé “ The War Within : America ’s Battle Over Vietnam , ” explained the media egregiously erred in “ almost exclusive reliance on U.S. government officials as sources of information ” and “ reluctance to question official pronouncements on ‘ national security issues.’ ” ",0
"If due diligence had been performed , and reporters had raised appropriate doubts about the Gulf of Tonkin false flag , it ’s arguable whether support for the contentious war would have lasted as long as it did and over a million lives would ’ve been saved ",0
"Now , retired military officials — who pay attention to history — are even warning about more staged events to pull us into war ",0
"“ I think the president needs to watch carefully for the potential for something like the Gulf of Tonkin incident , ” Col ",0
Macgregor said ,0
“ Many of your viewers may not remember that it never happened and we could very well be treated to something like that in the Gulf ,0

"Obama Secretly Tried to Get Banks to Aid Iran , Banks Refused ",0
International financial institutions get a lot of heat for terror state ties ,0
But this is a case where Obama Inc. tried to get them to do the wrong thing ,0
While they did the right thing ,0
"The Obama administration secretly sought to give Iran access — albeit briefly — to the U.S. financial system by sidestepping sanctions kept in place after the 2015 nuclear deal , despite repeatedly telling Congress and the public it had no plans to do so ",0
Yet another Obama dirty deal with Iran that we 're just learning about now ,1
The question is how many more are there ? ,1
And that 's part of why Spygate is happening ,0
The assault is also a cover - up ,0
"The report by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations revealed that under President Barack Obama , the Treasury Department issued a license in February 2016 , never previously disclosed , that would have allowed Iran to convert $ 5.7 billion it held at a bank in Oman from Omani rials into euros by exchanging them first into U.S. dollars ",0
"If the Omani bank had allowed the exchange without such a license , it would have violated sanctions that bar Iran from transactions that touch the U.S. financial system ",0
The effort was unsuccessful because American banks — themselves afraid of running afoul of U.S. sanctions — declined to participate ,0
"The Obama administration approached two U.S. banks to facilitate the conversion , the report said , but both refused , citing the reputational risk of doing business with or for Iran ",0
That 's how bad Obama was on Iran ,1
The banking system was more reluctant to help Iran launder money than he was ,0
Nor was Obama worried about the reputational risk of loading foreign currency on unmarked cargo planes and flying it to Iran ,0
Issuing the license was not illegal ,0
"Still , it went above and beyond what the Obama administration was required to do under the terms of the nuclear agreement ",0
Except Obama Inc. were n't trying to drive a hard bargain ,0
So they did n't stick to it ,0
They were trying to aid Iran ,0
"Shortly after the nuclear deal was sealed in July 2015 , then - Treasury Secretary Jack Lew testified that even with the sanctions relief , Iran “ will continue to be denied access to the world ’s largest financial and commercial market ",0
"” A month later , one of Lew ’s top deputies , Adam Szubin , testified that despite the nuclear deal “ Iran will be denied access to the world ’s most important market and unable to deal in the world ’s most important currency ",1
” ,0
This was typical of the worthless assurances that Obama officials made ,1
And disgraced themselves by doing so ,1
Obama administration officials at the time assured concerned lawmakers that a general license would n’t be coming ,0
"But the report from the Republican members of the Senate panel showed that a draft of the license was indeed prepared , though it was never published ",0
"And when questioned by lawmakers about the possibility of granting Iran any kind of access to the U.S. financial system , Obama - era officials never volunteered that the specific license for Bank Muscat in Oman had been issued two months earlier ",0
"Scandal - free administration , folks ",1
Not a single scandal to see here ,1

"Last week , the Florida Department of State asked federal prosecutors to look into alterations made on official election documents from the 2018 midterms ",0
Politico reported that the department points to the Florida Democratic Party for changing dates on forms used to amend absentee and mail - in ballots ,0
These ballots would have been flagged for missing information or for being filled out with incorrect information ,0
"The amending forms , called “ cure affidavits , ” were due at 5 p.m on Nov. 5 , the evening before Election Day , at the latest ",0
"During pre - Election Day absentee and mail - in voting , political parties have access to lists of people whose mail - in ballots were rejected for errors ",0
"Meanwhile , cure affidavits are publicly available and anyone can send them to voters to prompt them to “ fix ” their ballots ",0
"According to Politico , the DOS released affidavits on Tuesday , which demonstrate that four different counties said the ballots could be returned by 5 p.m on Thursday , Nov. 8 , past the official due date ",0
"Among the counties involved with the altered affidavits is Broward , which has been a hotspot for controversy as many Florida races have led to a recount ",0

Politico reported that they received audio of a Florida Democratic party volunteer leaving a voicemail to a voter in Palm Beach County to revise their mailed ballot after Election Day ,0
Palm Beach County failed to make Florida ’s recount deadline on Thursday ,0
"Matt Dixon , bureau chief of Politico , tweeted on Wednesday that the Democratic party volunteer call came during Florida ’s ballot recount after ballots were allowed to be amended ",0
"“ We are now doing a recount , so we want to make sure you let your vote be counted , ” Dixon quoted from the voicemail ",0
It seems that Democrats may have called absentee voters about supplying them with cure affidavits after the permitted date ,0
"It also looks like whoever sent out the cure affidavits physically changed the due date to say Nov. 8 , instead of Nov. 6 ",0
"Bradley McVay , DOS interim general counsel , asked attorneys in Florida to investigate the conflicting dates ",1
"“ Altering a form in a manner that provides the incorrect date for a voter to cure a defect … imposes a burden on the voter significant enough to frustrate the voter ’s ability to vote , ” McVay wrote in a letter , sent on Nov. 9 and publicly released on Tuesday ",1
"According to DOS officials , they are less concerned with the inaccurate dates , and more concerned with the fact that the cure affidavits appear to have been deliberately altered ",0
State officials turned over the altered forms to federal investigators ,0
"Of the many allegations of ballot mishandling in Florida , this is the first that has been referred to the federal government ",0
While Democrats seem to have told voters they could fix ballot errors up to the Thursday after Election Day — these votes could not count ,0
It looks like Democrats may have hurt their own interests by misleading their voters ,1
"They may have believed that they were supplying the correct information , but they still should not have altered official documents without verifying that they were right , which they were n’t ",1
It is yet to be determined whether the federal investigation will find Democratic ineptitude or deception in this case ,1

"The Sun is getting cooler and dimmer , but scientists are n’t worried ",1
"In what is being considered a particularly rare event , scientists are projecting that the Sun will be an unusually cool customer by the year 2050 ",0
"By combining data and observations from decades of Sun research , experts are predicting a “ Grand Solar Minimum ” will occur a few decades from now , making our parent star dimmer and cooler than it has been for a very long time ",0
"The Sun might look the same to you today as it has since the first time you laid eyes on it , but our star actually displays plenty of changes ",0
"The Sun goes through regular cycles of solar minimums and solar maximums , which are periods where the Sun is either quite calm ( the minimum ) or incredibly active ( the maximum ) ",0
"These patterns repeat every 11 years or so , but new research suggests that there ’s a pattern behind the pattern , and that a particularly cool solar minimum is on the way ",0
"The study , which was published in Astrophysical Journal Letters , was carried out by a team led by physicist Dan Lubin of the University of California , San Diego ",0
"After combing the data , Lubin ’s team has forecasted a grand minimum that will be around seven percent cooler than the typical solar minimum , making it a particularly calm moment for our star ",0
"During a solar minimum , the Sun produces far fewer solar flares and sunspots , and as a result , much less ultraviolet radiation is shot out into space and towards Earth ",0
"This can have a number of effects on our planet , including changes in the thickness of the stratospheric ozone layer and temperatures far above ground ",0
"Those changes can affect weather , though forecasting specific differences has proven difficult ",0
"The grand minimum will be an exaggerated version of the typical solar minimum , and could produce some very noticeable effects ",0
The most recent grand minimum is thought to have occurred back in the mid 1600s ,0
"The event , called the Maunder Minimum , is credited with plunging temperatures to the point where the Thames River and Baltic Sea froze over ",0
"However , other parts of the planet heated up , including Alaska and Greenland , to far above their normal highs ",0
"This temporary shakeup of temperatures could happen again , though the researchers say it will have very little effect on the overall global warming trend that mankind has created for itself ",1
' Textbook Definition of Bias ' ,0
"On Monday , DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz testified with FBI boss Christopher Wray before the Senate Judiciary Committee ",0
"In a predictable performance , the duo cited mistakes and raised concerns but solved none of the lingering mysteries the massive report released last week that found anti - Trump bias did not affect FBI and DOJ decisions ",0
On Tuesday Horowitz performed solo before a joint session of the House Oversight and Judiciary Committees ,0
Oversight chairman Trey Gowdy delivered the opening statement ,0
"The attorney general had been accused of “ softening or watering down his report , ” Gowdy said , “ When the reality is it was Jim Comey who softened and watered down his press release , announcing no charges against Secretary Clinton ",0
"We see Jim Comey and Jim Comey alone deciding which DOJ policies to follow and which to ignore , to decide whether there is sufficient evidence to support each and every element of an offense and we see Jim Comey and Jim Comey alone deciding whether to send a letter to Congress in the throes of looming election ",1
” ,0
"In a devastating exchange with Horowitz , Gowdy said that “ prejudging the outcome of an investigation before it ends , and prejudging the outcome of an investigation before it begins ” is the “ textbook definition of bias ",1
” Democrats echoed the IG report ’s conclusion that there was no bias ,0
Republicans sought to tie up some loose threads ,0
The IG report confirmed that President Obama communicated with Hillary Clinton on her unsecured email system ,0
Horowitz said the president had been one of 13 who had done so ,0
Rep. Steve King asked about the volume of communications between the president and Clinton ,0
"“ I ’ll have to get back to you on that , ” Horowitz said , and the IG was “ not sure ” if any of the communications had involved classified or top secret material ",0
"If the IG did know the subject of the president ’s communications with Clinton , he failed to reveal any details ",0
Horowitz “ would have to ask ” if his team interviewed any officials at the Obama White House but said “ not the president himself ,0
” ,0
"Rep. King asked Horowitz about his first encounter with the switch of “ extremely careless ” for ‘ gross negligence , ” which violated a criminal statute ",1
"Horowitz found that Peter Strzok , Lisa Page , and James Comey were all involved ",0
"The IG also said his team focused on the fact that the classified material on Clinton ’s server was “ not clearly marked , ” which repeated one of Clinton ’s claims about her negligence ",1
"As for the question of her “ intent , ” Horowitz said it arose “ months earlier , ” maybe in 2015 , though he could n’t be sure ",0
King said President Obama had suggested the “ careless but not intentional ” language in a “ 60 Minutes ” appearance in October of 2015 ,0
"And King had observed that in his July 5 , 2016 statement , James Comey used “ intent ” six times ",0
"Horowitz said Comey “ concealed from the attorney general and the deputy attorney general , his intention to make a unilateral announcement in July 2016 about the reasons for his recommendations not to prosecute former Secretary Clinton ",0
"” The IG also described his report as a “ thorough , comprehensive and objective recitation of the facts ",0
” ,0
"The IG did confirm that Peter Strzok and Lisa Page worked on the Clinton investigation , the Russia and the Mueller team ",0
Horowitz said Strzok and Page had exchanged “ tens of thousands of texts ,0
” Ohio Rep. James Jordan asked Horowitz when his team had discovered the message about “ we ’ll stop ” Trump ,0
Horowitz conceded that this meant “ stop Trump from becoming president ,0
"” The IG said they uncovered that text in May , and Jordan asked “ why did we not see it until last Thursday ? ” ",0
"“ I ca n’t answer that , ” Horowitz said , adding that it had been sent to Rod Rosenstein ’s department at the DOJ ",0
Jordan concluded that Rosenstein “ made the decision that we had to wait a month ,0
” ,0
Several representatives were curious about two FBI agents and one lawyer the IG report had not named ,0
"“ The FBI raised a concern because they work on counterintelligence matters , ” Horowitz said ",0
"Rep Mark Meadows asked if the two FBI agents were Kevin Clinesmith and Sally Moyer , which the IG declined to confirm ",0
"“ They do n’t work in counterintelligence , ” said Meadows , who charged that the FBI gave the IG “ false information ” and altered key witness reports ",0
“ How did Comey see the report before it came out ? ” Rep. Darrell Issa wanted to know ,0
"Horowitz said Comey did n’t see the whole thing , but explained that he allowed those the IG team had criticized to have a look before release ",0
"By the end of the day it was evident that Congress would have to hear from Comey , Rosenstein , Strzok and others ",0
Horowitz confirmed that the IG is investigating whether FBI official Peter Strzok ’s anti - Trump bias factored into the launch of the bureau ’s Russia probe ,0
Also on Tuesday Peter Strzok was “ escorted ” from the FBI building ,0
"As his lawyer told reporters , Strzok had “ played by the rules , ” but been targeted by “ unfounded personal attacks , political games and inappropriate information leaks ",0
” ,0
"“ I hope he comes and portrays himself as a victim , ” Trey Gowdy told Fox News ",0
Rep. Bob Goodlatte said the committee would issue a subpoena for Strzok to testify “ next week ,0

"were never fulfilled , ” said Phil Saviano , an abuse survivor who founded the New England chapter of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests ",0

"Saviano said the commission is “ a good idea , ” and added , “ I ’m not particularly optimistic that much will get accomplished , but a commission is better than no commission ",0

"Given his long experience witnessing the church ’s inertia on the issue , Saviano said , he has set his expectations at rock bottom ",1
"“ That ’s kind of my attitude now : If I do n’t expect the Catholic Church to do anything , then I wo n’t be too disappointed when they do n’t do anything , ” he continued ",1
"Jim Scanlan , another survivor , said “ the timing of it is too perfect ” given the controversy last month surrounding Pope Francis ’s remarks that accused victims of a notorious Chilean pedophile priest , the Rev. ",1
"Fernando Karadima , of “ slander ” against Bishop Juan Barros , who the victims say was complicit in a cover up ",1
"The pope said he had seen no proof of Barros ’s guilt , but the Associated Press reported that O’Malley and other members of the commission had in 2015 hand - delivered to him an eight - page letter from a survivor that graphically detailed his abuse and said Barros and other clergy had witnessed him being fondled but had not intervened ",0

Scanlan said his reaction to hearing that Francis has revived the commission was “ hopeful but cynical ,0
"” Like Saviano , he said the panel accomplished little in its first incarnation ",0
"“ My expectation is it will probably have the same outcome , because the church is the church , and they do it for appearance , but they ’re still going to go by their own rules , ” he said ",0
“ I ’ve seen little that has changed ,1

"Scanlan said Pope Francis has given him hope for progress on some issues in the church , but on sexual abuse , he “ continues to be blind to what the church has done ",1

"Last month , O’Malley denounced the pope ’s controversial defense of the Chilean bishop ",0
"Despite distancing himself from Pope Francis ’s comments , O’Malley said that he has witnessed the pontiff ’s genuine compassion for abuse victims ",0

The Islamization of the Public Schools ,0
Muslims anxious to use schools and textbooks to proselytize for Islam have found a welcoming environment in American public schools that are indefatigably committed to multiculturalism ,0
"With the imperative to be “ tolerant ” robbing many educators of their ability to evaluate non - Western cultures critically , all too many public schools and individual teachers have proven to be susceptible to an organized campaign by U.S .- based Islamic organizations and their primary benefactor , Saudi Arabia , to present a view of Islam that whitewashes its violent history and intolerant doctrines ",1
Many of the Islamic groups that vet American public school textbooks for the accuracy of their material on Islamic doctrine and history are Saudi - funded ,0
They make sure that the Islamic instruction in these textbooks presents a picture of Islam that is so pristine and whitewashed that it sometimes crosses the boundary from mere pro - Muslim bias into outright Islamic proselytizing ,1
"The taboo about teaching religion in the public schools , so zealously established and guarded against Christian prayer by the ACLU and the Supreme Court over the last few decades , is increasingly set aside in American public schools , as presentations on Islam frequently cross the line between teaching facts about the religion and teaching the religion as fact ",1

"” Parent Libby Hilsenrath characterized the accompanying assignment as “ replete with biased , chastising statements encouraging the students … to follow the Quran and become Muslim ",1

"The complaint adds : “ Due to the fact that these doctrinal messages calling for conversion to Islam were included in video format with vivid images and text , they possess greater communicative impact and are more likely to be accepted by the students viewing them than information that is spoken in a classroom or even written in a book ",0

"I did n’t have a problem with the history of Islam being taught , but to go so far as to make my child write the Shahada , is unacceptable ",1

Security Guard Jesus Campos Shot During The Vegas Massacre Raises New Questions About Official Narrative ,0
"The infamous security guard at the Mandalay Bay Hotel , who was allegedly shot stopping the massacre in Las Vegas over a week ago is not listed or registered as such ",0
"Jesus Campos , who the narrative is constantly changing around , is still a source of mystery ",0
So who is Jesus Campos ? ,0
"That burning question has bothered many since the release of his name , but there ’s been no photograph of this alleged hero , even though we ’ve already seen crime scene images of the guns Stephen Paddock allegedly dragged up to his 32nd - floor hotel room ",0
"The ever - changing narrative now though , seems to swirl around this unknown mystery security guard ",0
"At first , Campos , a guard at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino , was hailed a hero for helping guide police to gunman Stephen Paddock ’s room on the 32nd floor ",0
Police said Campos was shot in the leg at the end of Paddock ’s assault on concertgoers — potentially distracting the gunman and causing him to panic and kill himself ,0
"But now , questions have been raised after Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo revised the timeline and said Campos had actually been shot about 9:59 p.m. a ( full six minutes before the mass shooting began at 10:05 p.m. ) which means the guard could have instead led Paddock to start opening fire on the crowd for fear of being caught ",0
"Police have said it was difficult to identify the source of the bullets during the attack , and the confusion added more minutes to their lengthy response ",0
But the revised timeline shows officers would have known where Paddock was before the mass shooting even started ,0
Did Campos call 911 ? ,0
What happened during those six minutes ? ,0
Much of Campos ’s story and background remains a mystery ,0
–Newsweek ,0
"Campos ’s co - worker Liliana Rodriguez started a GoFundMe account for him on October 3 , explaining that he ’d been shot while on “ random patrol ” and it could have been anyone of us ",0
"“ Funds will be used to provide relief and financial support for him while he gets back on his feet , ” Rodriguez ’s online petition says ",0
“ This is a young man that I work with day in and day out ,0
Any financial support would be appreciated for the time he would need to recover ,0
” ,0
"Strangely , a picture of Campos was n’t displayed as part of the fund because Rodriguez indicated that “ due to privacy from the media we do not feel comfortable publishing a photo ",0
” ,0
There are obviously certain things that the FBI and other investigators seem intent on covering up ,1
Their own narrative is quickly shattering ,0
"Las Vegas Metro Police Undersheriff Kevin McMahill explained more about Campos ’s actions the night of the shooting , helping fill in some of what happened ahead of the attack , but unfortunately , it only added more questions and gave little in the way of answers ",0
"McMahill told KNPR , a local NPR affiliate , that Campos went up to the 32nd floor to investigate a door alarm ",0
"While on the 32nd floor , he found that a stairwell door was jammed and radioed down to maintenance ",0
Campos heard a drilling sound and thought it was odd ,0
A maintenance worker came up to the 32nd floor ,0
"As the pair started talking , Paddock began firing through the door of his room , first with a single - fire gun and then with a rapid - fire rifle ",0
"Police have said that when Campos radioed what happened , it helped them track where Paddock was holed up – so why change the narrative to make it even more unbelievable ? ",1
"And still , none of this explains why Campos is not registered as a security guard either , and why the timeline is being changed publically ",0
What exactly do they want us to believe ? ,1

"MAJOR NEW STUDY : Homeschooling Spikes Due to School Violence , Far - Left Bias ",1
"According to a 33-year - long study conducted by the National Home Education Research Institute in Oregon , the top three reasons that parents choose homeschooling are a desire to provide religious instruction or different values than those offered in public schools ; dissatisfaction with the academic curriculum , and worries about the school environment ",0

Asteroid Will Skim By Earth Days Before Christmas : It Is ‘ Potentially Hazardous’ ,0
An asteroid called 3200 Phaethon will skim past the Earth just days before many will celebrate with Christmas festivities ,0
"The three - mile - wide asteroid is expected to miss the Earth , but it ’s still labeled as “ potentially hazardous , ” and for good reasons ",0
"With a diameter of about 3 miles , the asteroid named 3200 Phaethon ( after the Greek demi - god who , according to legend , nearly set the Earth on fire ) is classified as “ potentially hazardous ” by the Minor Planet Center ",1

Much closer flybys have occurred in the very recent past ,0
"Scientists at NASA ’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory are planning to use the opportunity to obtain a detailed 3D model of the asteroid , which has a particularly irregular shape ",0
"First detected in December 2007 , 3200 Phaethon is widely thought to be the parent body for the Geminid meteor shower , which is due to peak this year on the night of December 13 ",0

Pompeo offers defense for Saudi rulers as Trump administration strategy shifts in Khashoggi case ,0
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo expressed confidence Wednesday that the Saudi government could be trusted to investigate the disappearance and suspected murder of a U.S .- based Saudi journalist in a Saudi diplomatic facility in Turkey — despite the likelihood that senior Saudi officials were involved ,0
"Speaking in Ankara , Turkey , Pompeo offered that support hours after President Donald Trump had mounted an even stronger defense for the Saudi rulers , saying , “ Here we go again with you ’re guilty until proven innocent ",0
” ,0
Together they appeared to signal a shift in White House strategy — earlier this week Trump had warned Saudi rulers could face “ severe punishment ” — and suggested the administration has decided to help its most important ally in the Arab world defuse an international crisis over the fate of Jamal Khashoggi ,1
"The dissident journalist , who lived in Virginia , vanished Oct. 2 after he entered the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul , Turkey ",0
Neither Trump nor his top diplomat offered any new facts or insights in the case ,0
"But unless authorities recover his body or other conclusive evidence of his death , the mystery may remain unsolved ",0
"Pompeo wrapped up two days of emergency talks in the region — first with Saudi King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh , and then with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara — and headed back to Washington on Wednesday ",0
"Turkish officials have described — but have not released — what they say are audio and video recordings that show the 60-year - old contributor to the Washington Post opinion pages was interrogated , tortured and killed by Saudi intelligence officers inside the consulate ",1
"Turkish officials say Khashoggi ’s body was cut up with a bone saw , then taken out of the building ",1
Turkish crime scene investigators and forensic specialists were allowed to search for evidence in the Saudi consulate and a nearby residence on Tuesday ,0
Erdogan later complained that the interior walls had been repainted in recent days ,0
"On his flight from Riyadh to Ankara , Pompeo reiterated his confidence that the Saudi government would conduct a “ thorough , complete , and transparent investigation , ” adding that they will “ show the entire world ” the results ",1
"He said Saudi leaders made a commitment “ to hold anyone connected to any wrongdoing that may be found accountable for that , whether they are a senior officer or official ",0
"” He said they made “ no exceptions , ” including presumably members of the royal family ",0
"Asked if the Saudis had informed him whether Khashoggi was alive or dead , Pompeo said , “ I do n’t want to talk about any of the facts ",0
"They did n’t want to either , in that they want to have the opportunity to complete this investigation in a thorough way ",0
” ,0
"Asked if he believed the Saudi rulers’ repeated denial of complicity , Pompeo said he was reserving judgment ",0
"“ I think that ’s — I think that ’s — I think that ’s a reasonable thing to do , to give them that opportunity , ” Pompeo said , “ ( and then ) we ’ll all get to evaluate the work that they do ",0
” ,0
"Pompeo refused to discuss possible consequences for those found responsible for Khashoggi ’s disappearance , reiterating at least three times the “ importance of the investigation ",0
” ,0
"Later Wednesday , Pompeo said during a refueling stopover in Brussels that Erdogan had informed him the Saudis were cooperating with the Turkish investigation “ after a couple of delays ",0
” ,0
"Turkish officials “ seemed pretty confident the Saudis will permit them to do things they need to do to complete ” the investigation , Pompeo told reporters traveling with him ",0
"In a sign that the administration is looking to help Saudi Arabia get out of its dilemma , Pompeo urged Americans to be mindful of the extensive energy , economic and security ties between Riyadh and Washington , including efforts against what he called the world ’s largest supporter of terrorism , Iran ",0
"“ The Saudis have been great partners in working alongside us on these issues , ” Pompeo said ",1
"“ We need to make sure we are mindful of that as we approach decisions ” on whether to impose sanctions or take other punitive steps against Riyadh , as many in Congress and elsewhere have urged ",0
"Critics questioned whether the Saudi rulers , who preside over an authoritarian regime that allows little opposition , can be relied on to conduct a credible probe into Khashoggi ’s fate — especially without decisive pressure from their close ally , the Trump administration ",0
Saudi leaders for two weeks denied knowing anything about the Khashoggi case ,0
"On Monday , they began floating a scenario — initially adopted by Trump — that blamed the murder inside the consulate on “ rogue killers , ” and then suggested the writer was accidentally killed during an interrogation that went awry ",0
Analysts familiar with the desert kingdom said it was likely Saudi leaders were hoping the scandal would blow over and that they could wait it out ,0
"“ We received commitments that they would complete this ( investigation ) , and I am counting on them to do that , ” Pompeo said ",0
“ They gave me their word ,0

"Ex - Sailor Pardoned By Trump , Sues Obama And Comey For NOT Prosecuting Hillary ",0
The former Navy sailor pardoned by President Donald Trump after serving a year in federal prison for taking photos of classified sections of his submarine filed a lawsuit on Monday against Obama administration officials ,0
The ex - sailor is alleging that he was subject to unequal protection of the law and cites Comey and Obama ’s willingness to not prosecute Hillary Clinton ,0
"Barack Obama and former FBI director James Comey let Hillary off the hook before the election , while Kristian Saucier served hard time ",0
Saucier says that that action was “ unfair ” and “ unequal ” compared to the corruption and criminal activity of Hillary Clinton ,0
Saucier told Fox News he was scapegoated by Obama officials who found themselves under fire for not aggressively responding to Clinton ’s handling of classified information through her private email servers ,1
"According to Fox News , Saucier ’s federal lawsuit alleges that the United States government was “ overzealous ” in prosecuting him for “ mishandling classified information ” while going easy on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for more serious violations of the same law ",1
"Saucier ’s lawsuit names as defendants former President Barack Obama , former U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch , former FBI Director James Comey , former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe , and Peter Strzok , the FBI agent who led the inquiry into Clinton ’s email account ",0
"“ I could have just taken the pardon by President Trump and gone on with my life , ” Saucier said to Fox News , adding that he feels an obligation to get to the truth of what he sees as a double standard that let Clinton get off scot - free ",0
"“ The U.S. Constitution clearly states that all citizens are born with inalienable rights to be free from persecution by the government , ” Saucier said ",0
“ My conviction and subsequent sentence for a minor military infraction compared to the treatment of politically connected individuals is a glaring example of a violation of the rights of all Americans to have equal protection under the law ,1
” ,0
"The former Navy sailor is acting as his own attorney after the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court New York barred his lawyer , Ronald Daigle , from practicing for one year ",0
"The court ’s move came just as Daigle was helping Saucier prepare to file the lawsuit , prompting the navy sailor to accuse New York officials of trying to hinder his court fight against Obama , Comey , and others ",0
–Fox News ,0
"Saucier said that he realizes he had erred in taking the photos of the submarine , which he said he wanted to show only to his family so that they could see where he worked ",0
"He has also lashed out at Obama officials , saying that his prosecution was politically motivated , prompted by sensitivity about classified information amid the scandal involving Clinton ’s emails ",0
"Las Vegas Shooting Victim : “ There Was 100 % More Than One Shooter , ” Gates To Concert Were Locked Shortly Before Attack ",0
"Las Vegas mass shooting victim Rocky Palermo was shot in the pelvis during the horrific attack and is now speaking out about what he saw and believes happened , including the presence of multiple shooters as well as locked concert gates and police telling frantic civilians to go in the other direction ",0
"Palermo , who has done various interviews since the attack , appeared on “ The Blast ” with a series of shocking comments that correlate with various other reports indicating that multiple shooters carried out the attack and that the FBI is actively covering this up ",1
"“ I definitely do believe that there was 100 % more than one shooter , every other person that I ’ve talked to that did unfortunately get hit as well , have all said the same things , ” Palermo detailed ",0
"The man then goes on to explain that after being shot he ran “ about 200 yards ” to hide behind a car , all the while hearing bullets fly past him at what he believes was ground level ",0
"“ I ’m waiting and all of a sudden we hear a little whizzing going by us , all of a sudden bullets are just flying by , ” he continued ",0
“ When something is coming up and down or at least from a different angle they are either going to hit the ground or … alot of different things are going to happen ,1
"When someone is shooting form a horizontal line its just going to keep shooting , ” Palermo attempted to explain ",0
Take note that what he means here is that people were being shot at from ground level rather than the 32nd floor of the hotel ,1
Palermo then specifically heard the gun shots get “ closer and closer ” before quickly deciding it was once again time to run ,0
"Shockingly , he then goes on to detail the fact that at the end of the concert the previous two nights everyone had exited a specific way but on the night of the shooting this route was locked down shortly before the attack ",0
"“ Every other night at the concert , everybody kinda exited right off Las Vegas Blvd , that was standard , that was routine , you get out of the concert and you go down to the next casino , ” he continued ",0
"“ At 10 pm they closed every exit on Las Vegas Blvd , every single one ",0
"They gated them all closed with chain - link fences , 10:08 the shooting started and we were pigs sitting in a corral ",0
We only had one exit to go out of … .. everyone was just kinda following the sheep ,0
” ,0
Palermo makes clear this confused concert goers who had used the normal exits in the past ,0
“ The same exits we had came in and left Friday and Saturday night were definitely closed ,0
"There were people that went over there and tried to leave and there were cops that were telling them no , you ca n’t go out here , you have to go the other way , ” he shockingly concluded ",0
This stunning testimony is obviously a huge bombshell in the ongoing investigation of the Las Vegas mass shooting and is sure to continue to add credence to the growing belief that we are not being told what actually happened that fateful night ,1
‘ Suicide Note’ Seen in Vegas Shooter ’s Hotel Room ,0
"A mysterious piece of paper discovered last week , when photos from the Las Vegas gunman ’s hotel room were leaked to the media , is now back in the news cycle ",0
The pictures were published by numerous news outlets and shared by millions of people on social media ,0
"At the time the photos were published by the Daily Mail , police had not mentioned if Paddock left behind a note in his hotel room ",0
Nevada Sheriff Joe Lombardo said police were investigating who leaked the crime scene photos ,0
"In one photo in particular , a white piece of paper or notepad on a side table next to a chair is visible , which caused some to speculate that it may have been a suicide note ",0
"Soon after the photos were leaked , Twitter was abuzz with chatter referencing the paper , with people spreading cover - up conspiracies and rumors that it was a suicide note ",1

It appears the Las Vegas Shooter left a suicide note ,0
"pic.twitter.com/ATtPMR6cUN — STUMP 4 TRUMP ( @Stump4TrumpPAC ) October 3 , 2017 ",0
"On Thursday , investigators revealed that the note in the photo was not , in fact , a suicide note but neglected to provide further details about the purpose of the note ",0
"In their first in - depth interview , which will air on CBS Sunday evening , the officers who stormed Stephen Paddock ’s hotel room revealed new details to 60 Minutes that finally explain what was written on the mysterious note ",0
"“ I could see on it he had written the distance , the elevation he was on , the drop of what his bullet was gon na be for the crowd , ” said Officer Dave Newton from the Las Vegas Police in a preview clip of Sunday ’s report ",0
“ So he had that written down and figured out so he would know where to shoot to hit his targets from there ,0
” ,0
Paddock ’s note was clearly not a suicide letter ,0
"Rather , it detailed bullet trajectory and included calculations about where he needed to aim his weapons to maximize accuracy and optimize his kill rate ",0
Investigators have also been looking for a ‘ mystery woman’ who was seen with Stephen Paddock in the days leading up to the Las Vegas shooting ,0
"According to ABC News , the ‘ mystery woman’ everyone on the internet was talking about has been identified ",0
"While officials did not reveal the woman ’s name , they did tell reporters she was a prostitute ",1
Police are still investigating whether or not Paddock acted alone ,1
They believe he may have had an accomplice based on the elaborate planning needed to undertake such a massacre and the fact that some ammunition was purchased under someone else ’s name ,1
As ABC reported Friday evening : ,0
"“ Meantime , investigators are still trying to figure out whether Paddock acted alone ",0
"Authorities believe he may have had an accomplice , based on the elaborate planning on Sunday night ’s rampage ",0
"Officials also believe he had help because of the amount of guns in his hotel room , and because some of the ammo was bought under someone else ’s name ",1

"Though more details are being released each day , Paddock ’s motives remain unclear ",0
Agencies scramble to prep Russia probe files for release after sweeping Trump order ,1
Intelligence agencies were scrambling Tuesday to comply with a sweeping order by President Trump to declassify key documents that could shed light on the origins of the Russia collusion probe that has hamstrung the administration for more than 18 months ,1
The documents Trump ordered declassified involve a renewed Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant against former campaign aide Carter Page and text messages from disgraced former FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page ,1
"The president on Monday afternoon ordered that the documents be released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence ( ODNI ) and the Justice Department “ [ a]t the request of a number of committees of Congress , and for reasons of transparency , ” according to a statement issued by White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders ",0
"It is not immediately clear how and when the documents will be released , but by Monday evening , intelligence agencies said they had already begun working to prepare the documents ",0
"“ When the President issues such an order , it triggers a declassification review process that is conducted by various agencies within the intelligence community , in conjunction with the White House Counsel , to seek to ensure the safety of America ’s national security interests , ” a Justice Department spokesperson said in a statement to Fox News ",0
“ The Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are already working with the Director of National Intelligence to comply with the President ’s order ,0
” ,0
ODNI spokeswoman Kellie Wade also said that the agency was “ working expeditiously with our interagency partners to conduct a declassification review of the documents the President has identified for declassification ,0
” ,0
"The documents include all FBI reports on interviews , also known as 302s , with Justice Department official Bruce Ohr and all FBI reports of interviews prepared in connection with applications to surveil Carter Page , as well as 21 pages of one renewed warrant ",0
The 21 pages make up only a small portion of the 412 pages of FISA applications and warrants related to Page released by the FBI earlier this year in a heavily redacted format ,0
The June 2017 application was the last of four filed by the Justice Department in support of FISA court orders allowing the monitoring of Page for nearly a year ,0
"The president also ordered the release of unredacted text messages from fired FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok , former FBI counsel Lisa Page , former FBI Director James Comey and former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe ",1
"The president for months has blasted Strzok and Page for the bias revealed in their text messages , as well as Comey and McCabe for their leadership of the FBI ",1
Comey was fired from the bureau in May 2017 ; McCabe was fired by Attorney General Jeff Sessions in March ; Page left the bureau in May ; and Strzok was fired last month ,0
"A source familiar with the timing of the declassification told Fox News they expected the Carter Page warrant application to be declassified first , followed by the FBI reports on agent interviews with Ohr ",0
"The source added that the Justice Department is working on a """""""" compressed timeline """""""" and they expect the first release of records in days or sooner ",0
The text messages are expected to take longer because of the sheer number involved and the fact that Trump ordered their release without redactions ,1
"Republicans on Capitol Hill , including House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes , R - Calif ",0
", are touting the president ’s order , saying it covers “ pretty much everything that he wanted … and the text messages are a bonus , ” a source said of Nunes ",1
"Congressional Republicans are hoping the files reveal details about the start of the Russia investigation led by the FBI , which evolved into Special Counsel Robert Mueller 's investigation into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates during the 2016 presidential election ",0
"But Democrats , including the committee ’s ranking member , Rep. Adam Schiff , D - Calif ",0
", are blasting the declassification order as a “ clear abuse of power ",1
” ,0
""""""""" [ Trump ] has decided to intervene in a pending law enforcement investigation by ordering the selective release of materials he believes are helpful to his defense team and thinks will advance a false narrative , """""""" Schiff said ",1
""""""""" With respect to some of these materials , I have been previously informed by the FBI and Justice Department that they would consider their release a red line that must not be crossed as they may compromise sources and methods ",1
""""""""" This is evidently of no consequence to a President who cares about nothing about the country and everything about his narrow self - interest , """""""" Schiff added ",1
"The president ’s order is similar to his February move , when he cleared the way for the Republican - led House Intelligence Committee to release a partisan memo about the surveillance warrant on Carter Page ",1
"Democrats , weeks later , released their own version of the memo ",0
Assange Never Met Manafort ,0
Luke Harding and the Guardian Publish Still More Blatant MI6 Lies ,1
"The right wing Ecuadorean government of President Moreno continues to churn out its production line of fake documents regarding Julian Assange , and channel them straight to MI6 mouthpiece Luke Harding of the Guardian ",1
"Amazingly , more Ecuadorean Government documents have just been discovered for the Guardian , this time spy agency reports detailing visits of Paul Manafort and unspecified “ Russians ” to the Embassy ",1
"By a wonderful coincidence of timing , this is the day after Mueller announced that Manafort ’s plea deal was over ",1
The problem with this latest fabrication is that Moreno had already released the visitor logs to the Mueller inquiry ,0
Neither Manafort nor these “ Russians ” are in the visitor logs ,1
This is impossible ,0
"The visitor logs were not kept by Wikileaks , but by the very strict Ecuadorean security ",0
Nobody was ever admitted without being entered in the logs ,0
The procedure was very thorough ,0
"To go in , you had to submit your passport ( no other type of document was accepted ) ",0
A copy of your passport was taken and the passport details entered into the log ,0
"Your passport , along with your mobile phone and any other electronic equipment , was retained until you left , along with your bag and coat ",0
I feature in the logs every time I visited ,0
There were no exceptions ,0
"For an exception to be made for Manafort and the “ Russians ” would have had to be a decision of the Government of Ecuador , not of Wikileaks , and that would be so exceptional the reason for it would surely have been noted in the now leaked supposed Ecuadorean “ intelligence report ” of the visits ",1
What possible motive would the Ecuadorean government have for facilitating secret unrecorded visits by Paul Manafort ? ,0
Furthermore it is impossible that the intelligence agency – who were in charge of the security – would not know the identity of these alleged “ Russians ” ,1
Previously Harding and the Guardian have published documents faked by the Moreno government regarding a diplomatic appointment to Russia for Assange of which he had no knowledge ,1
Now they follow this up with more documents aimed to provide fictitious evidence to bolster Mueller ’s pathetically failed attempt to substantiate the story that Russia deprived Hillary of the Presidency ,1
"My friend William Binney , probably the world ’s greatest expert on electronic surveillance , former Technical Director of the NSA , has stated that it is impossible the DNC servers were hacked , the technical evidence shows it was a download to a directly connected memory stick ",1
"I knew the US security services were conducting a fake investigation the moment it became clear that the FBI did not even themselves look at the DNC servers , instead accepting a report from the Clinton linked DNC “ security consultants ” Crowdstrike ",1
I would love to believe that the fact Julian has never met Manafort is bound to be established ,0
But I fear that state control of propaganda may be such that this massive “ Big Lie ” will come to enter public consciousness in the same way as the non - existent Russian hack of the DNC servers ,1
Assange never met Manafort ,1
The DNC emails were downloaded by an insider ,1
Assange never even considered fleeing to Russia ,1
"Those are the facts , and I am in a position to give you a personal assurance of them ",1
"I can also assure you that Luke Harding , the Guardian , Washington Post and New York Times have been publishing a stream of deliberate lies , in collusion with the security services ",1
I am not a fan of Donald Trump ,0
"But to see the partisans of the defeated candidate ( and a particularly obnoxious defeated candidate ) manipulate the security services and the media to create an entirely false public perception , in order to attempt to overturn the result of the US Presidential election , is the most astonishing thing I have witnessed in my lifetime ",1
"Plainly the government of Ecuador is releasing lies about Assange to curry favour with the security establishment of the USA and UK , and to damage Assange ’s support prior to expelling him from the Embassy ",1
He will then be extradited from London to the USA on charges of espionage ,1
"Assange is not a whistleblower or a spy – he is the greatest publisher of his age , and has done more to bring the crimes of governments to light than the mainstream media will ever be motivated to achieve ",1
"That supposedly great newspaper titles like the Guardian , New York Times and Washington Post are involved in the spreading of lies to damage Assange , and are seeking his imprisonment for publishing state secrets , is clear evidence that the idea of the “ liberal media ” no longer exists in the new plutocratic age ",1
"The press are not on the side of the people , they are an instrument of elite control ",1
New Audio From The Night Of The Las Vegas Massacre Reveals That There Was “ Another Active Shooter ” In The Bar At The Top Of The Mandalay Bay Hotel During The Attack ,0
"Newly released audio from the Clark County Fire Department has provided even more proof that there were multiple shooters during The Las Vegas Massacre , further debunking the official narrative of a lone gunman on the 32nd floor and once again calling into question almost every aspect of what actually happened during the worst mass shooting in American history ",0
"The audio , released on the SoundCloud account of a local news reporter , is an almost three hour recording of transmissions between dispatch and units on the ground amid the confusion of the mass shooting that at one point details a report that a wife of a firefighter was actually pinned down in the Foundation Room bar on top of the Mandalay Hotel ",0
"Intellihub ’s Shepard Ambellas , who has extensively reported on the entire Vegas cover - up since the beginning , recently found that at around the 1:27:54 mark of the audio file you can clearly hear dispatch describing the situation to first responders who are headed in that direction ",0
“ We have a firefighter ’s wife at this event who is pinned down behind the bar at Mandalay Bay ,0
"We are trying to get further on the name , ” dispatch frantically notes ",0
"“ Batallion 6 , be advised that we are getting reports on Mandalay Bay , at the bar , we currently have , another active shooter up there ",0
” ,0
"After being asked to confirm the information , dispatch goes on to make clear that she is specifically speaking about the bar at the top of the hotel rather than anywhere near the 32nd floor room that Stephen Paddock supposedly operated from ",0
"“ The only information I have is it ’s the bar on top of the Mandalay Bay , ” dispatch continues before being asked if the shooter was pinned down or “ just sheltering right now ? ” ",0
"Interestingly , the story does n’t end there , as Ambellas wrote in his piece , author and entrepreneur Grant Cardone was actually holding an investors meeting in the very same bar shortly before the attack took place ",0
The popular social media influencer apparently left the Foundation Room literally seven minutes before authorities claim Paddock opened fire from his 32nd floor room ,0
"Cardone wrote about his experience in a post on Medium in which he claimed that the Mandalay Bay was telling visitors that there was at least one active shooter , “ moving ” throughout the hotel shooting people ",0
It was reported by the Mandalay there was a shooter moving through the hotel ,0
"I told Elena and Johnny , “ stay close to me , we are not running out , stay calm , there is one person in charge — where I go , you follow , no matter what ",0
"” [ … ] About this time , there was starting to be a lot more activity through the casino and now the reports suggested there was active multiple terrorists moving through the hotel shooting guest ",0
"Then twitter started showing up with feeds suggesting multiple hotels being attacked , bomb threats , and more ",0
"This new report documenting yet another instance of a possible second shooter comes on the heels of dozens of similar reports , with the most recent arriving in the form of air traffic control audio that directly stated that there were active shooters on the runway ",0
"“ During the air traffic control recordings , which were released by political strategist and co - founder of “ The New Right ” Mike Tokes , one of the dispatchers is heard telling an incoming plane that landing might not be a good idea because there were multiple active shooters on the airport property itself , ” SHTFplan reported ",0
"“ Shutting down might not be a good idea , there ’s active shooters on the runway , ” he declared ",0
"“ The 19s are closed , we are in the process of trying to round them up , they are on the airport property ",0

Slowly but surely we are beginning to see the truth about the horrific attack come to light despite authorities desperately trying to prevent it from reaching the American people ,1
"Sadly , the picture emerging is one that includes a shocking amount of evidence pointing towards a classic deep state false flag operation ",1
"Farrakhan Speech : ' Jews Are My Enemy , ' ' White Folks Are Going Down ' ",1
"With the leftist media entirely focused on the push to ban AR-15s and repeal the Second Amendment , practically no one noticed Louis Farrakhan 's Saviours’ Day 2018 Address in which he told an approving audience that """""""" powerful Jews are my enemy , """""""" and """""""" white folks are going down , """""""" according to The Washington Examiner ",1
"Farrakhan , of course , is the raging anti - Semite and race - monger who leads the Nation of Islam , the loony , militant , black nationalist organization whose mission is to throw off the yoke of the inferior white devil ",1

” His Twitter thread begins here : ,1
"Somehow the openly racist and anti - Semitic Farrakhan and his hateful organization have managed for decades to avoid being harshly denounced as such by the news media , which instead has spent the last two years attempting to smear Donald Trump as the new Hitler ",1

“ It ’s got ta be a set - up ” : Neighbor of Las Vegas Shooter Claims He Did n’t Do It ,1
This report was originally published by Paul Joseph Watson at Infowars.com ,0
A caller to the Michael Savage radio show who says he was neighbors with Las Vegas gunman Stephen Paddock asserts that Paddock could not have carried out the massacre and that it was actually a “ set - up ” ,1
"The man , a former Marine who called himself Rick , says he was Paddock ’s neighbor between December 2015 and June 2016 in Mesquite , Nevada ",0
"“ I can tell you 100 % this is not that kind of guy , ” said Rick , adding that he would see Paddock every other day and that the two would go to a local bar and play slot machines ",1
"“ He never even told me that he owned a gun , ” continued the shooter ’s neighbor , adding that Paddock did not express any religious or political opinions during their conversations ",0
"“ I ’m not a big conspiracy theory guy , but it do n’t sit right , ” said Rick , before making the extraordinary claim that the whole shooting was a “ set up ” and that Paddock ’s body may have been left in the hotel room while other assailants carried out the shooting ",1
"The caller mentioned how some people in the crowd were warned 45 minutes before the shooting that they were going to die , suggesting that this was evidence of a wider plot and not a “ lone wolf ” attack ",0
"As a firearms expert , he also questioned the lack of flashes coming from the hotel windows where the shooter was supposedly firing from ",0
Rick said he had already contacted the Clark County Sheriff ’s Office to relay all the information he knew ,0
"Although the claims are intriguing , it is important to remember that after virtually every terror attack and mass shooting , friends and neighbors express shock that the culprit would be capable of carrying out such horrors , with some outright denying it to be possible ",1
"If Paddock was planning such a sophisticated operation and hoping to evade detection , he would not be blabbing details about it to his neighbors ",0
"However , the neighbor ’s claims are certain to attract more attention given that no specific motive has yet to be uncovered for the shooting ",0

"UK Bans Free Speech Activists While Admitting Numerous Preachers Of Jihad Violence , Hatred & Sharia ",1
"The banning of free speech activists Martin Sellner and Brittany Pettibone from the UK is just the latest of many , many examples of how the British government bans foes of jihad terror while admitting its proponents ",1

NASA has released a record - breaking photograph taken by the New Horizons spacecraft when it was 3.79 billion miles away from the Earth ,1
"New Horizons flew past Pluto in July 2015 , taking pictures which revealed an even more diverse landscape than scientists had previously imagined ",0
"After the fly - by , the spacecraft continued into the Kuiper Belt - similar to the asteroid belt but further out from the Sun and composed of dwarf planets and frozen ice , rather than rocky bodies ",0
"Now , using its Long Range Reconnaissance Imager ( LORRI ) , the spacecraft has photographed several Kuiper Belt objects ( KBOs ) and dwarf planets at unique angles ",0

"The false - colour images released by NASA are the farthest from Earth ever captured by a spacecraft , and are also the closest - ever images of Kuiper Belt objects ",0
New Horizons was even further away from Earth than the Voyager 1 space probe when it turned towards the Earth on 14 February 1990 and took a picture of a tiny dot ,0
"In 1994 , US astronomer Carl Sagan reflected on the significance of the photograph to an audience at Cornell University , famously coining its name as the """""""" Pale Blue Dot """""""" , and giving one of the most widely published speeches of all time ",1

"The FBI arrested Imran , the eldest of the three Awan brothers , at Dulles Airport trying to fly to Pakistan in July , and prosecutors charged him with fraudulently gathering money the prior winter to wire overseas , possibly in an attempt to flee the investigation into the family ’s activities involving House computers ",0
"“ Based on the suspicious timing of that transaction , Awan and [ wife Hina ] Alvi likely knew they were under investigation at that time ” and “ there are strong indications of flight in this case , ” prosecutors wrote ",0
Abid was making his own efforts to round up money at the same time via the life insurance policy ,0
"On Nov. 16 , 2016 , the brothers made a video of his bedridden father signing over ownership — but not changing the beneficiary — of his life insurance policy to Abid ",1
Abid then used those rights to replace Gilani with himself as beneficiary ,0
"When his father died on Jan. 16 , 2017 , the youngest Awan brother , Jamal , attested on the death certificate provided to the insurance company that his father was divorced , a statement Gilani ’s lawyer said would have kept her from the money ",0
A Virginia court later ruled that Jamal ’s statement about his marital status on the certificate was wrong ,0
“ Why is that even relevant ? ” Bacon said of Jamal ’s misstatement at the March 7 court date ,1
"On Dec. 12 , 2016 , Imran and Alvi – who was also on the House payroll – began taking a series of withdrawals from banks , some of which federal prosecutors say occurred under fraudulent pretenses ",0

"Imran wired nearly $ 300,000 to Pakistan Jan. 18 , according to the indictment ",0
"On Jan. 17 , Abid filed notarized papers using those rights to replace Gilani with himself as beneficiary ",0
The life insurance change ’s timing seems to coincide with other moves by Abid to liquidate property and transfer it ,0
"Ten weeks prior , on Nov. 1 , 2016 , Alvi sold a house to Jamal for $ 620,000 , netting another significant profit from the mortgage company ",0
"In addition to his primary residence , Abid owned the house where his mother and stepfather lived , and moved in after his death , with Gilani becoming homeless ",0
Abid owned two homes despite a $ 1 million 2012 bankruptcy that might ordinarily have forced him to sell the second home to pay creditors ,0

"Gilani told TheDCNF the brothers were trying to use the life insurance policy as leverage to persuade her to sign a power of attorney giving them access to “ assets of my late husband in Pakistan , ” which were much more valuable than the $ 50,000 policy ",0
"Americo , the life insurance company , said there was “ great doubt ” about who the rightful policy holder was , given the allegations of fraud , and sent the decision to the courts to sort out on April 14 , two months after the House sargent - at - arms banned the Awans for “ suspicious activity ",1

"Gilani alleged the brothers took her financial documents , a laptop , and her husband ’s possessions ",0
"The only lawyer she could afford , she claimed , was Michael Hadeed , a business attorney who was convicted in 2010 of conspiracy and immigration fraud for helping aliens obtain green cards by setting them up with fake employment relationships ",0
"He lost his bar license for two years , according to Virginia State Bar documents ",0
"Hadeed did not introduce any evidence to the judge about a pattern of possible fraud by Abid , the timing of the move as it relates to the federal criminal case , or the mental capacity of the dying man to understand paperwork ",1
Hadeed withdrew earlier allegations of fraud and asked the judge to try the case based solely on interpretation of contract language ,0

Judge : I do n’t understand why the witness is having such trouble with the question ,1
Your job is to answer the question ,0
"In court documents , Gilani alleged , “ while he was admitted in hospital my telephone conversations were taped and some other recording devices were also installed / planted in my house … Imran Awan showed up and threatened me for me calling the police ",0
[ Imran ] threatened that he is very powerful and if I ever call the police again [ he ] will do harm to me ,1
” She said that Imran eventually agreed to remove the listening devices and did so in front of her ,0

"After Gilani retained a lawyer , Bacon had offered a settlement where they ’d split the money , but Gilani declined it ",0
"The court awarded Abid the $ 50,000 life insurance payout , minus $ 5,000 that the insurance company took for its expenses in litigating the fraud allegations ",0
“ You should have taken the settlement ,0

Google colluded with Clinton campaign with ‘ silent donations’ ,1
"While the establishment continues to push the notion that a couple hundred thousand dollars of ad spends and some Russian bots on Facebook swayed the election to Donald Trump , more proof of real “ collusion ” between Google and the Hillary Clinton campaign has been uncovered ",1
And Google likely violated federal election laws — not to mention the privacy of its users — in the services it provided the Clinton campaign ,0
Fox News’ Tucker Carlson read an internal email on Monday night ’s show that outlined in a Google’ executive ’s own words how the company was providing a “ silent donation ” to a group that was creating ads and donating funds to bus Latinos to voting stations in key swing states ,1

The assistance Google provided to the Clinton campaign likely violated election laws and served as an unreported in - kind contribution ,0

WikiLeaks’ Julian Assange revealed two years ago that Google CEO Eric Schmidt and a number of Google employees created a company in 2015 specifically to place Clinton the White House ,0

India Joins U.S. and China With Plans to Visit the Moon ,0
"So far , no one has ever managed to land on the far side of the moon , or near its shadowy poles ",0
"India wants to tackle both those firsts in one fell swoop this year , with its Chandrayaan-2 mission , a trio of orbiter , lander and rover that would represent the country 's second visit to the moon ",1
"The mission is scheduled to launch sometime in the first half of this year , no earlier than March ",0
"Its target is a patch of lunar surface about 370 miles away from the south pole , where scientists think the rock may be 4 billion years old , formed just after the moon 's giant ocean of liquid rock began to solidify ",0
"The region is an area NASA would also like to visit , preferably with a robot that would bring souvenir rock home to Earth for scientists to analyze directly in the laboratory ",0
"But despite NASA 's renewed focus on lunar exploration , as dictated in December by an order from President Trump , the agency wo n't beat India back to the moon ",0

That 's even after India 's Chandrayaan-2 mission was delayed by three years after Russia backed out of designing and producing the mission 's lander ,0
"Rather than lose out on that part of the mission , the Indian Space Research Organization decided to just do it themselves ",0
"But they are n't sure how long they can expect the mission to last once the lander and rover arrive — it could be over in as little as two weeks , ending as soon as the sun sets , since the mission runs on solar power and the polar area is quite shadowy even during the day ",0
"During that time , the team hopes to gather data about charged particles around the moon and the small """""""" moonquakes """""""" that ripple through its surface ",0

"The new mission 's predecessor , Chandrayaan-1 , was an orbiter that found the first evidence that there was water ice on the moon ",0
"Now , scientists know that ice is likely concentrated at the poles , where it could become an important resource for human and robotic explorers alike ",0
The orbiter piece of the upcoming mission will look to build on its predecessor by mapping how water actually moves around the moon ,0

Travis Air Force Base terrorist identified as Muslim Hafiz Kazi ,0
Earlier today I wrote : “ FBI spokeswoman Gina Swankie and Travis spokesman Airman Christian Conrad declined to elaborate on the matter or identify the driver ,0
Why ? ” ,0
Now it ’s clear why ,0
"They wanted to hold off as long as possible on identifying this terrorist as another Muslim , and this as another jihad terror attack ",1
"Protecting the image of Islam , not protecting the public , still seems to be the most important priority for all too many American officials ",1
"“ Man whose vehicle exploded at Travis AFB identified , ” KGO , March 23 , 2018 : ",0
"TRAVIS AIR FORCE BASE , Calif. ( KGO ) — A man who drove into Travis AFB has been identified as 51-year - old Hafiz Kazi , two sources with knowledge of the probe tell ABC News ",0
"The sources described Kazi as a “ nomad ” and a “ vagabond , ” who lived in many places ",1
Authorities extracted a video from his cell phone and are analyzing it to try and see if it could help point to a motive ,0
Sources would n’t offer any details about the video ,0
The FBI is holding a press conference Friday at 3:30 p.m. and will be asking the public for help and any information about Kazi ,0

Anti - Gay Imam Featured Yet Again at Florida Democrat Gala ,1
"The Democratic Party promotes itself as an advocacy group for all matters concerning homosexuals and labels politicians , who take stances opposite theirs on politically charged issues such as same - sex marriage , as bigots ",0
"Yet , the party keeps on inviting an imam , who has a long record of hostility toward homosexuals , to participate at its annual functions ",0
This blatant hypocrisy shows the political bankruptcy of their leadership ’s claims to be pro - gay and anti - bigotry and reveals their intention to pander to those in the Muslim community who spew intolerance and would wish others harm ,1
"On Saturday , October 7 , 2017 , the Palm Beach Democratic Party held its 2017 Truman Kennedy Johnson ( TKJ ) Dinner at the West Palm Beach Marriott Hotel , in West Palm Beach , Florida ",0
The Keynote Speaker at the event was Governor of Virginia Terry McAuliffe ,0
"Other speakers included : United States Representative Alcee Hastings ; then - Florida Democratic Party Chairman Stephen Bittel , who resigned in November over allegations of sexually inappropriate behavior ; and then - Palm Beach County Party Chairwoman Terrie Rizzo , who was elected in December to take over for Bittel as Chair of the Florida Democratic Party ",0
"Prior to the speakers , there was a joint invocation performed by a rabbi , two pastors and an imam ",0
"The imam , Maulana Shafayat Mohamed , is notorious for his unapologetic vilification of homosexuals ",0
"Shafayat Mohamed is the imam of the Darul Uloom Institute , located in Pembroke Pines , Florida ",0
The mosque has been a haven for terror - related individuals and activity ,0
“ Dirty Bomber ” Jose Padilla was a student of Shafayat Mohamed ’s at Darul Uloom ,1
"Now - deceased al - Qaeda Global Operations Chief , Adnan el - Shukrijumah , was a prayer leader at Darul Uloom ",0
"And Darul Uloom Arabic teacher Imran Mandhai , along with mosque goers Hakki Aksoy and Shueyb Mossa Jokhan , hatched a plot at the mosque to blow up different South Florida structures , including area power stations , Jewish businesses , and a National Guard armory ",0
While terrorism plays a huge role in his mosque ’s history – and he has been around for all of it – Shafayat Mohamed ’s personal history deals much more in bigotry than terror ,0
One stop on Shafayat Mohamed ’s Facebook page and one can view his profile photo of him holding a dark green book with gold border and letters on the cover ,0
"The book is “ The Meaning of THE HOLY QUR’AN , ” a version of the Quran that was banned by the Los Angeles public school system , in February 2002 , for containing numerous anti - Semitic commentaries ",0
"In it , Jews are described as : “ arrogant , ” “ jealous , ” “ selfish , ” “ spiteful , ” “ greedy , ” “ cursed , ” “ apes and swine , ” and “ under divine displeasure ",1
” ,0
"This may seem an innocent mistake on the imam ’s part , but his actions against the gay community and sinister views are anything but ",1
"In February 2005 , an article written by Shafayat Mohamed was published on the Darul Uloom website , entitled ‘ Tsunami : Wrath of God.’ In it , he claims that gay sex caused the 2004 Indonesian tsunami and that most Jews and Christians , whom he refers to as “ People of the Book , ” are “ perverted transgressors ",1
” ,0
It is writings such as these that have gotten Shafayat Mohamed thrown off a number of Broward County boards ,0
"Even so , the imam has been unrepentant ",0
"In a speech he gave at Darul Uloom , in August 2015 , titled ‘ Quraan Torah Bible Forbid Man Marrying Man,’ he admitted that he “ got sacked from many [ county ] boards , because there were a lot of gay people who said , ‘ We do n’t want him on that board.’ ” He said he had a choice , to “ sit in Paradise or … sit on the board and go to Hell ",0
” ,0
He began his speech by attacking President Barack Obama for supporting same - sex marriage ,0
"He asked the following , “ Did you hear what President Obama said ? … Do you know what a sad situation we are in this country ? ... ",0
Here you have the President of the United States of America saying that a man could marry a man ? … Are we sleeping ? ,0
Do you believe in the Quran ? ,0
"Are we gon na sit and have the Quran be ridiculed ? ” He then cited the Christian and Jewish Bible , barking loudly , “ The Bible says that if a man sleeps with a man , he should be killed ! ” ",1
Shafayat Mohamed later lamented the existence of Muslim homosexuals ,0
"He decried , “ Listen ",0
Do n’t deny it ,0
They already got Muslim gay communities ,0
"” He as well spoke of his support for polygamy , an act that is illegal in the United States ",0
"He exclaimed , “ Here the President says a man can marry a man , but you ca n’t say a man can have four wives … ! ” ",0
The October TKJ Dinner was not the first Democrat event Shafayat Mohamed has participated in ,0
"In fact , he has been involved in many , including giving the invocations at the Florida Democratic Party ’s annual Leadership Blue Gala in 2014 ( featuring Bill Clinton ) , 2015 and 2016 ",0
"And given that this author has written about this before , the October event will probably not be the last occasion that he is embraced by the Democratic Party ",0
Shafayat Mohamed is not the only Muslim extremist that has participated in the Democratic Party ’s TKJ Dinner ,0
"In October 2015 , the dinner invocation was performed by Wilfredo Amr Ruiz , the legal adviser of the American Muslim Association of North America ( AMANA ) , a group that actively promotes former KKK leader and white supremacist David Duke ",1
"Ruiz , as well , founded AMANA ’s Connecticut and Puerto Rico chapters ",0
"In July 2010 , the Anti - Defamation League ( ADL ) condemned Ruiz ’s AMANA for posting what the ADL called a “ venomous ” anti - Semitic Duke video onto the group ’s official website ",1
"AMANA is currently promoting another anti - Semitic Duke - produced video , on the AMANA site ",0
"The President of AMANA , Sofian Zakkout , has referred to Duke as “ David Duke , a man to believe in ! ” ",1
"By inviting people like Shafayat Mohamed , an avowed enemy of the gay community , and Wilfredo Ruiz , whose group promotes white supremacists , to participate in its functions , the Democratic Party has effectively revealed its disregard for the concerns of those it disingenuously claims to advocate for and protect ",0
It is time for Democrats to reject the bigotry of these radicals and see them for the liability they present ,0
Failure to do so exposes the party ’s liberal agenda as a sham ,1

The Pope Is Now Openly Attacking Child Sexual Abuse Victims For “ Slander ” ,0
Pope Francis is now attacking the credibility of child sex abuse victims in a shocking move made at the end of a trip to Chile in which he had hoped to “ heal ” the wounds of said abuse ,1
"That ’s right , Pope Francis ended his trip by publicly defending a bishop who victims have accused of covering up widespread pedophilia in the country ",0
"According to a report by the Associated Press , Francis made the shocking comments in a discussion about Rev. ",1
Fernando Karadima who has been found guilty of sexually abusing a slew of minors as a member of the Catholic Church ,0
"Pope Francis accused victims of Chile ’s most notorious pedophile of slander Thursday , an astonishing end to a visit meant to help heal the wounds of a sex abuse scandal that has cost the Catholic Church its credibility in the country ",0
Francis said that until he sees proof that Bishop Juan Barros was complicit in covering up the sex crimes of the Rev. ,0
"Fernando Karadima , such accusations against Barros are “ all calumny ",1
” The pope ’s remarks drew shock from Chileans and immediate rebuke from victims and their advocates ,1
They noted the accusers were deemed credible enough by the Vatican that it sentenced Karadima to a lifetime of “ penance and prayer ” for his crimes in 2011 ,0
"A Chilean judge also found the victims to be credible , saying that while she had to drop criminal charges against Karadima because too much time had passed , proof of his crimes was n’t lacking ",0
[ … ] The Karadima scandal dominated Francis’ visit to Chile and the overall issue of sex abuse and church cover - up was likely to factor into his three - day trip to Peru that began late Thursday ,0
"Karadima ’s victims reported to church authorities as early as 2002 that he would kiss and fondle them in the swank Santiago parish he ran , but officials refused to believe them ",1
Only when the victims went public with their accusations in 2010 did the Vatican launch an investigation that led to Karadima being removed from ministry ,0
The emeritus archbishop of Santiago subsequently apologized for having refused to believe the victims from the start ,0
One of the victims made clear his disgust at Pope Francis for essentially covering up for a man who watched as another bishop sexually abused him ,0
"“ As if I could have taken a selfie or a photo while Karadima abused me and others and Juan Barros stood by watching it all , ” tweeted Juan Carlos Cruz ",0
"“ These people are truly crazy , and the pontiff talks about atonement to the victims ",1
"Nothing has changed , and his plea for forgiveness is empty ",0
” ,0
This obviously does not look good for the Pope or the Catholic Church as they are now apparently engaging in attacking the victims instead of actually going after the abusers ,0
Jeff Sessions lashes back at Trump ,1

"WASHINGTON — Attorney General Jeff Sessions has a message for Donald Trump : You ’re wrong , Mr. President ",1
"Sessions long has been one of Trump ’s favorite pinatas , often taking the brunt of the president ’s public scorn ",1
Trump offered this assessment of his hand - picked attorney general recusing himself from the Justice Department ’s special counsel probe of Russian election meddling : “ What kind of man is this ? ” ,1
"Trump , in an interview that aired Thursday morning , also blasted Sessions because , he said , the former Alabama senator “ never took control of the Justice Department ",1

"About seven hours later , the country ’s top law enforcement officer fired back ",1
"And , by doing so , took on Trump publicly in a way few Republicans in Washington have during his turbulent 19-month - old presidency ",0

"“ While I am Attorney General , the actions of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations ",0
"I demand the highest standards , and where they are not met , I take action , ” Sessions added ",0

"Trump did not directly answer a Fox News interviewer ’s question about whether he intends to fire Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein , who is overseeing the special counsel investigation , after November ’s congressional elections ",0

"That was around the time that the Assassination Records Review Board , which was overseeing the mandatory release of JFK - related assassination records of the CIA and other federal agencies that had been kept secret from the American people since 1963 ",1
"Today , Americans can read the CIA ’s assassination manual online ",0
"Titled “ Study of Assassination , ” the manual spells out various ways to assassinate people ",0
Here is what the manual states in part regarding the use of firearms : ,0
"Firearms are often used in assassination , often very ineffectively … ",0
Public figures or guarded officials may be killed with great reliability and some safety if a firing point can be established prior to an official occasion ,0
The propaganda value of this system may be very high ,0
Time to buy old US gold coins ,0
The manual also makes it clear that the CIA was studying ways to assassinate people without being detected ,0
Note the following excerpt : ,0
"For secret assassination , either simple or chase , the contrived accident is the most effective technique ",0
"When successfully executed , it causes little excitement and is only casually investigated ",0
It would be safe to assume that the CIA continued developing and expanding on the assassination principles enunciated in that early assassination manual ,0
That ’s what we would expect from an agency whose specialties included assassination ,0
We can also assume that the CIA continued to refine the ways to avoid detection when assassinating someone ,0

"The CIA published that secret assassination manual as part of its preparations for a U.S. regime - change operation in Guatemala , one that was designed to violently remove the nation ’s democratically elected socialist president , Jacobo Arbenz , from office and replace him with an unelected , right - wing , pro - U.S. military general ",1
"As part of the Guatemala regime - change operation , the CIA prepared a list of Guatemalan officials to be assassinated ",0
"While the CIA has never revealed the names of the people it targeted for assassination , there is little doubt that Arbenz , the president , was at the top of the list ",0
There is something important to note : Neither Arbenz nor any other Guatemalan official had ever attacked the United States or even threatened to do so ,0
"So , why were they targeted for assassination ? ",0
"Because Arbenz had reached out to the Russians and Cubans in a spirit of peace and friendship , just as John Kennedy would do ten years later ",0
That ’s why the CIA targeted Guatemala for regime change and why it targeted Arbenz and other Guatemalan officials for assassination ,0
"Although Arbenz was able to escape the country , the CIA ’s regime - change operation was a total success , with Arbenz being replaced by the pro - U.S. Gen. Carlos Castillo Armas , who proceeded to instigate a reign of terror across Guatemala ",1
The Guatemalan operation was brilliant and ingenious ,1
The CIA officials were secretly honored for protecting “ national security ” by removing President Arbenz from office and replacing him with a pro - U.S. military general ,0
"Tracy Barnes , one of the CIA officials responsible for the operation , was awarded the Distinguished Intelligence Medal , the CIA ’s second - highest medal ",0
The CIA ’s cover - up in the JFK assassination was even more brilliant and ingenious ,1
"The doctors at Parkland Hospital stated that President Kennedy had a big exit - sized wound in the back of his head , which implied a shot having been fired from the front ",0
"At a press conference immediately after the president died , two treating physicians stated that the other wound — the one in the front of Kennedy ’s neck — was an entry wound , which implied that Kennedy had been hit by another shot fired from the front ",0
"This necessarily meant that Kennedy had been shot from the front , not the rear , where accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald was situated ",0
"Keep in mind something important : After he was arrested , Oswald claimed his innocence ",0
But he also went a step further ,0
He said that he was being framed for the crime ,0
The obvious question arises : Why frame an innocent man who is situated in the rear by killing the president with shots fired from the front ? ,0
"Would n’t it be more logical to either have the shots fired from the rear , where Oswald was , or , alternatively , place Oswald in the front , where the shots were fired ? ",0
"That ’s where the brilliance , ingenuity , and cunningness of the cover - up come into play ",1
"If Oswald is in the rear and since shots are fired from the front , that could mean only one thing : that Oswald had confederates firing from the front ",0
Who would those confederates be ? ,0
There could be only one answer : communists ,1
"Soviet and Cuban communists , to be more specific ",1
How would we know this ? ,0
That ’s where Oswald ’s trip to Mexico City right before the assassination comes into play ,0
Regime Change : The JFK ... Jacob Hornberger Check Amazon for Pricing ,0
Oswald traveled to Mexico City where he purportedly visited the Soviet and Cuban embassies and where he supposedly met with a premier assassin for the Soviet Union ,0
"Keep in mind that this was the height of the Cold War between the United States and that the Cuban Missile Crisis , which brought the world to the brink of nuclear war , had taken place the previous year ",0
"So , President Kennedy has been assassinated ",0
Oswald is immediately arrested ,0
"He has confederates firing from the front , who almost certainly are Soviet and Cuban communists , especially since Oswald has supposedly just recently visited the Soviet and Cuban embassies in Mexico City ",1
What does all that mean ? ,0
An assassination of the president by the Soviet Union and Cuba is obviously an act of war ,0
That means nuclear war is about to break out because there is no way that the United States is going to sit idly by when the Reds have just assassinated America ’s president ,1
Except for one thing : The communist part and the nuclear - war part were concocted ,1
That was all part of the plan ,1
That was the ingenious way that the CIA was able to get the investigation into the assassination squelched just as soon as Oswald was murdered ,1
"In the early days of the Warren Commission , commission chairman Earl Warren called a top - secret meeting of the commission ",0
Its purpose was to discuss information that Warren had received that Oswald was actually a U.S. intelligence agent or an informant for the FBI or both ,0
How did Warren resolve this troubling issue ? ,0
He simply asked the heads of the CIA and FBI whether it was true ,0
They said no ,0
That was the end of the matter ,0
The issue was so sensitive that Warren ordered the members of the commission to never reveal the meeting to the American people ,1
He ordered all notes and other written references to be destroyed ,0
He also ordered the court reporter to destroy her notes of the meeting ,0
"Unbeknownst to him , the court reporter inadvertently kept a recording of the meeting that ultimately came to light ",0
"This troubling issue arose again yesterday , November 2 , in the Washington Post in an article entitled “ Tantalizing Mystery of JFK Assassination Files Solved – 23 Years Ago ",1
"” In the article , author Ian Shapira points out that among the long - secret CIA records that were recently released was a deposition of former CIA Director Richard Helms taken in 1975 before the President ’s Commission on CIA Activities , which stated as follows : ",0
"BELIN : Well , now , the final area of my interrogation relates to charges that the CIA was in some way conspiratorially involved with the assassination of President Kennedy ",0
"During the time of the Warren Commission , you were Deputy Director of Plans , is that correct ? ",0
HELMS : I believe so ,0
BELIN : Is there any information involved with the assassination of President Kennedy which in any way shows that Lee Harvey Oswald was in some way a CIA agent or an age[nt ,0
"… The CIA , Terrorism , an ... Jacob Hornberger Check Amazon for Pricing ",0
That ’s where the transcript ends according to few secret records of the CIA that were recently released by the National Archives ,0
"Shapira points out , “ Several news organizations , including The Washington Post , seized on the truncated file as an example of the government ’s continued secrecy about the assassination ",0
” Shapira points out that Helms’ full deposition has been in the public arena since 1994 ,0
"( The year 1994 was during the tenure of the Assassination Records Review Board , the agency charged with securing the mandated release of JFK assassination records from the CIA and other federal agencies ",0
"The ARRB Had been formed after Americans had learned of the official secrecy after watching Oliver Stone ’s movie JFK , which posited that the JFK assassination was a U.S. regime - change operation , no different in principle from the one the CIA had carried out in Guatemala nine years before ",0
) ,0
"Shapira then proceeds to provide the answer that Helms gave , which , as he points out , has been public : ",0
"HELMS : Mr. Belin , this question , and I think you may recall this , was raised at the time and the Agency was never able to find any evidence whatsoever , and we really searched that it had any contact with Lee Harvey Oswald ",0
"As far as the FBI was concerned , my recollection is not all that precise ",0
I believe that Mr. Hoover testified that he had not been an agent of theirs either ,0
He was certainly not an agent of the CIA ,0
He was certainly never used by the CIA ,0
Whether any CIA officer ever talked to him any place or not I do n’t know but I certainly felt quite comfortable — I believe Mr. [ John ] McCone [ a previous CIA director ] was asked to testify before the Commission on this point ,0
I believe he was asked to testify ,0
It was a hot item anyway at the time ,0
And my recollection is that I informed Mr. McCone that we could find no evidence that Oswald had any connection with the CIA ,0
"Shapira ends his article by suggesting that commentators should do more complete research , maybe even use Google , before they jump to conclusions ",1
But Shapira would be wise to follow his own advice because he himself is guilty of what he accuses others of ,1
That ’s because he failed to conclude his article with one great big important point about former CIA Director Richard Helms ,1
"What is that great big important point that Shapira , who , according to his tagline on his article , “ enjoys writing about people who have served in the military and intelligence communities , ” left out of his article ? ",1
Perjury ,0
He left out that former CIA Director Richard Helms was a perjurer ,1
A liar ,1
"A CIA official who would tell falsehoods , even under oath , whenever he felt that “ national security ” required it ",0
Shapira failed to note that Helms was convicted in a federal district court of lying to Congress under oath about another CIA regime - change operation ten years after the Kennedy assassination in Chile ,1
"Interesting enough , in the Chile regime - change operation , the CIA and the Pentagon were telling their counterparts in the Chilean national - security establishment that they had a moral duty to violate their nation ’s constitution and violently remove their nation ’s democratically elected president , Salvador Allende , from office ",1
The reason ? ,0
"Allende was reaching out to the Russians and Cubans in a spirit of peace and friendship , just as Arbenz had done and just as Kennedy had done ",0
JFKu2019s War with the ... Douglas Horne Check Amazon for Pricing ,0
"Thus , given that Helms was an admitted perjurer and convicted liar , what value does his denial that Oswald was an intelligence agent have ? ",1
It has no value at all ,0
"And Shapira , who “ enjoys writing about people who have served in the military and intelligence communities ” had an ethical duty to point out Helms’ proclivity for lying in his article ",1
The circumstantial evidence overwhelmingly establishes that Oswald was working for U.S. intelligence ,1
How often have you ever heard of a U.S. Marine communist ? ,0
"If Oswald was a genuine communist , why would he have joined the Marines in the 1950s , given that the Marines hated communists and had just helped kill millions of them in the Korean War ? ",0
"Why would a genuine communist want to join an organization in which he could be ordered , on a moment ’s notice , to return to Korea or be sent to Vietnam , Laos , China , the Soviet Union , or Europe to kill communists ? ",0
Do n’t forget : this is the height of the Cold War ! ,0
"After Oswald supposedly tried to “ defect ” to the Soviet Union and promised to give the Russians all the secrets he learned about in the military , why would U.S. officials agree to let him back in the country , and with a communist wife ? ",1
Why would n’t they indict him or at least haul him before a federal grand jury to testify as to what secrets he gave the Russians ? ,0
"Why would n’t they harass , abuse , humiliate , persecute , or prosecute him , like they did to Martin Luther King , Dalton Trumbo , John Walker Lindh , Chelsea Manning , Edward Snowden , and other people they have deemed to be communists or traitors ? ",1
How is it possible that Oswald could learn fluent Russian while serving in the U.S. military without having U.S. military tutors teaching him ? ,0
"How is it possible that a veteran who embarrasses the U.S. Marine Corps by openly proselytizing for communism in New Orleans is able to saunter across the Cold War stage of history , not long after the McCarthy hearings , without nary a care in the world ? ",1
The answer : Helms lied ,1
"There is no reasonable doubt that Oswald was a U.S. intelligence agent , one who was ordered to travel to Mexico City to set the framework for his frame - up ",1
"But things obviously went dreadfully wrong in Mexico City , which is why the CIA had to shut down that part of the post - assassination investigation ",1
"Not surprisingly , the CIA ’s Mexico City operations regarding Oswald are among the 98 percent of the records that Trump and the CIA have chosen to continue keeping secret from the American people , on grounds of “ national security ” of course ",1
"Thus , when Oswald was claiming that he was being framed , there could be only one entity that he could have been thinking about : the CIA , the agency whose officials , as former Washington Post investigative reporter Jefferson Morley has documented , were secretly monitoring his activities in the weeks leading up to the assassination , no doubt to ensure that Oswald had not figured out what was about to happen to him ",1
We can assume that any frame - up by the CIA is going to be good ,0
The operation is going to be carefully planned and executed ,0
But no plan is perfect ,1
Things are inevitably going to go wrong ,0
The pieces are n’t going to fit together perfectly ,0
The Mexico City operation is a good example of that ,0
That ’s why the CIA has to continue keeping those records secret ,1
"But here ’s another example , a small but important one : Recall that Oswald supposedly hid the rifle before he headed down the steps from the sixth floor of the school book depository ",0
"Ask yourself : If someone has just assassinated the president of the United States , is he really going to take the time to hide the rifle ? ",0
What good would that do ? ,0
Would n’t officials conduct a thorough search of the area ? ,0
Would n’t an assassin instead simply leave the rifle there and get out of there as soon as he could ? ,0
Then why the hidden rifle ? ,1
Because it ’s consistent with a frame - up ,1
The framers had to hide the rifle in advance in a place where no one CIA & JFK : The Secret ... Jefferson Morley Check Amazon for Pricing ,0
"would see it during the morning of the assassination , which took place after noon ",0
"No matter how good a frame - up was , the CIA knew that it could be detected with an aggressive investigation ",0
That ’s where ingenuity and cunning come into play ,1
They had to figure out a way to shut down the investigation so that the frame - up would remain intact ,0
That ’s why they had shots fired from the front and placed Oswald in the rear ,1
"The idea was that since an investigation would lead to Oswald ’s supposed communist confederates in the front , which in turn would lead to nuclear war , the investigation had to be shut down immediately , especially since it was the CIA itself that had started the assassination game by repeatedly attempting , in partnership with the Mafia , to assassinate Castro ",0
It was one of the most brilliant and cunning ruses in history ,1
"They get the body out of Parkland by force , in violation of Texas law , and put it in the hands of the military in Maryland , which conducts a secret fraudulent and bogus autopsy ",1
( See my book The Kennedy Autopsy ,1
) ,1
Lyndon Johnson telephones Dallas District Attorney Henry Wade on the night of the assassination and orders him to shut down any investigation of a conspiracy because it might lead to nuclear war ,1
"As soon as Oswald is assassinated , the FBI orders Wade to turn over all his investigative files to the FBI ",0
"At the same time , Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach and FBI Head J. Edgar Hoover both write secret memos and reports saying any further investigation must stop immediately ",0
Lyndon Johnson gets Earl Warren and Sen. Richard Russel to join the Warren Commission by telling them that the assassination could lead to World War III ,1
"Johnson appoints former CIA Director Allan Dulles , who Kennedy had fired as a result of the CIA ’s regime - change operation at the Bay of Pigs , to the Warren Commission , thereby guaranteeing that there will be no investigation of the CIA ",0
"Then keep all the records secret for decades , when many people wo n’t care anymore who killed President Kennedy ",0
And employ Operation Mockingbird - like journalistic assets in the private sector to flood the market with alternative “ conspiracy theories ” to confound and confuse the public ,0
And smear anyone who questions the official narrative as a “ communist sympathizer ” or a “ conspiracy theorist ,1
” ,1
The CIA ’s cunning cover - up in the JFK assassination worked brilliantly ,1
"Thanks to President Trump and the CIA ’s decision to continue keeping 98 percent of the CIA ’s decades - long secret records secret from the American people , the CIA ’s cunning cover - up of the JFK assassination continues to work brilliantly today ",1

There is probably nothing more inhospitable than homosexual gang rape ,1
But to say God completely destroyed two cities and all their inhabitants for being inhospitable clearly misses the point ,0
"While Sodom and Gomorrah were guilty of many other horrendous sins , homosexuality was the reason God poured fiery sulfur on the cities , completely destroying them and all of their inhabitants ",1
"To this day , the area where Sodom and Gomorrah were located remains a desolate wasteland ",0
"Sodom and Gomorrah serve as a powerful example of how God feels about sin in general , and homosexuality specifically ",1
The point is that there were no righteous to be spared and the Lord did what man failed to do when they had the time to do it ,1
Question : How do you show mercy to a people who observe lying vanities ( Jonah 2:4 ) and refuse to return to the Lord ( Jeremiah 6:16 ) on His terms ? ,1
( Jeremiah 22:3 ) God must be true and judgment must commence ,0
"Men today , like those of Sodom and Gomorrah , are not valiant for the truth ",0
They are valiant to proceed from evil to evil ( Jeremiah 5 ) ,0
"They care more about the pleasures of sin for a season , than they are grieved for the afflictions of Joseph ( Amos 6:6 ; Hebrews 11:25 ) ",0
Men today care more of compromise ( where two men both agree on what they both know is wrong ) and diplomacy ( seduction in another guise ) in promoting anarchy through “ antinomianism ” than they do the Law of God against the sins unto judgment that enslave men ( John 8:34 ) ,0
"Instead of establishing judgment within the gate and hating the evil and loving the good ( Amos 5:15 ) in hopes that the Lord may be gracious to their repentance ( 2 Corinthians 7:10 ) , they reject the counsel of God against them by hating the good and loving the evil , and that to their own damnation ",0
"They care more about the approbation and favor of men than they do that of the Living God and what His Word declares ( Galatians 1:10),not knowing that which his highly favored among men is an abomination unto the Lord ( Luke 16:15 ) ",1
They wear the cross ,0
"Yet , they have no testimony of the power of God unto salvation by the cross because they do not practice what Christ required : “ Deny yourselves and take up your cross and follow Me ” ( Matthew 16:24 ; Romans 1:16 ; 2 Corinthians 5:15 , 13:4 - 5 ; Galatians 2:21 ) ",0
"Professed Christians in America today talk much of love through inaction , and yet know nothing of it ( 1 John 3:18 ) ",1
"They read what to do , but do it not ! ",1
"In fact , they declare and proclaim how much they love God , and yet if you were to have them read His moral law and look to their own lives , they would find how much they actually hate God through their actions ( Matthew 15:8 ) ",1

"They continuously preach of the heroism of Abraham , Moses , Joshua , David , Gideon , Samson and others from the pulpit and fail to understand what these men were doing when serving their generations ( Psalm 71:18 - 19 ; Isaiah 51:4 ) ",0
"Today , instead of doing the same , they simply hide under a false grace ( Isaiah 30 ) and give themselves over to a man , the president , and declare end times ",0
They declare we 're in the end times because they have failed to stand up and fight for their posterity in keeping the Lord 's commandments and His judgments ( Psalm 78:1 - 11 ) ,0
"Ungrateful reprobates , pretenders , counterfeits and hypocrites are what they are ( Matthew 23:3 ) ",1
"Instead of reaching out to the greatest demographic here in America , public high schools , they send missionaries to foreign lands to do there what they fail to do for their own here ",1
"Instead of fighting for their posterity and shutting down the illegalities of sodomy in all 50 states , they teach them to just do their best to understand that they can not help themselves while God say ’s the opposite ( Leviticus 20:18 ) ",1
"Instead of fighting on their behalf against the federal government that is illegally indoctrinating them , they simply give their kids over to them to be dumbed down ",1
"And instead of protesting the murder of 58 million innocent babies ( Proverbs 6:17 ) , they merely pass it off as a """""""" choice , """""""" that being the lessons that they learned from the media that they say that they do not believe ( Romans 1:18 ) ",1
"The American Church , instead of protesting corruption in government through the example of the Biblical patriarchs and our American forefathers ( Matthew 5:17 - 18 ) , teach to submit to tyranny as if to suggest that it is somehow obedience to God ( Romans 12:21 ) ",1
The Church in America has failed to keep the Commandments of the God of Israel ,1
"Instead of preaching out against sin , they advocate for that which God clearly condemns , thereby making war against God ( Micah 3:5 ) , which at length destroys our government , our country and our families ",1
Look to their feigned strength that they profess to possess ,1
It is gauged by simply looking to the prevailing immoralities and debauchers of society ,1
They are weak and pathetic and they have no excuses as to why America is where we is today ! ,1
Why did God judge Sodom and Gomorrah ? ,0
"It 's the same reason that he is judging America today ( Amos 4:12 ) , He can not find the righteous in order to spare her ( Jeremiah 22:3 ) ",1
Defining the Wicked … ,1
"Wicked men in the sight of God are those who have the knowledge of what to do when it comes to the right , but over and over again , they turn their shoulders and choose the wrong , through tolerance and apathy Americans are bringing upon themselves destruction ( Deuteronomy 30:19 ) that will not be reversed , which leaves no alternative as to why God judges and is judging America today ( Deuteronomy 28:63 ) ",1

"NewsCatholic Church , Homosexuality ",0
"AUSTRIA , February 16 , 2018 ( LifeSiteNews ) – The Diocese of Linz , Austria , invited homosexual couples to participate in the blessing of couples on St. Valentine 's Day ",0
"The move comes in the wake of the recent debate over the German bishops ' initiative to bless homosexual couples , as well as the controversy over Bishop Andreas Laun 's own criticism of it ",0
"The diocese ’s own media report makes a reference to Amoris Laetitia , as well as to Cardinal Reinhard Marx 's recent initiative ",0
"The official diocesan newspaper , KirchenZeitung , announced on February 9 that in two different parishes in the Diocese of Linz homosexual couples were explicitly invited to receive a Church blessing on St. Valentine 's Day ",0
As is explained in the article : ,0
St. Valentine is known as the saint of friendship and of love ,0
"In many parishes and ecclesial institutions , it is already tradition to offer blessings of couples around the time of his feast day ",0
People in homosexual relationships are welcome at the blessing ceremonies in Wels - St ,0
Franziskus [ Church ] and in the Ursulinenkirche ,0
"Paul Stütz , the author of the article , explains that the blessing of couples “ offers an occasion to express love ",0
” ,0
“ The blessing expresses that one is welcomed by one 's partner and by God ,0
"” At the end of his article , he adds a link to another report about Cardinal Reinhard Marx 's recent 3 February interview showing his openness to the idea of blessings of homosexual couples in individual cases as decided by a pastor ",0
"Stütz also quotes in the article itself Father Franz Harant , “ a pastoral worker in the field of marriage and the family ” at the Ursulinenkirche in Linz ",1
"Harant himself shows himself a supporter of blessings for homosexual couples , and he makes here an explicit reference to Amoris Laetitia ",1
As Stütz reports : ,0
We give out that universally available blessing ,0
"There , we have nothing to forbid , ” says Harant ",0
"He sees himself in this in union with Pope Francis who himself says in his magisterial document Amoris Laetitia that “ each person , independent of his sexual orientation , is to be respected in his dignity and welcomed with respect ",1
"As the Austrian Catholic website Kath.net writes , Harant must be quoting here AL 250 ",0
"Irmgard Lehner , the pastoral assistant of the Wels - St ",0
"Franziskus Church , the other of the two parishes that welcome homosexual couples , appreciates this blessing ritual for Valentine 's Day , saying it has “ an enormous power ",1
"” During the ceremony , couples come forward in church and receive a hand on their foreheads and a sign of the cross ",1
"“ We thus stress the high value of relationships , ” explains Lehner ",0
As the KirchenZeitung journalist adds : “ This offer can be accepted by lovers in all kinds of life situations – also by lesbians and homosexuals ,0
"” Lehner , who is herself a theologian , regrets that , so far , no homosexual couple has come for the blessing ",0
"“ Here with us , everybody should feel welcome , just as he or she is ",0
” The pastoral assistant adds that “ God is love ,0
There are no restrictions ,0
” ,0
The Diocesan Working Group on Pastoral Care for Homosexuals ( dahop ) is rejoicing about such a welcome from a parish ,0
The group says that it repeatedly receives requests from homosexual couples who wish to “ receive a blessing in the frame of a liturgy ,0
” ,0
"The KirchenZeitung then quotes a commentary , saying : ",0
"It would be good if a clear sign of openness and invitation would be made by many more pastoral workers [ male and female ] , in order to give the clear signal that love between two persons with equal rights are wished by God and thus already blessed ",0
"Moreover , the above - quoted Franz Harant himself is the contact person of this Diocesan Working Group – also called “ Rainbow Pastoral ",0
"” As can be seen on the website of dahop , the Diocese of Linz offers special liturgical services for homosexuals , called “ Queer Church Services ” ( Queer - Gottesdienste ) that take place in Harant 's own parish ",0
It is not clear whether these church services take place in a form of a Holy Mass. ,0
"Similar blessings for homosexual couples are currently taking place , or are being considered , also in Gemany , some of them on the diocesan level , some of them on an individual level ",0
"As LifeSiteNews reported in January , the Diocese of Limburg is publicly discussing the establishment of a special liturgical rite for the blessing of homosexuals ",0
"Publicly presented by Johannes zu Eltz , a high - ranking priest of the diocese , his so - called Frankfurt proposal has the public support of the local bishop , Georg Bätzing ",0
"Additionally , the Austrian Catholic website Kath.net reports that there are two Catholics priests in two different German dioceses who publicly state now to have given many blessings to homosexual couples ",0
Father Christoph Simonsen ( Diocese of Aachen ) says that he has blessed 50 couples in the last fifteen years ; Father Siegfried Modenbach ( Archdiocese of Paderborn ) has blessed two homosexual couples in the last years ,0
He also conducts church services for homosexuals ,0
Kath.net subsequently contacted both Dioceses and requested information about these two priests ,0
"As an answer , they were told that the Diocese intends to talk with the concerned priests , but that this matter needs to be addressed among the German bishops in general , such as in the German Bishops ' Conference ",0
This moral turmoil in German dioceses has provoked concern and criticism among Catholics ,0
"Mathias von Gersdorff , German pro - life activist and book author , states on his own blog , the upcoming Spring Assembly of the German Bishops ' Conference will become crucial in this matter ",0
"As he sees it , “ the bishops of Germany who will meet next week for the Spring Assembly of the Bishops ' Conference find themselves in a complicated situation , ” where they will have to show their colors ",0
"They will either be in favor of the Catholic Church 's teaching on sexuality and marriage and forbid such blessings , or “ essentially accept them , ” at least by “ saying nothing ",0

"Finally , the shocking surge in immigrant displacement of American workers and in the immigrant workforce , which began in January and completely undid the improvement we had begun hopefully to call the “ Trump Effect ” has stalled ",0
"May job numbers released Friday show native - born Americans big winners and immigrants ( legal and illegal , the Labor Department does n’t distinguish ) big losers ",1
But displacement and immigrant workforce growth are still high in absolute terms and could resume anytime ,0
"Only legislation , above all an immigration moratorium , can secure the fruits of the current economic expansion for Americans ",1
In May : ,0
"Immigrant employment fell by 1.068 million , down by 3.81 % ",0
Native - born American employment rose by 1.361 million — up 1.1 % ,0
"The immigrant employment index , set to 100.0 in January 2009 , fell to 124.7 from 129.6 in April ",0
The native - born American employment index rose to 106.6 from 105.4 in April ,0
"The New VDARE American Worker Displacement Index ( NVDAWDI ) , our term for the ratio of immigrant to native - born employment growth indexes , fell to 117.0 from the all - time high,123.0 , recorded in April ",0
"Ca n't render , error ",0
"In other words , Trump has not even begun to repair the damage done by eight years of Obama ",0
Native - born American workers lost ground to their foreign - born competitors throughout the Obama years ,0
"And , shown above , this trend accelerated significantly in the months leading up to the election ",0
"While May was a welcome respite , Trump supporters have reason to complain : Since taking office in January 2017 President Trump has presided over a labor market in which immigrants have gained 1.006 million jobs , a 3.9 % increase , while native - born Americans gained about 2.4 million jobs —a rise of only 1.9 % ",1
"As far as the labor market is concerned , “ America First ” has not translated to Americans First ",1
"In normal times , this might be a big story ",0
But the even the conservative non - Main Stream Media is currently too steeped in economic euphoria to notice ,1
"Nd anyway , they almost never report the immigration dimension ",0
"However , it is now absolutely clear that immigration , and immigrant displacement of American workers , can not be jawboned away ",1
"The only answer is legislation— border wall to stop the illegal alien flow ; a second Operation Wetback , including E - Verify , to get the illegal alien self - deporting ; a moratorium on legal immigration ",1
May 2018 was the fifth consecutive month in which the foreign - born working age population ( including illegals ) grew by more than 1 million from the same month the prior year ,0
"But May ’s growth was less than that in April and March , possibly an emerging trend ",0
"Ca n't render , error ",0
In May 2018 there were 1.342 million more working - age immigrants than in May 2017 ,0
This comes on the heels of gains of 2.154 million and 1.597 million ,1
"year - over - year , in March and April , respectively ",0
"It ’s hard to believe with the evaporation of the Trump Effect , but less than six months ago we were seeing to year - over - year declines in the immigrant workforce population ",1
"The last five months of 2017 saw the foreign - born population fall by an average 100,000 from the same month of the prior year ( shown in red on our chart ) ",0
These are net figures ,0
"Over a 12-month period an average of perhaps 300,000 immigrants die and an equal number leave the U.S. voluntarily ",0
"So the 1.342 million net rise in foreign - born population , May 2017 to May 2018 , implies that nearly 2 million foreign - born individuals may have actually settled in the country over those 12 months ",0
( This excludes tourists and other short - term entrants ,0
) ,0
"In percentage terms , the immigrant working - age population grew 3.24 % over the 12 months ",0
"If this growth rate persists , it portends a doubling in 22 years ",0
"By contrast , the native - born American population rose 0.63 % over this period —a rate that will require 114 years for a doubling ",0
"If both rates persist that long , the term “ native born ” will refer to a minuscule fraction of the U.S. population ",1
Another way of looking at American worker displacement : the immigrant share of total U.S. employment : ,0
"Ca n't render , error ",0
Immigrants accounted for 17.36 % of total employment in May. ,0
"Note that , while significantly below the all - time high of 18.1 % recorded in April , the May figure is third highest among the 113 months for which we have data ",0

Did Saint Francis Predict Pope Francis ? ,0
Traditionalists are often derided by neo - Catholic commentators for relying on supposedly apocryphal quotations from Popes or saints bearing on the current ecclesial crisis ,0
"But these critics never demonstrate that the oft - cited quotations are apocryphal ; they merely assert that they must be , as they seem too probative to be true ",0
"This is often done in comment boxes or responses to online queries at neo - Catholic websites , wherein the neo - Catholic commentator professes he can find no source for a given quotation — meaning he has n’t bothered to do any serious investigation beyond a few Google searches ",1
"Take this quotation of Pius XII , for example , speaking in 1931 when he was still Monsignor Pacelli , serving as Pius XI ’s Secretary of State : ",0
I am worried by the Blessed Virgin ’s messages to Lucy of Fatima ,0
"This persistence of Mary about the dangers which menace the Church is a divine warning against the suicide that would be represented by the alteration of the faith , in her liturgy , her theology and her soul … ",0
"I hear all around me innovators who wish to dismantle the Sacred Chapel , destroy the universal flame of the Church , reject her ornaments and make her feel remorse for her historical past ",1
"A day will come when the civilized world will deny its God , when the Church will doubt as Peter doubted ",0
She will be tempted to believe that man has become God ,0
"In our churches , Christians will search in vain for the red lamp where God awaits them ",1
"Like Mary Magdalene , weeping before the empty tomb , they will ask , “ Where have they taken Him ? ” ",1
"When I first cited this quotation some 17 years ago , I was contacted by a very prominent neo - Catholic luminary who demanded a source for it , because he and his friends believed it was “ apocryphal ",0

"A Modernist apostate priest , one Emile Poulet , who left the priesthood and married , attempted to cast doubt on the credibility of Msgr ",0
Roche ’s account of the words of the future Pius XII ,0
"Small wonder : Poulet , who died in 2014 at the age of 94 , belonged to the “ worker - priest ” movement that none other than Pius XII had condemned , as I note here ",0
His attempt to debunk the quotation involved nit - picking about what he claimed were factual errors elsewhere in the Roche biography ,1
But he had no evidence that the quotation as such was a fabrication ,1
He simply wished that it was so ,1
Let ’s give our neo - Catholic friends another “ apocryphal ” quotation to dismiss out of hand ,1
This one pertains to an astonishing prophecy by Saint Francis of Assisi about a future occupant of the Chair of Peter : ,1
"A short time before the holy Father ’s [ St. Francis’ ] death , he called together his children and warned them of the coming troubles : ",0
"“ Act bravely , my brethren ; take courage and trust in the Lord ",1
"The time is fast approaching in which there will be great trials and afflictions ; perplexities and dissensions , both spiritual and temporal , will abound ; the charity of many will grow cold , and the malice of the wicked will increase ",1
"The devils will have unusual power ; the immaculate purity of our Order , and of others , will be so much obscured that there will be very few Christians who obey the true Supreme Pontiff and the Roman Church with loyal ears and perfect charity ",1
"“ At the time of this tribulation a man , not canonically elected , will be raised to the Pontificate , who , by his cunning , will endeavour to draw many into error and death ",0
"Then scandals will be multiplied , our Order will be divided , and many others will be entirely destroyed , because they will consent to error instead of opposing it ",0
"“ There will be such diversity of opinions and schisms among the people , the religious and the clergy , that , except those days were shortened , according to the words of the Gospel , even the elect would be led into error , were they not specially guided , amid such great confusion , by the immense mercy of God … ",0
"“ Those who persevere in their fervor and adhere to virtue with love and zeal for the truth , will suffer injuries and persecutions as rebels and schismatics ; for their persecutors , urged on by the evil spirits , will say they are rendering a great service to God by destroying such pestilent men from the face of the earth … ",1
"“ Some preachers will keep silent about the truth , and others will trample it under foot and deny it ",0
"Sanctity of life will be held in derision even by those who outwardly profess it , for in those days Our Lord Jesus Christ will send them , not a true Pastor , but a destroyer ",0
” [ paragraph breaks added ] ,0
"This quotation appears in Works of the Seraphic Father , St. Francis of Assisi , published in 1882 by the London - based Catholic publishing house R. Washbourne , 1882 , pp ",0
248 - 250 ) ,0
It is readily available as a Google book ,0
"The same book , it must be noted , contains an appendix setting forth “ Doubtful Works of Saint Francis , ” of which the quotation is not part ",0
"Thus , the publisher itself carefully distinguished the authentic prophecies of Saint Francis from what might be apocryphal ",0
"Moreover , in 1882 there could hardly have been any “ radical traditionalist ” motive to circulate phony quotations of the saint ",1
""""""""" St. Francis in Ecstacy """""""" , Caravaggio , 1595 ",0
"Saint Francis’ prophecy is clearly not a prediction of the Great Western Schism ( 1378 - 1417 ) , which did not involve a “ destroyer ” on the Chair of Peter who leads the faithful into error , widespread apostasy , and the persecution of faithful Catholics as “ schismatics ",0
” But it does contain elements very familiar to us today ,0
And what inference might one draw from the coincidence that Saint Francis’ prophecy of a future “ destroyer ” in the papal office seems to correspond rather well with the pontificate of the only Pope who has taken Francis’ name as his own ? ,1
"Something else to consider : Saint Francis , one of the greatest saints in Church history , one of the few who is known and revered by the whole world , freely revealed his vision of an ecclesial destroyer who usurps the papal office ",0
"That is , Saint Francis did not suffer from the currently reigning papolatry , which holds that the indefectibility of the Church depends upon defending every word and deed of a given Pope as somehow consistent with Tradition and declares absolutely inadmissible the idea that the holder of the Petrine office could be a threat to the integrity of the Faith ",0

"In Newly Obtained Memo , Congress’ Top Cop Said House Democratic Caucus Server VANISHED https://t.co/gTj2UgSZJr via @dailycaller — Luke Rosiak ( @lukerosiak ) July 2 , 2018 ",1
A secret memo marked “ URGENT ” detailed how the House Democratic Caucus ’s server went “ missing ” soon after it became evidence in a cybersecurity probe ,0
The secret memo also said more than “ 40 House offices may have been victims of IT security violations ,0
” ,0
"In the memo , Congress ’s top law enforcement official , Sergeant - at - Arms Paul Irving , along with Chief Administrative Officer Phil Kiko , wrote , “ We have concluded that the employees [ Democratic systems administrator Imran Awan and his family ] are an ongoing and serious risk to the House of Representatives , possibly threatening the integrity of our information systems and thereby members’ capacity to serve constituents ",0
” ,0
"The memo , addressed to the Committee on House Administration ( CHA ) and dated Feb. 3 , 2017 , was recently reviewed and transcribed by The Daily Caller News Foundation ",0
The letter bolsters TheDCNF ’s previous reporting about the missing server and evidence of fraud on Capitol Hill ,0
"It details how the caucus server , run by then - caucus Chairman Rep. Xavier Becerra , was secretly copied by authorities after the House Inspector General ( IG ) identified suspicious activity on it , but the Awans’ physical access was not blocked ",0
"But after , the report reads , the server appears to have been secretly replaced with one that looked similar ",0
"The memo called for firing the Pakistani - born aides , revoking all their computer accounts , and changing the locks on any door they had access to ",0
Rep. Louie Gohmert — a Texas Republican on the House Committee on the Judiciary who has done oversight work on the case — said the missing server contained copies of Congress members’ emails ,0
"“ They put 40 members of Congress ’s data on one server … That server , with that serial number , has disappeared , ” he said ",0
"Multiple sources connected to the investigation told TheDCNF that shortly after an IG report came out identifying the House Democratic Caucus server as key evidence in a criminal probe , the evidence was stolen ",0
"“ They [ the Awans ] deliberately turned over a fake server ” to falsify evidence , one official close to the CHA alleged ",0
“ It was a breach ,0
The data was completely out of [ members’ ] possession ,0
” ,0
The six - page letter says : ,0
• In September of 2016 … the CHA and [ IG ] briefed the former Chairman of the Democratic Caucus about suspicious activity related to their server that the [ IG ] identified ,0
"As a result , the former Chairman of the Democratic Caucus directed the CAO to copy the data from their server and two computers ",0
• The CHA directed the IG to refer the matter to the US Capitol Police ,0
The USCP initiated an investigation that continues to this day ,0
"• In late 2016 , the former Chairman of the Democratic Caucus announced his intention to resign from Congress to assume a new position ",0
"The CAO and [ sergeant - at - arms ] worked with the Chairman to account for his inventory , including the one server ",0
"• While reviewing the inventory , the CAO discovered that the serial number of the server did not match that of the one imaged in September ",0
"[ Investigators ] also discovered that the server in question [ the replacement server ] was still operating under the employee ’s control , contrary to the explicit instructions of the former chairman to turn over all equipment and fully cooperate with the inquiry and investigation ",0
"[ A House source said the """""""" employee ” was Abid Awan ",0
] ,0
• The USCP interviewed relevant staff regarding the missing server ,0
"• On January 24 , 2017 , the CAO acquired the [ r[replacement]erver from the control of the employees and transferred that server to the USCP ",0
President Donald Trump referenced the Democratic Caucus’ missing server in a tweet ,0
"But because the letter to the CHA was kept secret , many news outlets have not grasped that the House ’s top cop documented a “ missing server ” connected to the Democratic Caucus ",1
"The timeline laid out in the letter also shows that Becerra — now California ’s Democratic attorney general — failed to ensure that the Awans did n’t have access to House computer systems during the 2016 election , which was wrought with cybersecurity scandals ",1
An IG presentation from September 2016 shows that Becerra knew of problems months before the server disappeared ,0
"“ The Caucus Chief of Staff requested one of the shared employees to not provide IT services or access their computers , ” it read ",0
“ This shared employee continued ,0
” It ’s unclear why that request was not granted or why it was a request rather than an order ,1
"A House official close to the probe said the employee was Abid , who was not on Becerra or the Caucus ’s payroll ",0
The official said Becerra Chief of Staff Sean McCluskie apparently knew Abid was accessing Caucus servers ,0
"According to payroll records , Abid ’s sister - in - law , Hina Alvi , was the Caucus’ systems administrator ",0
"The Awans’ continued physical access to Becerra ’s equipment after red flags emerged enabled the server to disappear after it became evidence , House officials close to the investigation told TheDCNF ",0
"( RELATED : Becerra Tried To Block Awan From House Democratic Caucus Server , But Logins Continued ; He Did n’t Go To Cops ) ",0
"Becerra has refused to comment , citing an ongoing criminal investigation ",0
"The February 2017 memo itemizes “ numerous and egregious violations of House IT security ” by members of the Awan family , including using Congress members’ usernames and “ the unauthorized storage of sensitive House information outside the House ",1
” ,0
"“ These employees accessed user accounts and computers for offices that did not employ them , without the knowledge and permission of the impacted Member ’s office , ” it said , adding , “ 4 of the employees accessed the Democratic Caucus computers 5,735 times ",0
"” More than 100 office computers were open to access from people not on the office ’s staff , it said ",0
"Chris Gowen — a former aide to Hillary Clinton who is now serving as Imran ’s attorney — told TheDCNF , “ There is no missing server and never was ",0
” ,0
"He did n’t provide any support for his claim , which is contrary to evidence Kiko and Irving presented to Congress ",1
"The memo said the CHA possesses voluminous evidence , including , “ Interview notes with House Members’ Chiefs of Staff , ” and “ Logon activity and computer access logs ",0
” Prosecutors have not brought charges ,0
"The Awans were banned from Congress ’s computer network the day the letter was sent , and Kiko held a briefing to convey the message to chiefs of staff for members who employed them ",0
But Democrats claim they were never told about any of the cybersecurity issues itemized in the urgent memo ,0
"Rep. Jackie Speier — a California Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence who employed Imran and his wife , Hina Alvi — said she never heard of any missing server ",0
Joaquin Castro of Texas — another Democratic intelligence committee member who employed one of the Awans — told TheDCNF that Kiko never told him of any cybersecurity issues whatsoever and that the Awan probe was instead described as a theft issue ,0
"Indeed , the CHA issued only one public statement on the case and titled it the “ House Theft Investigation ” — wording that avoids cybersecurity words while political news coverage raged about other cybersecurity issues in the 2016 election ",1
"Yet even the alleged theft has not resulted in criminal charges — even though the letter also says House authorities have “ purchase orders and vouchers ” that allegedly show procurement fraud , as well as testimony from a Democratic chief of staff to Rep. Yvette Clarke , who warned of procurement fraud ",0
"The FBI arrested Imran at the airport in July 2017 for alleged bank fraud that occurred six months prior , and Democrats have since claimed that the case is about nothing but bank fraud ",0
"Bank fraud does not explain why the Awans were kicked off the House network concurrent with the urgent memo , which did not cite bank fraud ",0
A Democratic IT aide who alleged that Imran solicited a bribe from him told TheDCNF he believes members of Congress are playing dumb and covering the matter up ,1
"Wendy Anderson , a former chief of staff to New York Rep. Yvette Clarke , told House investigators that she suspected that her predecessor , Shelley Davis , was working with Abid on a theft scheme , but Clarke refused to fire Abid until outside investigators got involved , TheDCNF reported ",0
"Eighteen months after the evidence was recounted in the urgent memo , prosecution appears to have stalled for reasons not publicly explained ",0
Imran is in court July 3 for a possible plea deal in the bank fraud case ,0
"Gohmert said the FBI has refused to accept evidence demonstrating alleged House misconduct , and some witnesses with first - hand knowledge say the bureau has not interviewed them ",0

"David Duke , the white supremacist icon and former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan , has been denounced by many as a hatemonger , and rightfully so ",1
"However , one individual who represents the Muslim community of South Florida , Sofian Zakkout , is enamored with Duke and has been promoting Duke ’s bigoted work for many years ",1
"Last month , once again , Zakkout chose to showcase this work by posting four consecutive Duke videos on his ( Zakkout ’s ) personal Facebook page ",0
The postings can be rivaled only by Zakkout ’s own documented bigotry ,0
Sofian Abdelaziz Zakkout is the President of the American Muslim Association of North America ( AMANA ) ,0
He has ties to two dozen mosques stretching from Palm Beach County down to Miami - Dade ,0
"On September 21 , 2017 , Zakkout took to Facebook and posted four David Duke videos ",0
"Three of the videos were put out by Duke ’s official website , DavidDuke.com , one referring to CNN news anchor Wolf Blitzer as a “ Jewish Zionist Agent ",1
"” The fourth video was a news report featuring a clip of Duke being interviewed at a white nationalist rally held in Charlottesville , Virginia this past August ",1
"At this same rally , a white nationalist plowed his car into a group of people who were protesting the rally , killing one ",1
This was not the first time Zakkout has promoted David Duke ,0
"Indeed , he has done so for years ",0
"In February 2016 , Zakkout publicized on his Facebook page a bizarre Duke report , titled in part ‘ Dr. ",1
"David Duke Exposes the Real Racist Jewish Supremacists Who Orchestrate the Destruction of European Mankind … ’ Above the posting , Zakkout wrote of Duke , “ I respect him for his honesty ! ” ",1
"In October 2015 , Zakkout posted to Facebook a Duke video , within which Duke makes the wild claim that there has been a “ complete takeover of American foreign policy and … American politics by Jewish extremists ",1
"” Above the video on Facebook , Zakkout praised Duke , exclaiming “ David Duke , a man to believe in ! ” ",1
"In July 2010 , the Anti - Defamation League ( ADL ) condemned Zakkout and his group AMANA for featuring another anti - Semitic Duke video on the AMANA website ",0
The ADL described the video as “ venomous ,1

David Duke ’s bigoted and inciting material is not the only hate Zakkout promotes ,0
"He also pedals much bigotry coming from others , including himself ",0
"In July 2017 , Zakkout posted on his Facebook page a four - minute portion of a speech given by Louis Farrakhan at the Nation of Islam ’s February 2017 Saviors’ Day ",0
"On the video , Farrakhan repeatedly refers to Jews as “ Satan ",1
"” He states to his audience : “ Really , they ’re not Jews ",0
"No , that ’s Satan ",1
"You should learn to call them by their real name , ‘ Satan.’ You ’re coming face to face with Satan , the Arch Deceiver , the enemy of God , and the enemy of the righteous ",1

"In June 2016 , Zakkout clicked ‘ like’ under someone else ’s Facebook posting ( on Zakkout ’s personal Facebook page ) of a grotesque cartoon containing a worried - looking religious Jew hiding behind an animated tree with a bearded man brandishing a rifle coming towards them ",1
"The tree is speaking to the man in Arabic , saying “ Oh Muslim ! ",0

"In April 2016 , Zakkout promoted a report discussing the absurd notion of Jewish involvement in the September 11th attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon ",1
A photo from the report shows the burning towers with a Jewish Star affixed to one ,0
"The report begins , “ It ai n’t debatable ! ",0
"Soup to nuts , top to bottom , the 9/11/01 terrorist attacks on New York City and Washington D.C. were an ‘ Israeli’-Jewish job ",0

"” It was produced by The Realist Report , an anti - Jew , anti - black , anti - gay independent media outlet , which describes Hitler as “ the greatest leader in modern Western history ",1

"In December 2015 , Zakkout posted a photo of Israel Defense Forces ( IDF ) Chief of Staff Gadi Eizenkot , who is a decorated veteran of many different wars and battles fought by Israel over the last three - plus decades ",0
"Above the picture of Eizenkot , Zakkout wrote in Arabic , “ You ’re a Jew , the grandson of a monkey and a pig ",1

Confirmed : Authorities LIED About Las Vegas Shooter ’s Hotel Check - In Date – What Else Are They Hiding ? ,1
Over the last few days the alternative media has spent countless hours conducting their own investigations into what actually happened during the mass shooting in Las Vegas that left 59 dead and over 500 injured ,0
"From reports of multiple shooters to officials seemingly covering up the ISIS connection , many different theories have been put forth that counter the mainstream narrative ",1
"Now , new information released by investigative reporter Laura Loomer proves that authorities have directly lied to the American people about the case at least once by claiming that supposed shooter Stephen Paddock checked into the Mandalay Bay Hotel on September 28th when valet records ( with photos ) prove he actually arrived three days earlier ",1
"According to Loomer , she obtained the image from a source which shows that Paddock ’s car first arrived September 25th ",1
The photo even has a handwritten note that was reportedly written by an FBI agent – proving that the FBI specifically lied to the country ,1
"The picture “ proves FBI misled public about # StephenPaddock ’s check in date , ” Loomer Tweeted ",0

"pic.twitter.com/y9hS6GqdKI — Laura Loomer ( @LauraLoomer ) October 6 , 2017 ",0
"That ’s right , photographic evidence from inside the hotel parking garage has confirmed that the FBI , along with state and local police , specifically lied about key details of the shooting ",0
This throws their entire narrative into question and makes one wonder what else is being hidden from the public ? ,1
Keep in mind that at least four videos from the scene of the shooting have already been released that indicate there were multiple shooters ,0
"In fact , there are so many unanswered questions that the Drudge Report even linked to an article asking them directly ",0
"As noted above , at this point literally every piece of so - called evidence put forth by authorities and then regurgitated by the mainstream media can not be trusted and should be considered as disinformation until proven otherwise ",1
"And if Paddock really did act alone and this evidence is some sort of mistake , there is surely video footage proving so ",0

The Left ’s Show Trial for Kavanaugh ,1
"Two more women accusing Judge Brett Kavanaugh of dubious improprieties materialized out of thin air late Sunday , throwing Senate Republicans’ hope of finally confirming the Supreme Court nominee this week even more into doubt ",1
"The new allegations came yesterday amid reports that Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley ( R - Iowa ) tentatively scheduled a hearing for this Thursday to take testimony from Christine Blasey Ford , 51 , who claims Kavanaugh , 53 , sexually assaulted her decades ago when he was a high school student ",0
"Suspiciously , Ford ca n’t –or won’t— say when or where the alleged incident happened and can provide few details ",1
"As Paul Sperry writes at the New York Post , working with Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif ",0
") and backed financially by George Soros ’s money , Ford ’s lawyers spent the last few days gaming the system ",1
"After stalling Grassley and getting repeated extensions , the attorneys got the chairman to cave on various demands , such as that Kavanaugh not be in the room when Ford gives evidence ",0
Republicans never seem to learn from their mistakes ,0
"As usual , Republicans’ seeming reasonableness is rewarded with more abuse by the Left ",0
Give left - wingers an inch and they ’ll take a mile ,1
"Democrats , it turns out , used the extra time created through their delaying tactics to produce two new women with questionable claims against Kavanaugh ",0
More accusers could be on their way ,0
"President Trump continues to support Kavanaugh , who maintains his innocence ",0
"“ This alleged event from 35 years ago did not happen , ” the nominee said Sunday of Ford ’s accusations ",0
"“ The people who knew me then know that this did not happen , and have said so ",0
"This is a smear , plain and simple ",1
"I look forward to testifying on Thursday about the truth , and defending my good name — and the reputation for character and integrity I have spent a lifetime building — against these last - minute allegations ",0
” ,0
"If Kavanaugh is n’t on the bench on October 1 , the Supreme Court will be shorthanded as it begins hearing cases in its new term ",0
"The high court normally has a complement of nine justices but with Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy ’s retirement July 31 , which cleared the way for Kavanaugh ’s nomination , there have only been only eight justices in place ",0
Roughly speaking there is a 4-to-4 liberal to conservative ideological split on the court ,0
Democrats would prefer to drag the confirmation process into the next Congress where they stand a good chance of taking control from Republicans ,0
Election Day is November 6 ,0
"The GOP currently controls the Senate , which has the final say on judicial nominations , by an uncomfortably close margin of 51 to 49 ",0
"Meanwhile , the New Yorker magazine reported Sunday that Deborah Ramirez , 53 , suddenly claims to have been assaulted by Kavanaugh at a drunken party decades ago at Yale College ",0
Ramirez claims Kavanaugh exposed himself to her and brushed his genitals against her ,0
"Also on Sunday , media - savvy sleazeball lawyer Michael Avenatti , who represents porn star Stormy Daniels , tweeted that he represents another woman who plans to accuse Kavanaugh of something ",1
“ I represent a woman with credible information regarding Judge Kavanaugh and Mark Judge ,0
"We will be demanding the opportunity to present testimony to the committee and will likewise be demanding that Judge and others be subpoenaed to testify , ” Avenatti wrote on Twitter ",0
“ My client is not Deborah Ramirez ,0
” ,0
"Washington insiders still believe Kavanaugh will be confirmed , or at least they did before the two new accusers popped up ",0
"For example , at a Friday afternoon preview of upcoming cases in the Supreme Court ’s approaching October term that was hosted by the Federalist Society , panelist Thomas C. Goldstein of the law firm of Goldstein & Russell predicted that the high court would have nine members again soon ",0
"“ There is exactly a zero percent chance that [ Senate Majority Leader ] Mitch McConnell and Chuck Grassley will allow this thing to get past the lame - duck ” congressional session after Election Day , said the co - founder of SCOTUSblog who has appeared before the Supreme Court many times ",1
“ I think we ought to recognize that ,0
"The prospect that the Democrats will take the Senate , albeit thin , is realistic , and so they will do whatever is necessary in order to make sure that there is a ninth member of the court there by the time a Democratic majority could take over in the Senate in January ",0

"Almost equally important , North Korea boasts one of the word ’s biggest armies – 1,020,000 men , 88,000 crack special forces , and an trained militia of over 5 million ",0
The North ’s weapons are obsolescent ; its small air forces and navy will be vaporized by US power but its troops are deeply dug into the mountainous terrain and would be fighting from prepared positions ,1

"North Korea ’s Kim Jong - un has played right along , clearly relishing his game of chicken with tough - talking Donald Trump ",1
Trump seemed certain he could somehow cajole China into disarming North Korea ’s nuclear arsenal ,0

Will Trump Continue the CIA ’s JFK Cover - Up ? ,0
"Last Friday , President Trump made the following announcement : ",0
"I have decided not to block release of the CIA ’s remaining JFK - assassination related records except for those records that directly implicate the CIA in the assassination , which will continue to remain secret ",0
” ,0
"Okay , he did n’t really put it like that ",0
"But that ’s the potential and likely import of his announcement , which actually read as follows : ",0
"Subject to the receipt of further information , I will be allowing , as President , the long blocked and classified JFK FILES to be opened ",0
” ( Italics added ,0
) ,0
"The operative words , of course , are : “ Subject to the receipt of further information … ",0
” ,0
What is going on here ? ,0
Negotiations ,0
The art of the deal ,0
The CIA desperately does not want to show the American people its long - secret JFK - related records ,0
It has asked Trump to continue keeping at least some of them secret notwithstanding the passage of more than 50 years since the Kennedy assassination ,0
"Under long - established custom and tradition in Washington , D.C. , when someone asks someone else for a favor , the person who is in a position to grant the favor demands something in return ",0
That ’s where the negotiations between Trump and the CIA come into play ,0
Trump wants something in return ,0
We do n’t know what — maybe laying off on the Russia investigation — but his announcement last Friday is obviously part of the concluding steps of such negotiations ,0
Time to buy old US gold coins ,0
What Trump has done with his announcement is send a clear message to the CIA : “ Give me what I want and I ’ll give you want you want ,0
"Otherwise , I will let all your cherished long - secret records relating to the JFK assassination be shown to the American people ",1
” ,0
Make no mistake about it : A deal is about to be made ,0
The CIA will cave ,0
It will end up giving Trump whatever it is he wants ,0
Trump is in the driver ’s seat because the CIA can not afford to permit the American people to see the records it wants to continue to be kept secret ,1
"And once the CIA gives Trump what he wants , he will cave and give the CIA the continued secrecy it so desperately needs ",1
"All this will happen by this Thursday , the date set by law for release of all the JFK records that Trump has not blocked ",0
"Think about it : The CIA has asked the president to continue secrecy of records that are more than 50 years old or , apparently , some relating to secret correspondence between the CIA and the Assassination Records Review Board back in the 1990s ",0
The CIA ’s ground ? ,0
"“ National security ” of course , the two most important and meaningless words in the American political lexicon ",1
National security ? ,0
Really ? ,0
"Whatever definition that one might put on that nebulous term , no reasonable person can honestly believe that the release of 50-year - old records are going to result in the United States falling into the ocean or even that the communists are going to take over the federal government ",1
The CIA says that releasing its decades - old JFK records will reveal secret “ methods ” of intelligence gathering ,0
Really ? ,1
"What , like the CIA was using typewriters instead of computers and pay telephones instead of cell phones ? ",1
What is amazing ( or not ) is the extreme nonchalance of the mainstream media to the CIA ’s request for continued secrecy ,1
That should be big news ,0
"It ’s essentially an admission of guilt , given that it is absolutely ludicrous to think that “ national security ” would be threatened by the release of the CIA ’s long - secret JFK - assassination - related records ",1
"You see , the mainstream media starts with the assumption that the CIA had nothing to do with the assassination ",0
"In their minds , the assassination was committed by a lone nut former U.S. Marine communist , one who had no motive to kill the president ",1
"Such being the case , the mainstream media , deferring to the CIA , automatically concludes that its wish to continue keeping secret has to be based on “ national security ” grounds rather than an attempt by the CIA to continue its cover - up of its assassination of the president ",0
"Let ’s proceed from the opposite assumption : That the CIA , in partnership with the military and the Mafia , orchestrated the assassination by framing a former U.S. Marine who was then working for U.S. intelligence , either Navy intelligence , the CIA , or the FBI , or a combination of all three ",0
"Do n’t forget , after all , that that ’s what Oswald said ",0
He said he was being framed ,0
"Yet , from the very beginning , the mainstream media has never given any serious consideration to the possibility that Oswald was framed for the crime ",1
"Instead , they have steadfastly stuck with the official story , one that has all the characteristics of a pat frame - up : That Oswald acted alone or possibly acted in concert with others , both of which lead to nothing but dead ends , contradictions , and anomalies ",1
"Now , let ’s assume instead that Oswald was telling the truth when he said he was being framed ",0
"In that case , it would be imperative that the CIA and the military keep as tight a lid on their records as possible to ensure that investigators or investigative reporters would have a difficult time piercing through to the circumstantial evidence that establishes the frame - up ",0
"As part of the frame - up , the CIA would have to fortify the persona of Oswald , its intelligence agent , as a purported communist ",1
"That would enable the CIA to blame the assassination on a communist , which , not coincidentally , was the advice that the Pentagon and the CIA were doling out to Latin American military dictatorships at the School of the Americas ",1
"In cases of covert state - sponsored assassinations , Latin American regimes were taught , a good strategy was to blame the assassination on a communist because then they could smear anyone who challenged the official story as a communist sympathizer ",1
"It would also explain why the CIA was closely monitoring Oswald ’s movements prior to the assassination , something else that the CIA kept secret for decades ",0
They had to make certain that Oswald was not on to them and had not discovered that he was being set up for a frame - up ,1
"The first organization that came out with a press release advertising Oswald ’s bona fides was the DRE , an anti - communist group in New Orleans with which Oswald had had contact ",0
"What no one knew at the time , and what the CIA intentionally kept secret for decades , was that the DRE was a CIA front organization ",0
"It was being generously funded by the CIA and controlled by a secret CIA agent named George Joannides , which the CIA would intentionally keep secret from the Warren Commission in the 1960s , the House Select Committee in the 1970s , and the Assassination Records Review Board in the 1990s ",0
But there was another big operation to establish Oswald ’s communist bona fides before the assassination ,0
"It had to do with Oswald ’s trip to Mexico City , where he visited the Cuban and Soviet embassies ",0
Something dreadful obviously went wrong with that part of the operation because the official investigation into it was quickly shut down during the early post - assassination period ,1
"Today , Oswald ’s Mexico City trip , which is part of those CIA records ready to be released , is still shrouded in mystery ",0
The CIA ’s continued secrecy in the JFK assassination is no big surprise ,0
"As I wrote in my October 11 article , “ Will Trump Make a Deal with the CIA on JFK Records ? , ” the CIA is between a rock and a hard place ",0
"On the one hand , it knows that those records will further implicate the CIA in the Kennedy assassination ",1
"On the other hand , it knows that by seeking continued secrecy , it ’s essentially an implicit acknowledgment of guilt ",1
"Not surprisingly , it is choosing the latter course , especially because it knows that its assets and allies in the mainstream press will continue to come to its defense with respect to its ridiculous claim of “ national security ",1
” ,0
Do the CIA ’s long - secret records contain a video - taped confession ? ,0
Of course not ,0
And they do n’t contain any reference to assassinating Kennedy ,0
The CIA ’s practice from the very beginning has been to not put any reference to a state - sponsored assassination into writing ,0
But there has to be a reason why the CIA chose to keep this particular batch of records secret for more than 50 years ,0
"Those long - secret records undoubtedly include small bits of important circumstantial evidence that fill out even further the mosaic of a regime - change operation that took place in Dallas in November 1963 , the same types of regime - change operation that took place in Iran in 1953 , Guatemala in 1954 , Cuba in 1960 - 1963 , Congo in 1961 , and Chile in 1973 , all of which the CIA steadfastly kept secret from the American people ",1
"In 1953 , the CIA was in the process of developing a top - secret manual on assassinations , one that showed that the CIA was specializing not only in the art of assassination but also in the art of covering up its role in state - sponsored assassinations ",0
Every American owes it to himself to read that manual ,1
Too bad the mainstream press has never given that manual the consideration it deserves ,0
"If it did , it might not be so deferential to the deal that Trump and the CIA are about to make to continue the JFK assassination cover - up by continuing to keep some of the CIA ’s decades - old JFK ’s related assassination records secret from the American people ",1

"Cardinal Burke to Michael Matt : """""""" Amoris Not An Exercise of Magisterium """""""" ( Now what ? ) ",0
"Given that Pope Francis has , since that interview took place , attempted to make the Argentine bishops’ interpretation of AL ' magisterial'--an interpretation that allows public adulterers to receive Holy Communion -- Cardinal Burke ’s reply to my question on January 9th of this year would seem to take on new relevancy ",0
"In my interview of Raymond Cardinal Burke less than one year ago , I asked His Eminence to clarify what , exactly , is the level of authoritative weight of Pope Francis ’s post - synodal exhortation , Amoris Laetitia ",0
"Now , Cardinal Francesco Coccopalmerio , president of the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts , made it very clear to the Catholic News Service on December 5 what the Pope is up to : “ The fact that the pope requested that his letter and the interpretations of the Buenos Aires bishops be published in the AAS means that His Holiness has given these documents a particular qualification that elevates them to the level of being official teachings of the church ",0
"While the content of the pope ’s letter itself does not contain teachings on faith and morals , it does point toward the interpretations of the Argentine bishops and confirms them as authentically reflecting his own mind ",0
Thus together the two documents became the Holy Father ’s authentic magisterium for the whole church ,0
” ,0
"What Cardinal Burke rightly describes as lacking in any magisterial weight whatsoever — and , in fact , in dire need of clarification and correction— has by papal fiat been declared magisterial , and thus binding on us all ",1
Francis made it clear that the Argentine bishops’ interpretation of AL allowing public adulterers to receive Holy Communion “ explains precisely the meaning of Chapter VIII of ‘ Amoris Laetitia.’ There are no other interpretations ,1
” ,1
I would imagine this outrageous overreach of papal authority on the Pope 's part would make it ominously clear to Cardinal Burke that the time has come to issue his public correction of Pope Francis 's erroneous teaching ,1
"The moment , it would seem , has come ",0
"Cardinal Burke , please and in God 's Holy Name , we beg you to act now -- before Pope Francis succeeds in tearing the Church in half completely ",1
"We fear that your silence now , in the face of this latest papal travesty , may suggest consent to the claim that Amoris Laetitia is magisterial , and thus prove more damaging than if you had never raised your voice at all ",1
"We thank God for the courage you 've shown in defending His Church thus far , and we pray he will continue to bless and protect you as you do what must now be done ",0

The Dictator Pope : A Call to Hierarchical Opposition ,1
"Of that book , no less than Robert Royal — signaling growing alarm over the Bergoglian Debacle in the Catholic mainstream— has written : “ About 90 percent of it is simply incontrovertible , and can not help but clarify who Francis is and what he ’s about ",0
"” And the picture that emerges in stark relief in The Dictator Pope , as Life Site News reports , is that of “ a power - hungry , manipulative dictator , [ who ] celebrated the abdication of Benedict XVI ” because he knew what it meant : that the plan to give him the Keys of Peter in 2005 would finally come to fruition in 2013 ",1
"“ We elected you to make reforms , not to smash everything ! ” Thus is Cardinal Leonardi Sandri , a fellow Argentinian and a supporter of Pope Francis at the conclave of 2013 , reliably reported literally to have screamed at Pope Francis behind closed doors in the Vatican ",1
"Sandri would be one of a number of Bergoglian partisans at the conclave who are now said to be experiencing “ buyer ’s remorse , ” as documented most recently in the explosive best - seller The Dictator Pope ",1
""""""""" When the shepherd becomes a wolf , the first duty of the flock is to defend itself ",0
"The true children of Holy Church , at such times , are those who walk by the light of their Baptism , not the cowardly souls who , under the specious pretext of submission to the powers that be , delay their opposition to the enemy in the hope of receiving instructions which are neither necessary nor desirable ",0
""""""""" ",0
"Francis , writes Royal , “ has little use for established procedures , precedents , even legal structures within the Church … ",0
"When the head of the Church himself does not much feel bound by the tradition or impartial laws he has inherited , what then ? ” What then indeed ? ",0
"The Dictator Pope even feels at liberty to demand that the Lord ’s Prayer be changed to reflect his dissatisfaction with God ’s words : “ And lead us not into temptation [ et ne nos inducas in tentationem ] , ” which Francis has decided , after 2,000 years , is a “ not a good translation ",1
"” Apparently lost on Francis , given the disordered mélange of bits and pieces of things he has read that constitutes his theology , is the distinction between sin , a culpable act , and temptation , which arises from concupiscence or what Saint Thomas called the fomes , or the fleshly inclination to sin , which grace enables us to control by the rule of reason over the passions ",1
But now we are witness to the single worst act of tyranny in the entire history of the papacy ,1
"The Church has seen a number of Popes who have abused their power , Alexander VI being the most popularly known example ",0
"But never , before Francis , has there been a Pope who dared to tyrannize the Magisterium itself by attempting to bend it to his errant personal opinions ",1
"By publication in the Acta Apostolicae Sedis ( AAS ) , Francis has officially declared that the “ authentic Magisterium ” includes the guidelines of the bishops of Buenos Aires for the implementation of Chapter 8 of Amoris Laetitia ( AL ) , which he expressly approved in his letter to them as the only correct interpretation of his will ",0
"The guidelines have been published in the AAS along with Francis ’s private missive , which is suddenly declared to be “ an apostolic letter ",0
” ,0
The normalist narrative has just been stripped of any colorable argument that nothing is too terribly amiss with this pontificate ,0
"We are now expected to believe that the “ authentic Magisterium”—meaning simply and only AL — teaches what the guidelines preposterously declare , solely in reliance on AL : ",0
"When the concrete circumstances of a couple make it feasible , especially when both are Christians with a journey of faith , one may propose that they commit to living in continence … ",0
"In other more complex circumstances , and when it is not possible to obtain a declaration of nullity , the aforementioned option may not , in fact , be viable ",0
"Nonetheless , it is equally possible to undertake a journey of discernment … ",0
"[ I]f one arrives at the recognition that , in a concrete case , there are limitations that diminish responsibility and culpability ( cf ",0
"301 - 302 ) , particularly when a person judges that he would fall into a subsequent fault by damaging the children of the new union , Amoris Laetitia opens up the possibility of access to the Sacraments of Reconciliation and the Eucharist ( cf ",0
notes 336 and 351 ) ,0
"As Francis would have it , then , the “ authentic Magisterium ” has just flatly contradicted itself for the first time in two millennia : ",0
"The admission of public adulterers in “ second marriages ” to Holy Communion , which John Paul II , in line with all of Tradition , called “ intrinsically impossible ” given their objective state in life , is now deemed possible depending on circumstances — that is , situation ethics applied to violations of the Sixth Commandment ",0
The requirement that people embroiled in such unions commit to living in continence before they can be absolved and partake of the Blessed Sacrament — a moral norm binding “ without exception ” because it is rooted in divine law — is suddenly demoted to a mere “ proposal ” that may not be “ feasible ” or “ viable ” in “ the concrete circumstances of the couple ,0
” ,0
"A valid annulment of a truly invalid marriage , the sine qua non for entering into marital relations with another purported spouse , is now dispensed with in “ more complex circumstances … when it is not possible to obtain a declaration of nullity , ” the way thus being opened to de facto divorce in the Catholic Church ",0
The meaningless slogan “ journey of discernment ” cloaks a naked authorization for the official toleration of adulterous sexual relations in the Church ’s sacramental life ,0
"No less than a Roman Pontiff lends his name to the outrageous claim that children resulting from an adulterous relationship , blithely referred to as a “ new union , ” could be “ damaged ” if the partners in adultery were required to cease their adultery in order to be absolved and receive Holy Communion — evidently because the “ new union ” would dissolve without adulterous sexual relations and there could be a second divorce !

"As recently as seventeen years ago , during the reign of John Paul II , the Pontifical Council for the Interpretation of Legislative texts reaffirmed the immutable truth reflected in Canon 915 , which prohibits the administration of Holy Communion to those “ who obstinately persist in manifest grave sin ",0
"” That prohibition , declared the Pontifical Council , applies to the divorced and “ remarried ” not as a matter of mere disciplinary law subject to revocation or modification , but rather “ is derived from divine law and transcends the domain of positive ecclesiastical laws ; [ and ] the latter can not introduce legislative changes which would oppose the doctrine of the Church ",1
” ,0
"Francis , however , has purported to do nothing less invent exceptions to divine law that oppose the doctrine of the Church ",0
"The attempt is void , of course , and the appellation “ authentic Magisterium ” is fraudulent ",0
"But the consequences of this Pope ’s toying with the teaching office of the Church to advance half - baked theological notions , such as “ discernment ” ( a term he borrows from St. Ignatius of Loyola but strips of its original meaning ) are catastrophic ",1
"Over the past year , Cardinal Burke and a few other members of the hierarchy have called upon Francis to “ clarify ” his intention respecting AL ",0
"That clarification has now been given : Francis intends , if it were possible , to change the unchangeable teaching of the Church regarding an irrevocable moral norm rooted in divine law ",0
"Even if the attempt is void and of no effect before man and God — an immoral law is no law at all — Francis clearly means to impose his will by fiat , daring invoke the “ authentic Magisterium ” to cloak his absurd novelties ",1
No Pope before him has ever dared to do such a thing ,1
So now it must be asked : Where are the cardinals and the bishops ? ,0
"With one or two noble ( however inconsistent ) exceptions , their response to the Bergoglian Debacle thus far ranges from silence , to active complicity , to — at best — hand - wringing over the increasingly chaotic state of the Church while begging the Pope to “ clarify ” his already perfectly clear intentions ",0
"At this point , continued pleading for a Bergoglian “ clarification ” can only give rise to an impression of disingenuousness , whereas continued silence about the papal origin of this ongoing catastrophe is a standing rebuke to all the hierarchs who know what we all know : that at the epicenter of the chaos is the most wayward Pope the Church has ever had to endure ",1
"Continued inaction while the laity and a few good priests are left to themselves to defend , as best they can , the constant teaching of the Church against the abuses of a tyrant on the Chair of Peter threatens the hierarchs with a legacy of shame and a terrible accountability before the Just Judge ",1
Their failure to defend the Faith by standing up to the one they know full well is attacking it almost daily lends itself ever more to an indictment for timidity in the face of unprecedented danger to the Church and the cause of the Gospel of which they are divinely charged to be leaders ,0
The time for “ prudence ” is long past ,1
Prudence now gives way to mere pusillanimity ,0
"The time for hierarchical action is now , before the damage to the Church becomes irreparable ",0
"The members of a hierarchy seemingly cowed by a papal tyranny the Church has never before seen must rise immediately and give a courageous answer to the challenge posed long ago by Monsignor Klaus Gamber , when an already monumental ecclesial crisis was still in what can now can be seen as merely a preliminary stage : ",1
Where in our Church are the leaders who can show us the right path ? ,0
"Where are the bishops courageous enough to cut out the cancerous growth of modernist theology that has implanted itself and is festering within the celebration of even the most sacred mysteries , before the cancer spreads and causes even greater damage ? ",1
"What we need today is a new Athanasius , a new Basil , bishops like those who in the fourth century fought courageously against Arianism when almost the whole of Christendom had succumbed to heresy ",0
"Will none of the hierarchs rise to defend the Church as “ a new Athanasius , a new Basil ” ? ",0
Even the best among them continue to limit themselves to generalized lamentations at conferences or in interviews about the parlous state of the Church or at most the “ confusion ” Francis has caused by not “ clarifying ” precisely what he has just clarified ,0
They avoid the absolutely necessary direct and public exposure of error at its source ,0
That error threatens to overwhelm the Church while they do little more than fret about a situation whose self - evident cause — a reckless Pope in love with his own ideas and filled with contempt for Tradition — they seem incapable of identifying ,1
Concerned clergy and laity throughout the Catholic world are doing what they can according to their stations ,0
"But in the midst of that “ final battle ” over marriage and family of which Sister Lucia warned the late Cardinal Caffarra in light of the Third Secret of Fatima , within the human element of the Church only the cardinals and the bishops possess the divinely bestowed power to repel an assault on marriage , family and the very integrity of the Faith that is now , for the first time in Church history , being led by a Roman Pontiff ",1
This undeniably apocalyptic development imposes upon the hierarchs — first and foremost in the Church — the duty to act ,0
"True love for the Church , indeed true charity toward Francis himself , requires of them nothing less than what was required of Saint Paul when the first Pope fell into error that jeopardized the very mission of the Church : that Peter be withstood to his face ( Gal ",1

Paul Manafort Secretly Met With Julian Assange Shortly Before Joining Trump 's Presidential Campaign : Report ,0
A British newspaper alleges that Paul Manafort secretly met WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange at the Ecuadorean Embassy in London within days or weeks of being brought aboard Donald Trump ’s presidential campaign ,0
Lawyers for Assange and Manafort denounced the report as false ,0
"If confirmed , the report Tuesday would suggest a direct connection between the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks , which released tens of thousands of emails stolen by Russian spies during the 2016 election ",0
"The campaign seized on the emails to undermine Trump ’s rival , Hillary Clinton ",0
"The Guardian , which did not identify the sources for its reporting , said that Manafort met with Assange “ around March 2016 ” — the same month that Russian hackers began their all - out effort to steal emails from the Clinton campaign ",0
"In a statement , Manafort called the story “ totally false and deliberately libelous ” and said he was considering his legal options against the Guardian ",1
"“ I have never met Julian Assange or anyone connected to him , ” Manafort said ",0
"“ I have never been contacted by anyone connected to WikiLeaks , either directly or indirectly ",0
I have never reached out to Assange or WikiLeaks on any matter ,1
” ,0
"Assange ’s Ecuadorean lawyer , Carlos Poveda , said the Guardian report was false ",0
And WikiLeaks said on Twitter that it was “ willing to bet the Guardian a million dollars and its editor ’s head that Manafort never met Assange ,1
” It later tweeted that Assange had instructed his lawyers to sue the Guardian for libel ,0
"The Guardian cited two unidentified sources as saying Manafort first met Assange at the embassy in 2013 , a year after Assange took refuge there to avoid being extradited to Sweden over sex crime allegations ",0
The Guardian said Manafort returned there in 2015 and 2016 and said its sources had “ tentatively dated ” the final visit to March ,0
The newspaper added that Manafort ’s visit was not entered into the embassy ’s log book and cited a source as saying Manafort left after 40 minutes ,0
There was no detail on what might have been discussed ,0

Ammo seller to Las Vegas killer arrested on federal charge ,0
"( CNN ) Douglas Haig , an Arizona man who says he sold tracer ammunition to the gunman in October 's Las Vegas massacre , was arrested Friday on a charge of conspiring to manufacture and sell another type of ammunition -- armor - piercing bullets -- in violation of federal law ",0
A criminal complaint alleges two unfired .308-caliber ( 7.62 mm ) rounds found in gunman Stephen Paddock 's hotel room had Haig 's fingerprints on them as well as tool marks from his workshop ,0
"The bullets in the cartridges were armor - piercing , with an incendiary capsule in the nose , the complaint says ",0
"The FBI on October 19 searched Haig 's Mesa home and seized ammunition the agency says is armor - piercing , the complaint said ",0
"Haig did not have a license to manufacture armor - piercing ammunition , documents said ",0
"Police say Paddock , 64 , opened fire on October 1 from his 32nd - floor room at Las Vegas ' Mandalay Bay hotel onto a crowd attending a music festival , killing 58 people and shooting and injuring 422 others ",0
More than 850 others suffered other injuries in the attack ,0
Investigators say Paddock died of an apparent self - inflicted gunshot wound ,0
Douglas Haig 's name was revealed in the release of search warrant records ,0
"Haig , 55 , appeared in court Friday and was released on his own recognizance with specific conditions not spelled out in court proceedings ",0
He is due in court again February 15 for a preliminary hearing ,0
"The maximum penalty for manufacturing illegal ammunition is five years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine ",0
"Haig 's attorney , Marc J. Victor , told CNN he had no comment ",0
"CNN affiliate KNXV caught up with Victor outside court , and the lawyer said he could n't say anything because of the ongoing case ",0
""""""""" My first obligation and only obligation is to my client , """""""" he told KNXV ",0
The complaint ,0
Haig was publicly linked to the Las Vegas investigation Tuesday when a judge unsealed months - old police search warrant records that named him as a person of interest ,0
"In a Friday morning news conference before his arrest , Haig , responding to the documents ' release , said he sold tracer ammunition to Paddock at his home in September after they met at a gun show ",0
"Tracer ammunition has a pyrotechnic charge that , when fired , leaves an illuminated trace that can help a shooter have a more precise idea of where the bullet is going ",0
Haig did not describe the ammunition as armor - piercing ,0
"Victor , at the same news conference at his Phoenix - area office , said the tracer ammunition that Haig sold Paddock """""""" was not modified in any way ... from manufacturer 's specs ",0
""""""""" ",0
"But in Friday 's criminal complaint , investigators say Haig and an associate also claimed they sold to Paddock other ammunition -- four or five 10-round packages of .308-caliber incendiary ammunition -- at a Las Vegas gun show in August ",0
It 's not clear from the complaint whether the two armor - piercing rounds with the incendiary capsule are from the packages Haig allegedly told investigators he sold Paddock at the gun show ,0
The complaint also does not say whether Paddock fired any of the ammunition that he bought from Haig ,0

"Two law enforcement sources told CNN in October that Paddock , during the massacre , fired incendiary bullets at a 43,000-barrel fuel tank on the grounds of nearby McCarran International Airport in what investigators believe was a failed attempt to cause an explosion ",0
Haig did not mention the incendiary rounds -- which are meant to ignite what they hit -- in Friday 's news conference ,1

The complaint does not name Haig 's associate ,0
The law enforcement sources also said tracer rounds were found in Paddock 's hotel room ,0
"But there was no evidence the tracer rounds were used during the attack , according to the sources , who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about such details ",0
Authorities have repeatedly said Paddock was the only shooter ,0
Friday 's charges do not allege that Haig knew of Paddock 's intentions to kill in Las Vegas ,0
Haig says he saw nothing suspicious ,0
"Haig , an aerospace engineer and part - time ammunition reseller , said at Friday 's news conference that he never saw anything suspicious in his brief interactions with Paddock ",0

• Paddock first approached Haig 's table at a Las Vegas gun show sometime last year but met another person who was behind the table ,0
"• Haig first met Paddock at a subsequent Phoenix gun show , where he was selling ammunition ",0
• Paddock took Haig 's business card because the seller did n't have the quantity of trace ammunition that he wanted ,0
• Paddock later called Haig three times to arrange a sale at Haig 's home ,0

A Dismal Record : Why Are They Destroying the Nuns ? ,0
"The meeting covered Carmels of the Teresian , Discalced , reform from Germany , five areas of Spain , three from France , Great Britain , Ireland , Italy , the Netherlands , Austria , Croatia and the Holy Land [ 1 ] ",0
"The reports from each region showed that many of the provisions found in Cor orans were already in place : federations with broad powers , including financial control and combined formation courses , “ religious assistant ” priests appointed by the federation and overseeing individual monasteries and superiors giving up their authority to the federations ",0
"Given that this was 2009 , it is clear that the plans to force all contemplative monasteries in the world into this disastrous European mould were well under way long before Pope Benedict was even considering resigning ",1
"Today I ’ve received an interesting document issued by the Carmelite Order in Europe following a meeting of the “ Federations of Discalced Carmelite Nuns of Europe & the Holy Land ” in Avila , February 2009 ",0
"As a snapshot of the current condition of Carmelite monastic life after it had been completely “ federated , ” it paints a depressing picture ; but as a demonstration of what “ federations ” are likely to achieve once Cor orans is implemented universally , it clangs in the mind like a funeral bell ",1
Reconciled to managed extinction ,0
"The report shows average ages of nuns between 65 and 80 , “ infirmary Carmels , ” nuns in state nursing homes , entire communities living in care facilities and half the Carmels with no one in formation ",0
"Solutions offered are equally uniform : heaped - up bureaucracy , common formation courses between monasteries developed by “ religious psychologists , ” ever more powers handed to federations ",0
This is federated Carmelite monastic life under Pope Francis’ New Paradigm of fully implemented VaticanTwoism ,0
Very little is said of any efforts being made to increase vocational outreach using the internet or through diocesan contacts ,0
"And perhaps most telling of all , not one word is offered of applying any systematic religious solutions ; no one is suggesting increased prayer or fasting , Rosary campaigns or novenas in what has to be the Carmelite Order ’s most desperate hour ",1
"Nothing is said of increased intensity of devotion to the charism , study of the foundress or returning to sources , still less of strengthening the Carmelites’ traditional independent self - governance or reconsidering the wisdom of “ the path taken ” ",1
"Indeed , in one case in Spain , the sisters themselves advocate abandoning traditional Teresian autonomy altogether ",0
The report from Great Britain notes : “ 18 Carmels have closed in the last 40 years ,0
There have been two amalgamations in recent years and another one involving three Carmels is in process ,0
Two communities at present are living together in one monastery as a temporary measure ,0
” ,0
The case of the Netherlands is downright bizarre ; sisters so old that even the federation structures are breaking down ,1
"Only one fully autonomous functioning Carmel still exists in the Netherlands , and the remains of four entire communities are living in a single care home run by religious brothers ",0
"But in this situation , the “ solution ” undertaken has been an elaborate bureaucratic reshuffle , including gaining approval from Rome , for “ a completely new structure , ” whose main task , no doubt , will be the making of funeral arrangements and disposing of library books ",0
"The atmosphere is weirdly resigned – one federation report recommended simply “ forgetting the numbers ” – with many notes of mutual congratulation over “ unity , ” the creating of “ links ” and the “ building of trust ” and “ dialogue ” between communities ",0
"The report from Belgium – federated in 1997 , average age 73 with one sister in formation for 11 monasteries – states tersely that their biggest problem is “ ageing ” but under “ possible solutions ” says only , “ We want to continue along the path we have begun ",0
” ,0
It is only in the report from Croatia where the problem changes abruptly from aging nuns and no vocations to too many vocations with not enough room[2 ] ,0
It is also notable that it is only in the Croatian report that Christ gets a direct mention ,0
"Federation of Croatia & Bosnia - Herzegovina : 82 nuns in 5 convents , with an average age of 47 , and eleven in formation ",0
"This outlier differs from the Western European federations in several respects , notably that it was only federated in 2002 ",0
"But the effects of the federating / formation courses are already being felt : “ Nowadays , two monasteries have difficulty because of a lack of vocations ",0
” ,0
Path taken : Have made a foundation in Albania ; however this community is not federated ,0
"From the beginning , our Association has organized formation courses for the younger sisters as well as courses of permanent formation ",0
"Each year , we have one or two seminars , which are also the occasion to the meeting of the Council of the Association ",0
The duration is 3 to 4 days and they take place every time in a different Monastery of the Association ,0
"We invite the sisters of other Carmelite convents friends to our formation courses : sisters from Albania , Slovenia and Bulgaria ",0
"Present Problems : In general , in our Association the vocations continue growing , but there are differences between the monasteries ",0
"Nowadays , two monasteries have difficulty because of a lack of vocations ",0
"Possible solutions : We do all what is in our hands in the area of the vocational promotion , collaborating in this way with Christ who calls by his Spirit ",0
These self - generated reports were made in response to a questionnaire set out for the meeting ,0
"All speak of nothing but bureaucratic responses : shared “ formation courses , ” meetings of superiors , amalgamations and suppression of houses and finally “ care homes ” and houses given over entirely as infirmaries ",0
"A tale of controlled , systematized extinction ",1

What has been done : 13 Dutch Carmels and one in Iceland have united in a Federation ,0
This has created a close communion from the beginning ,0
Everyone has collaborated in the process of amalgamations and suppressions ,0
Present Problems : Only one Carmel functions fully autonomously in the Netherlands ,0
4 communities are in a care - home run by the Brothers of the Immaculate Conception ,0
Another Carmel was renewed in 1990 ,0
At the original Carmel an infirmary wing has been added for those sisters who require nursing ; it is run by Franciscan sisters ,0
"With the passing of time the Assembly of the Federation has transferred tasks to the President of the Federation , according to the faculties described in the statutes , in particular regarding our mutual solidarity ",0
"Also , with the passing of the years , the Congregation for Religious has placed responsibility directly into the hands of the Council of the Federation ",0
"Finally , the autonomous Carmels have asked help from the Federation in order to protect their interests ",0
Due to our very advanced age in the Netherlands we have reached the moment when a General Assembly is no longer possible ,0
We are left with the problem that in the communities there are no sisters who can or who want to be prioresses or council sisters ,0
The structure of the Federation that we have had till now is thus no longer possible ,0
"Possible solutions : The Federation Council , the Religious Assistant , together with a canon lawyer of the Dutch Conference of Religious , have worked hard on a completely new structure , in which in its first draft the autonomy of the Carmel has been constantly kept in mind ",0
We began from three points : ,0
"1)Maintenance of the formal autonomy of the Carmels that still exist , but with the chance to transfer tasks gradually to the council of the Federation ",0
"2)Appointment of The Federal board or Federal Council of the Federation , preferably appointed by the Superior General ",0
"The team will consist of a president and vice - president who are members of one of the convents , appointed to functions , and of three people who are members , or not , of one of the convents ",0
"3)A Supervisory council , also to be appointed periodically by the Superior General , which will be made up of three members , whose president will be , preferably , a member of a religious institute , preferably of the Carmelite Order and appointed to functions ",0
This council sees itself as a supervisory body and to give advice that will more or less replace the Assembly of the Federation ,0
"In October 2008 , the President , the Religious Assistant and a Lawyer were in Rome where they explained the proposals ",0
They had meetings with Fr ,0
General and with the Congregation for Religious ,0
These were open meetings that helped us to clarify matters ,0
An important concern was that they would allow us to use lay people on the Federal Council of the Federation and the Supervisory council ,0
"We were aware that we were not dealing with a simple matter , but we think that , in view of our present situation today , we do not have much choice ",0
"It is important to continue to protect the interests of our Federation in the most responsible and careful way , so that all the sisters , even those advanced in years , can continue to live their life in Carmel ",0
Definitive permission came at the 25th of February ,0

"Given this incredible picture of a Carmelite Order in the last rattle of its death throes , the rest of the summaries of speeches given at the meeting in Avila read as outright surreal , leaving us to wonder if any of these people are attached in any way to reality ",1
Sr ,0
"Enrica Rosanna , the representative of the Vatican ’s Congregation for Religious told them that the “ two great challenges to our contemplative life ” are “ the challenge of globalization and the challenge of irrelevancy ",0
"” She warned the nuns against bringing vocations from other countries to keep their monasteries alive , dropping a hint about what now seems to be a particular obsession of the Congregation ",0
Cor orans would take this subject up definitively in 2018 : ,0
The nuns were exhorted to “ stay awake to welcome the dawn ” of a bright new future : ,0
"“ These are difficult and uncertain times , but it is also the time to stay awake as the new dawn is already announcing itself ",0
” “ Our aim must be to be open to the future ,0
We should not forget that we are following in the tradition of Teresa of Jesus and in the tradition of all those who have followed in her footsteps ,0
It is a wide road that opens up before us ,0
We must be women of hope and faith ,0
We must always believe that God is the one who directs history ,0
"From this derives our task , to be creative and , at the same time , faithful ( creative fidelity ) ",0
” [ emphasis in the original ,0
] ,0
"While there can be no doubt that the impending total extinction of the Carmelite Order in Western Europe was foremost in the minds of the nuns present , it seems that the issue was simply not addressed out loud by the representatives of the bureaucracy ",1
"Instead , Sr ",0
"Enrica , after this bizarre and cryptic comment , spoke of the “ problems and difficulties that we can encounter ” in discernment of mostly non - existent vocations , including “ consumerism , modern means of communication , difficulties in creating a stable personality , autonomy of the young , the need to be always supported , the ideology of subjectivism ",0
” ,0
What are these people smoking ? ,1
"Given that this was three years or more from the abdication of Benedict and the installation of the New Paradigm of Francis / Kasper , one wonders what this “ new dawn ” was actually about ",0
"Perhaps a useful question for one of the nuns present could have been , “ A ‘ new dawn’ of what , exactly ? ” This kind of coded language has been popular with the progressivist faction in the Church since the 1960s , when the expectation was for the installation of a totally new Church ",1
Was Sr ,0
Enrica somehow anticipating the fulfillment of those hippie - era dreams in the years to come ? ,0
It is certainly clear from Francis’ first acts as pope that he had dealing with conservative and Traditionalist nuns high on his list of priorities ,0
"His first appointment , no more than three weeks after the Conclave was Jose Rodrigues Carballo , the Religious Congregation ’s Secretary and – given the scandal that erupted on his leaving them – the financial wrecking ball of the Franciscan Friars Minor ",0
The first task Francis gave Carballo was the demolition of the Franciscan Friars of the Immaculate ,1
Certainly this record of the European Carmelites’ meeting is jammed with hints that Cor orans was on the way ,0
"On the final day of the meeting , the “ theme for the day ” was offered by then - Father General Luis Arostegui : “ Government : the need for change ",0
Autonomy and Association ; autonomy and Fr ,0
General ; other solutions to government ,0
” ,0
"The devolution of authority of superiors of individual monasteries to federations was obviously on someone ’s mind , as was a plan to see to it that monasteries change superiors frequently : “ Essential autonomy can fail due to the relationships within the community : abuses by permanent superiors who decide on the freedom and decisions of the community , ” the Father General warned ",0
And there were certainly hints that a general re - organisation of structures of authority was in the works ,0
"A common tactic of politicians who want to initiate changes is to “ ask questions ” rather than make suggestions , and Arostegui asked some very leading questions indeed in this closing address : ",0
“ Who discerns the existence or not of vital autonomy ; is it the community or chosen people ? ,0
“ Are there instances that work well within the Church which balance autonomy in a way that can be helpful in these situations ? ,0
“ At the time of St. Teresa she was an example of someone balanced ,0
"Stability is one reason [ for autonomy ] , but is stability understood in such a way that it can obstruct the spirit of mission and your availability to the Order and to the Church ? ",0
"“ The valiant and prophetic initiative of Pope Pius XII to create Associations and Federations opened up contemplative life , though it was also thought that it could harm cloister and autonomy ",0
Can such essential autonomy continue as it is ? ,0
“ 50 years ago there was stability ,0
How do we conceive today the relationship between autonomy and Federation - Association and between autonomy and Fr ,0
General ? ,0
“ Could there be other forms of government ? ” ,0
"Following the Father General ’s address are notes from the language groups , including the following : ",0
"“ While some communities do not want their autonomy to be touched , and have certain fears of ‘ external’ interference , others want a more moderate and flexible autonomy that , without going to the Congregation would have a juridical form , where the President with her Council can intervene in extreme cases that today we watch with pain , our hands tied ",0
"Though we want these legal channels to be established , it must remain clear what the limits of the Federation Council are , in order to avoid abuses of power on the part of the same ",0
” “ ... The absence of vital autonomy is also noticed when … the same person remains prioress for years ,0
” “ ... We need criteria that expand number 203 of our Constitutions and clarify vital autonomy ,0
We perceive that there is a shortage of authority figures ,0
"We do not want new figures but rather those that already exist ( Associations , [ federation ] Presidents , Provincials ... ) be empowered in a legal way ( canonically ) to help communities in difficulty , for the mission to discern , to counsel , to accompany ",0
"” “ ... We are also concerned for those communities not affiliated to Federations , we see that we should be close to them ",0
” ,0
"Maybe this summary document of 2009 can give us an idea what to expect from Rome in 2018 , now that the “ progressivist ” faction in the Vatican is in the ascendancy and is free to act without restriction ",0
"What comes clear comparing this document to Cor orans is that the Vatican ’s machinery has long been at work forcing a uniform and essentially bureaucratic , heavily authoritarian and legalistic vision of contemplative life on anyone who fails sufficiently to resist it ",0
And with the statistics offered at this meeting we can see clearly where this road leads ,0
So many Catholics in the last 40 years assumed that under the “ conservatives ” John Paul II and Benedict XVI at least the Vatican was “ onside ,0
” At least in Rome they understood the terrible threat of the Bolshie VaticanTwoist revolutionaries ,1
But this report of 2009 shows a clear picture of a Roman congregation determined to see the revolution through to its inevitable conclusion ,0

Kavanaugh and Last - Minute Accusations ,0
Democrats are pulling out all the stops and enabling salacious last - minute accusations against Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh in order to sink his candidacy ,1
"Now that Christine Blasey Ford has finally agreed to testify this Thursday at an open hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding her charge that Judge Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her at a long - ago high school party , these new charges have suddenly emerged from left field ",1
"On Sunday , a former classmate from Judge Kavanaugh 's time at Yale accused the Supreme Court nominee of exposing himself to her at a party ",0
"The New Yorker has just published an article written by Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer , based on information that was reportedly sent to at least four Democratic senators ",0
"The article recounted a claim by Deborah Ramirez , a Yale classmate of Brett Kavanaugh ’s , concerning “ a dormitory party gone awry ",0
"” As the article acknowledged , however , “ her memories contained gaps because she had been drinking at the time of the alleged incident ",0
"” The article goes on to say that in her initial conversations with The New Yorker , Ms. Ramirez was “ reluctant to characterize Kavanaugh ’s role in the alleged incident with certainty ",0
"” It was only after “ six days of carefully assessing her memories and consulting with her attorney ” that Ms. Ramirez was suddenly able to pinpoint Judge Kavanaugh as having committed an unsavory act , even though she admitted being “ foggy ” at the time ",0
The New Yorker article also noted that the magazine “ has not confirmed with other eyewitnesses that Kavanaugh was present at the party ,0
” ,0
"Meanwhile , the ever - present Michael Avenatti , attorney of porn star Stormy Daniels , tweeted that he had information from anonymous sources that Judge Kavanaugh and his friend had """""""" targeted """""""" women with drugs and alcohol at parties to facilitate """""""" gang rape ",0

Haters of Judge Kavanaugh are turning the process of Senate confirmation of a Supreme Court nominee into something worse than a travesty ,1
His opponents in the Senate have transformed their “ advise and consent ” function into a campaign of no - holds barred character assassination ,1
"While Judge Kavanaugh weathers these latest accusations , which he adamantly denies , his real test will be on Thursday , assuming that Christine Blasey Ford will follow through on her agreement to testify at an open hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee ",0
Her attorneys stalled for a week before making the announcement that Ms. Ford would testify despite certain “ unresolved ” issues ,0
"Among the issues Ms. Ford ’s attorneys have raised was the refusal of the committee to subpoena one of the purported witnesses , Mark Judge , who Ms. Ford reportedly claims was involved in the alleged incident , as well as “ who on the Majority side will be asking the questions , whether senators or staff attorneys ",0
""""""""" ",0
A week has already gone by since Ms. Ford went public with her story in an interview with the Washington Post while Ms. Ford and her attorneys stalled for time ,0
They raised one procedural issue after another while claiming that the committee majority was “ bullying ” Ms. Ford ,0
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley ( R - I ) has bent over backwards to accommodate Ms. Ford ’s preferred scheduling for her appearance ,1
He extended the deadline several times for her to come to a decision on whether to testify at all ,0
"He had offered various options for her to testify publicly or privately or to be interviewed by committee staff in her home state of California , whichever setting would make her more comfortable ",0
"However , in Senator Grassley ’s e - mail thanking Ms. Ford for finally agreeing to a time certain for her testimony , Senator Grassley correctly reminded her attorneys that “ the committee determines which witnesses to call , how many witnesses to call , and what order to call them and who will question them ",0
These are nonnegotiable ,0
” ,0
"While the negotiations with Ms. Ford ’s attorneys for her testimony were underway , Democrats were sitting on the latest allegations , ready to pounce as soon as Ms. Ford ’s accusation was about to be heard ",1
Some Democrats are already using the Ramirez episode to push anew for a fresh FBI investigation and to postpone Thursday ’s scheduled hearing ,0
"Ideally , if the Democrats can not apply enough pressure to force a withdrawal of Judge Kavanaugh ’s nomination through their relentless campaign of character assassination , they want to push any Senate votes until after the midterm elections at the earliest ",1
Then they will claim that the newly elected senators should be involved in the confirmation decision ,0
"In the meantime , Judge Kavanaugh ’s adversaries in the Senate , the mainstream media and progressive circles continue to bludgeon Judge Kavanaugh in the court of public opinion ",1
All of their stratagems are an obvious attempt to buy time in order to persuade any wavering senators that Judge Kavanaugh is too tainted by sexual assault charges – whether proven or not - to sit on the Supreme Court ,0
Proof does not matter to those wanting to bring Judge Kavanaugh down at any cost ,0
"Regarding Ms. Ford ’s accusation , they know that the proof so far is non - existent , aside from Ms. Ford ’s own assertions contained in her confidential letter given to Senator Dianne Feinstein , the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee , last July , and in her Washington Post interview ",0
"While a redacted version of Ms. Ford ’s letter has been published , Senator Feinstein has refused to date to give even Senator Grassley a copy of the completely unredacted version ",0
"The FBI has already conducted 6 background checks , no federal crime is alleged , and there is no forensic evidence to investigate after 30 years at a site that Ms. Ford can not even identify ",0
What we do know so far tends to undercut the credibility of Ms. Ford ’s accusation ,1
Ms. Ford can not corroborate her decades - old charge of sexual assault against Judge Kavanaugh ,0
Whatever corroboration Ms. Ford was hoping for from “ witnesses ” she claimed were at the alleged party is non - existent ,1
The individuals she reportedly named in her unredacted confidential letter given to Senator Feinstein have either denied being at such a party or do not recollect what Ms. Ford has alleged ,0
"Moreover , by her own admission to the Washington Post , Ms. Ford “ said she does not remember some key details of the incident ",0
"” She does not remember , for example , where it happened , how the party came together in the first place , or how she got home after the alleged incident ",0
"She believes the alleged incident occurred during the summer of 1982 , but reportedly could not be more precise on the day or even the month of the party ",0
"Afraid that Ms. Ford ’s sexual assault allegation could be readily challenged and anxious to establish some sort of pattern of sexual misconduct beyond this single alleged incident , the Kavanaugh haters have latched onto Ms. Ramirez ’s story ",1
"The New York Times published an op - ed column last week by a psychiatrist , Richard A. Friedman , who cited neurological science to conclude that Ms. Ford ’s claim that she has “ a vivid memory of an attack that took place when she was 15 ” is “ credible ",0
"” The reason , he wrote , is that “ memories formed under the influence of intense emotion — such as the feelings that accompany a sexual assault — are indelible in the way that memories of a routine day are not ",0
” The only problem with Dr. Friedman ’s thesis is that Ms. Ford has apparently forgotten such key details surrounding the alleged sexual assault as when and where it happened and how she got home ,1
"Moreover , when Ms. Ford finally told someone about the incident in any detail some 30 years later in 2012 , during a couples therapy session with her husband , she did not name Judge Kavanaugh specifically , according to the therapist ’s notes that Ms. Ford had provided to the Washington Post in connection with her interview ",0
The Washington Post reported that the therapist ’s notes it reviewed “ do not mention Kavanaugh ’s name but say she reported that she was attacked by students ‘ from an elitist boys’ school’ who went on to become ‘ highly respected and high - ranking members of society in Washington.’ ” ,1
Ms. Ramirez ’s story is even less credible ,0
It took an attorney and six days of very belated reflection to help revive her memory of an incident she claimed happened while she herself was very drunk ,0
"Senator Mazie Hirono ( D - Hawaii ) , one of Judge Kavanaugh ’s fiercest critics who told men to “ shut up ” regarding Ms. Ford ’s allegations , said she doubts Judge Kavanaugh ’s credibility because of “ how he approaches his cases ",1
"” Aside from mischaracterizing the constitutional textualist reasoning underlying Judge Kavanaugh ’s opinions , she is saying that she does not believe Judge Kavanaugh ’s denial of the sexual misconduct allegations lodged against him because of the opinions he wrote that she does not like ",0
Such circular “ reasoning ” would be amusing if it were not so emblematic of what one writer called “ Kavanaugh Derangement Syndrome ,1
""""""""" ",0
Senator Kirsten Gillibrand ( D - N.Y. ) is also suffering from the same syndrome ,0
"She said Thursday regarding Ms. Ford : """""""" I believe her because she is telling the truth and you know it by her story ",1
""""""""" ",0
"Ms. Ford ’s supporters are exploiting the “ Me Too ” movement to declare Judge Kavanaugh guilty simply because Ms. Ford is a woman who has made what they call , without any corroborating evidence to date , a “ credible ” charge ",1
The same would presumably be the case for Ms. Ramirez ,0
"They argue that since the Senate Judiciary Committee is not a criminal judicial trial , but rather a legislative hearing for confirmation of a Supreme Court nominee , the normal burden of proof shouldered by the accuser should not apply ",0
"Judge Kavanaugh should have to prove that he is not guilty , they are in effect insisting ",0
This is another case of Kavanaugh Derangement Syndrome ,1
Let ’s assume for the sake of argument that the normal burden on the prosecution in a criminal case - to prove the accused ’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt - is not applicable regarding the charge against Judge Kavanaugh since he is not a defendant in a criminal trial ,0
"However , that should not flip the burden of proof onto Judge Kavanaugh altogether ",0
Judge Kavanaugh is being subjected to charges of a criminal nature that could not only deprive him of a seat on the Supreme Court for which he is otherwise eminently qualified ,0
"Ms. Ford ’s unsubstantiated accusation can completely destroy Judge Kavanaugh ’s life by causing irreparable damage to his reputation for integrity and good character and to his career , which he has built up during decades of public service ",1
His family ’s lives have been completely upended ,0
"Placing the burden on Judge Kavanaugh to prove that he was not involved in an uncorroborated incident from years ago , about which even his accuser does not recall key details , turns the fundamental constitutional principle of due process upside down ",1
Ms. Ford should have the burden to prove her accusations by at least a preponderance of all the evidence presented ,0
This charade must come to an end ,1
No more extensions for Ms. Ford to come forward and testify ,0
"If Ms. Ford does not follow through with her agreement to testify in an open Senate Judiciary Committee hearing this Thursday and do so upon the conditions set by the committee , she should go home while the committee proceeds to an immediate vote on Judge Kavanaugh ’s nomination ",0
"If Ms. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh do testify , the senators deciding on whether to confirm Judge Kavanaugh as well as the American public following the testimony must remember one cardinal rule ",0
"In a nation guided by fairness and law , a person is innocent until proven guilty ",1
"Sadly , many of Judge Kavanaugh ’s haters have thrown that rule aside ",1
"If Judge Kavanaugh ’s nomination is pulled as a result of the smears and character assassination , President Trump should immediately nominate someone on his short list such as Amy Coney Barrett and the Senate Republican majority should then push through the new nominee ’s confirmation as soon as possible ",1

Here ’s the crux of Greenwald ’s argument : ,0
So let me just make two points ,0
"Number one is , if you look at President Obama versus President Trump , there ’s no question that President Obama was more cooperative with and collaborative with Russia and the Russian agenda than President Trump ",0
President Trump has sent lethal arms to Ukraine — a crucial issue for Putin — which President Obama refused to do ,1
"President Trump has bombed the Assad forces in Syria , a client state of Putin , something that Obama refused to do because he did n’t want to provoke Putin ",0
Trump has expelled more Russian diplomats and sanctioned more Russian oligarchs than [ Obama ] has ,1
"Trump undid the Iran deal , which Russia favored , while Obama worked with Russia in order to do the Iran deal ",0
"So this idea that Trump is some kind of a puppet of Putin , that he controls him with blackmail , is the kind of stuff that you believe if you read too many ",1
Tom Clancy novels but is n’t borne out by the facts ,0
"The other issue that I want to make is that , you know , again , this idea that somehow that you are endorsing the repression of other countries’ leaders if you meet with them — it is true that Trump has never criticized Putin , although he has taken all the steps I just outlined against Putin ",0
But he ’s also never criticized Benjamin Netanyahu ,1
He ’s also never criticized the incredibly repressive leaders of Saudi Arabia ,1
He ’s never criticized the fascist president of the Philippines ,1
"It is true President Trump likes fascist and authoritarian leaders , and that is a problem , but it ’s not like Putin is the only leader that he does n’t criticize ",0

"Trump Orders Declassification Of ‘ Russian Probe’ Documents , Including Texts ",0
President Donald Trump ordered the feds to declassify documents relating the Russian election meddling investigation yesterday ,1
Among the documents to be declassified are all of the text messages between disgraced FBI figures Peter Strzok and Lisa Page ,1
The documents to be declassified include all FBI reports on interviews with Justice Department official Bruce Ohr and all FBI reports of interviews prepared in connection with all other applications to surveil Carter Page ,0
"Trump also asked that other important documents be declassified as well , including 21 pages worth of an application for a renewed surveillance warrant against former campaign aide Carter Page , according to Fox News ",0
The 21 pages Trump wants to be declassified only make up a small part of the 412 pages of FISA applications and warrants related to Page released by the FBI earlier this year in heavily redacted format ,0
The June 2017 application was the last of four filed by the Justice Department in support of FISA court orders allowing the monitoring of Page for nearly a year ,0
"According to the redacted version as reported by Fox News , three of the declassified pages contain information included in a section titled “ The Russian Government ’s Coordinated Efforts to Influence the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election ",0
” That section includes reference to the potential coordination between people associated with Trump ’s campaign and the alleged Russian election interference effort ,0
"White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said President Trump had ordered the documents released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence ( ODNI ) and the Justice Department “ [ a]t the request of a number of committees of Congress , and for reasons of transparency ",0
” ,0
"The text messages are to be released “ without redaction , ” and those include messages from Ohr , Strzok , Lisa Page , former FBI Director James Comey , and former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe ",0
Carter Page told Fox News’ Sean Hannity on Monday night that the FBI ’s investigation was “ so incredibly stupid to begin with ,1
"” He added , “ My biggest concern is all the damage that this did to the U.S. government [ and ] the mockery it made out of the Constitution and all of the wrongdoing that was done by various officials within the Department of Justice , the FBI and the DNC [ Democratic National Committee ] ",1
” ,0
"It is so far unknown when these documents will be declassified in an unredacted version , but it is safe to say that Democrats are probably panicking right about now ",1
"Fox News further reported that a source familiar with the timing of the declassification told the media outlet that they expected the Carter Page warrant application to be declassified first , followed by the FBI reports on agent interviews with Ohr ",0
A Justice Department spokesperson told Fox News that the DOJ and FBI “ are already working with the Director of National Intelligence to comply with the President ’s order ,0

North Korea was right on target when it accused arch - neocon John Bolton of trying to sabotage the peace deal ,0

"In the 2005 - 2006 period , after years of negotiations , the US and North Korea were close to a nuclear / peace deal ",0
Enter John Bolton ,0
He succeeded in sabotaging the US - North Korea deal ,0
Why ? ,0
"Because Bolton , as an arch neocon , was fanatically pro - Israel and feared that North Korea might provide nuclear technology to Israel ’s foes ",1
"As usual with the neocons , Israel ’s interests came before those of the United States ",0
"Trump ’s newly named Secretary of State , Michael Pompeo , is also an ardent neocon ",0
"Last week , Bolton went onto US TV and actually suggested North Korea might follow the course set by Libya , of all places ",0
"Libya ’s then ruler , Muammar Kadaffi , bought some nuclear equipment from Pakistan so he could hand it over to the US as a gesture of cooperation after the Bush administration invaded Iraq ",0

Pilger ’s Statement ,0
“ There is a silence among many who call themselves left ,0
The silence is Julian Assange ,0
"As every false accusation has fallen away , every bogus smear shown to be the work of political enemies , Julian stands vindicated as one who has exposed a system that threatens humanity ",1
"The Collateral Damage video , the war logs of Afghanistan and Iraq , the Cablegate revelations , the Venezuela revelations , the Podesta email revelations … these are just a few of the storms of raw truth that have blown through the capitals of rapacious power ",1

"Dennis Bernstein : We continue our discussion of the case of Julian Assange , now in the Ecuadorian embassy in Great Britain ",0
"John Pilger , it is great to talk to you again ",0
"But it is a profound tragedy , John , the way they are treating Julian Assange , this prolific journalist and publisher who so many other journalists have depended on in the past ",1
He has been totally left out in the cold to fend for himself ,1
John Pilger : I have never known anything like it ,0
There is a kind of eerie silence around the Julian Assange case ,1
Julian has been vindicated in every possible way and yet he is isolated as few people are these days ,0
"He is cut off from the very tools of his trade , visitors are n’t allowed ",0
"I was in London recently and I could n’t see him , although I spoke to people who had seen him ",0
"Rafael Correa , the former president of Ecuador , said recently that he regarded what they are doing to Julian now as torture ",1
"It was Correa ’s government that gave Julian political refuge , which has been betrayed now by his successor , the government led by Lenin Moreno , which is back to sucking up to the United States in the time - honored way , with Julian as the pawn and victim ",1
Should be a ‘ Constitutional Hero’ ,1
But really it comes down to the British government ,0
"Although he is still in a foreign embassy and actually has Ecuadorian nationality , his right of passage out of that embassy should be guaranteed by the British government ",0
The United Nations Working Party on Unlawful Detentions has made that clear ,0
Britain took part in an investigation which determined that Julian was a political refugee and that a great miscarriage of justice had been imposed on him ,1
"It is very good that you are doing this , Dennis , because even in the media outside the mainstream , there is this silence about Julian ",0
"The streets outside the embassy are virtually empty , whereas they should be full of people saying that we are with you ",1
The principles involved in this case are absolutely clear - cut ,1
Number one is justice ,0
"The injustice done to this man is legion , both in terms of the bogus Swedish case and now the fact that he must remain in the embassy and ca n’t leave without being arrested , extradited to the United States and ending up in a hell hole ",1
"But it is also about freedom of speech , about our right to know , which is enshrined in the United States Constitution ",1
"If the Constitution were taken literally , Julian would be a constitutional hero , actually ",1
"Instead , I understand the indictment they are trying to concoct reads like a charge of espionage ! ",0
It ’s so ridiculous ,1
"That is the situation as I see it , Dennis ",0
It is not a happy one but it is one that people should rally to quickly ,0
DB : His journalistic brethren are sounding like his prosecutors ,1
"They want to get behind Russia - gate freaks like Congressman Adam Schiff and Mike Pompeo , who would like to see Assange in jail forever or even executed ",1

This is a terrible time for journalism ,0
JP : You are absolutely right : It is a terrible time for journalism ,0
I have never known anything quite like it in my career ,1

The Pulitzer Prize this year was awarded to The New York Times and The Washington Post for witch - hunting around Russia - gate ! ,1
They were praised for “ how deeply sourced their investigations were ,0

Like Webb ,0
The Julian Assange case reminds me of the Gary Webb case ,0
Bob Parry was one of Gary Webb ’s few supporters in the media ,0
Webb ’s “ Dark Alliance ” series contained evidence that cocaine trafficking was going on with the connivance of the CIA ,0
"Later Webb was hounded by fellow journalists and , unable to find work , he eventually committed suicide ",1
The CIA Inspector General subsequently vindicated him ,0
"Now , Julian Assange is a long way from taking his own life ",0
His resilience is remarkable ,0
But he is still a human being and he has taken such a battering ,1
"Probably the hardest thing for him to take is the utter hypocrisy of news organizations — like The New York Times , which published the WikiLeaks “ War Logs ” and “ Cablegate , ” The Washington Post and The Guardian , which has taken a vindictive delight in tormenting Julian ",1
The Guardian a few years ago got a Pulitzer Prize writing about Snowden ,0
But their coverage of Snowden left him in Hong Kong ,0
It was WikiLeaks that got Snowden out of Hong Kong and to safety ,0
"Professionally , I find this one of the most unsavory and immoral things I have seen in my career ",1
The persecution of this man by huge media organizations which have drawn great benefit from WikiLeaks ,0
"One of Assange ’s great tormentors , The Guardian‘s Luke Harding , made a great deal of money with a Hollywood version of a book that he and David Lee wrote in which they basically attacked their source ",1
I suppose you have to be a psychiatrist to understand all of this ,0
My understanding is that so many of these journalists are shamed ,0
"They realize that WikiLeaks has done what they should have done a long time ago , and that is to tell us how governments lie ",0
"DB : One thing that disturbs me greatly is the way in which the Western corporate press speculate about Russian involvement in the U.S. 2016 election , that it was a hack through Julian Assange ",1
Any serious investigator would want to know who would be motivated ,0
And yet the possibility that it might be the dozen or so pissed - off people who went to work for the Clinton machine and learned from the inside that the DNC was all about getting rid of Bernie Sanders … this is not a part of the story ! ,1
Eight Hundred Thousand Disclosures on Russia ,0
"JP : What happened to Sanders and the way that he was rolled by the Clinton organization , everybody knows that this is the story ",1
And now we have the DNC suing WikiLeaks ! ,0
There ’s a kind of farcical element to this ,1
"I mean , none of this came from the Russians ",0
That WikiLeaks is somehow in bed with the Russians is ludicrous ,1
"WikiLeaks published about 800,000 major disclosures about Russia , some of them extremely critical of the Russian government ",1
"If you are a government and you are doing something untoward or you are lying to your people and WikiLeaks gets the documents to show it , they will publish no matter who you are , be they the United States or Russia ",0
"DB : Randy Credico , because of his work and his decision to devote a very high - profile series to the persecution of Julian Assange , recently found himself under attack ",0
"He went to the White House Press Roast and , after having a nice discussion with Congressman Schiff , he yelled out “ What about Julian Assange ? ” The room was packed full of reporters but Randy was attacked and dragged out ",1
It was if everyone there was embarrassed to recognize that one of their brethren was being brutalized ,1
JP : Randy shouted some truth ,0
It is very similar to what happened to Ray McGovern ,0
Ray is a former member of the CIA but extremely principled ,0
I might suggest he is a renegade now ,1
"DB : It was hysterical to watch these four armed guards who kept shouting “ Stop resisting , stop resisting ! ” and they are beating the hell out of him ! ",1
JP : I thought the image of Ray being hauled off was particularly telling ,1
"These four overweight , obviously ill - trained young men manhandling Ray , who is 78 years old ",1
There was something highly emblematic about that for me ,0
He stood up to challenge the fact that the CIA was about to hand over leadership to a person who had been in charge of torture ,0
"It is both shocking and surreal , which of course the Julian Assange case is as well ",1
But real journalism should be able to get through the shocking and the surreal and get to the truth ,1
"There is so much collusion now , with all these dark and menacing developments ",1
It is almost as if the word “ journalism ” is becoming blighted ,1
DB : There has certainly been a lot of collusion when it comes to Israel ,0
Then the word “ collusion ” is quite appropriate ,0
JP : That ’s the ultimate collusion ,0
But that ’s collusion with silence ,1
Never has there been a collusion like the one between the U.S. and Israel ,1
It suggests another word and that is “ immunity ,0
"” It has a moral immunity , a cultural immunity , a geopolitical immunity , a legal immunity , and certainly a media immunity ",1
We see the gunning down of over 60 people on the day of the inauguration of the new U.S. embassy in Jerusalem ,1
Israel has some of the most wickedly experimental munitions in the world and they fired them at people who were protesting the occupation of their homeland and trying to remind people of the Nakba and the right of return ,1
In the media these were described as “ clashes ,0
” Although they did become so bad that The New York Times in a later edition changed its front page headline to say that Israel was actually killing people ,0
"A rare moment , indeed , when the immunity , the collusion was interrupted ",0
All the talk of Iran and nuclear weapons is without any reference to the biggest nuclear power in the Middle East ,1
DB : What would you say have been the contributions that Julian Assange has made in this age of censorship and cowardice in journalism ? ,1
Where does he come into the picture ? ,0
JP : I think it comes down to information ,0
"If you go back to when WikiLeaks started , when Julian was sitting in his hotel room in Paris beginning to put the whole thing together , one of the first things he wrote was that there is a morality in transparency , that we have a right to know what those who wish to control our lives are doing in secret ",0
The right to know what governments are doing in our name — on our behalf or to our detriment — is our moral right ,0
Julian feels very passionately about this ,0
There were times when he could have compromised slightly in order to possibly help his situation ,0
"There were times when I said to him , “ Why do n’t you just suspend that for a while and go along with it ? ” Of course , I knew beforehand what his answer would be and that was “ no ",0
"” The enormous amount of information that has come from WikiLeaks , particularly in recent years , has amounted to an extraordinary public service ",1
I was reading just the other day a 2006 WikiLeaks cable from the U.S. embassy in Caracas which was addressed to other agencies in the region ,0
This was four years after the U.S. tried to get rid of Chavez in a coup ,0
It detailed how subversion should work ,0
"Of course , they dressed it up as human rights work and so on ",1
I was reading this official document thinking how the information contained in it was worth years of the kind of distorted reporting from Venezuela ,0
It also reminds us that so - called “ meddling ” by Russia in the U.S. is just nonsense ,0
The word “ meddling ” does n’t apply to the kind of action implied in this document ,0
It is intervention in another country ’s affairs ,0
WikiLeaks has done that all over the world ,0
It has given people the information they have a right to have ,0
They had a right to find out from the so - called “ War Logs ” the criminality of our wars in Afghanistan and Iraq ,0
They had a right to find out about Cablegate ,1
"That ’s when , on Clinton ’s watch , we learned that the NSA was gathering personal information on members of the United Nations Security Council , including their credit card numbers ",0
You can see why Julian made enemies ,0
But he should also have made a huge number of friends ,0
This is critical information because it tells us how power works and we will never learn about it otherwise ,0
I think WikiLeaks has opened a world of transparency and put flesh on the expression “ right to know ,1
"” This must explain why he is attacked so much , because that is so threatening ",0
"The enemy to great power is not the likes of the Taliban , it is us ",1
DB : And who can forget the release of the “ collateral murder ” footage by Chelsea Manning ? ,0
JP : That kind of thing is not uncommon ,0
Vietnam was meant to be the open war but really it was n’t ,0
There were n’t the cameras around ,0
"It is indeed shocking information but it informs people , and we have Chelsea Manning ’s courage to thank for that ",1
"DB : Yes , and the thanks he got was seven years in solitary confinement ",0
"They want to prosecute Assange and maybe hang him from the rafters in Congress , but what about Judith Miller and The New York Times lying the West into war ? ",1
"There is no end of horrific examples of what passes for journalism , in contrast to the amazing contribution that Julian Assange has made ",1

"They flank us by sending heretics like Arius , Luther , and Hans Kung ",0
"Today , there ’s also a fifth column working to tear down the walls from within – not only pedophiles like John Geoghan , but also predators like Theodore McCarrick ",1
Where did those fifth columnists enter ? ,0
"Why , there ’s only one possible explanation : the Second Vatican Council ",1
Aggiornamento sounds like a Lefebvrist slur ,0
The idea that an ecumenical council of the Catholic Church would openly seek to “ bring itself up to date ” is ridiculous ,0
Yet that was precisely the aim ,0
"As St Pope John XXIII explained , “ Its principal task will be concerned with the conditions and modernization of the Church after 20 centuries of life ",0
” It was not supposed ( as some have claimed ) to simply update the liturgy from its last redesign in 1570 ,0
"The goal was to align the Church more with modern world : a world defined , to a considerable extent , by its rejection of the Catholic world that flourished before the Protestant Reformation and French Revolution ",0
"Now , I do n’t believe Pope John saw himself as endangering either orthodoxy or sacred , immutable tradition ",0
I share Pope Paul IV ’s view ,0
"When he heard that the Council was being convened , then - Cardinal Montini is supposed to have sighed , “ This holy old boy does n’t realise what a hornet ’s nest he ’s stirring up ",1
” ,0
"Nonetheless , he stirred it ",0
The spirit of aggiornamento quickly spread through the Church in the 1960s – and the seminaries especially ,0
Seminarians called for a more “ participatory ” administration ,0
They became involved in socialist politics ,0
They formed trade unions to demand the right to marry ,0
They practiced sauvage intercommunion ,0
"Of course , they had their enablers in the hierarchy as well ",0
"Perhaps the worst was Archbishop Marty of Paris , a leader of the “ priest - worker movement ” who defended Marxist and existentialist atheisms on the floor of the Council ",0
"During a homily at the Cathedral , he also praised the soixantehuitards : “ the great outburst of the younger generation that suddenly wanted to take its place in life ” that occurred in his city in May of 1968 ",0
"“ One also felt that , in these events of May , ” Marty continued , “ the seriousness of the working class , which wants not only to earn a living wage , but also to find its freedom , its independence ",0
"” Theaggiornamentistas was never purged from the Church , and certainly not from the seminaries ",0
"As the modern world continued to reject traditional Christian mores , so too does the Church seem increasingly “ out of step ” and in need of “ modernizing ” ",0
"Inevitably , this came to mean the acceptance of homosexuality ",0
"Bishop Wilton D. Gregory , as president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops , infamously spoke of “ an ongoing struggle to make sure that the Catholic priesthood is not dominated by homosexual men ",0
” ,0
But that predominance has very little to do with homosexuality per se ,0
"Rather , the 1960s rejection of celibacy in the seminaries naturally provided more ( shall we say ) opportunities for gay men – given that there are , of course , no women in Catholic seminaries ",0
"This began driving away heterosexuals , as well as homosexuals who upheld the Church ’s teachings on chastity and celibacy ",0
"Needless to say , not all gay priests are violent predators like McCarrick ",1
But the toleration of sexually active priests gave McCarrick cover to “ seduce ” his victims ,0
"Many have also speculated that , because McCarrick ’s victims were overwhelmingly above the age of consent , the media did n’t consider them newsworthy ",0
"If he ’d fondled a 12-year old altar boy , that would have been one thing ",0
Pedophile priests sell papers ,1
But taking an 18-year - old seminarian to bed ? ,0
"Running that story would simply be outing a closeted gay man : an act the liberal press would no doubt consider “ homophobic ” , as Ross Douthat pointed out ",1
"Meanwhile , those bishops who did n’t approve of his actions knew the culture – both within the Church and without her – were against them ",0
The post - Vatican Church does n’t like to come off as a nag ,0
She ’s not going to cause a fuss by purging sexually active gay men from the clergy just because … what ? ,0
It ’s immoral ? ,0
That ’s not very aggiornamentistic ! ,0
"The world and our worldly bishops were , unsurprisingly , of one mind ",0
"And even if they were disgusted by McCarrick , these prelates were n’t willing to jeopardize their careers by standing for justice against vice ",0
We seem to be slouching back to the old traditionalist trope : All the Church ’s problems would be solved if we ’d just go back to the Latin Mass. ,0
Something went critically wrong during Vatican II that extends well beyond the Mass. ,1
And we ca n’t drag the Church out of her present crisis until we have the courage to brave accusations of “ Lefebvrism ” and say so ,0
Those who love our Holy Mother – those who want to protect her boys and men from all the McCarricks and their perverse appetites – must n’t be deceived into thinking this is a small or an isolated issue ,1
It is n’t ,0
"This is the crisis of an ancient and immortal institution trying desperately to seem young and fashionable ; like all old men , it only manages to come across as lecherous and pathetic ",1
Its obsession with “ modernization ” leads it to only adopt the vices of modernity ,0
"Instead of serving as ambassadors from the City of God , far too many of our priests and prelates have become agents of the City of Man ",0
I do n’t know what it will take to set things right ,0
I do n’t know what it will take to exorcise the “ spirit of Vatican II ” – the spirit of aggiornamento – from the Church ,1
But we will ,1
Christ promised ,0
"The Las Vegas Security Guard Credited With Finding Shooter , Mysteriously Vanished Into Thin Air ",1
"By now , we have all heard of Jesus Campos ",0
"He ’s the heroic security guard that allegedly located the Las Vegas shooter , Steven Paddock ",0
"But the narrative surrounding him has changed wildly since the authorities mentioned him , and now , he ’s mysteriously vanished into thin air ",1
"Of course , this leads many to believe that Campos did n’t even exist , to begin with ",0
His mere existence appears to have been fabricated by the very authorities who are cramming lies down our throats about this massacre for the sake of political agendas ,1
"There are two conflicting timelines of Campos ’s injury , but what the media has so far made clear , is that they want the public to believe Campos was walking down the Mandalay Bay Hotel & Casino ’s 32nd floor hallway , when Stephen Paddock spotted him on a camera he ’d allegedly set up in a room service cart , just outside his suite ",1
"Once he saw Campos , Paddock reportedly fired nearly 200 rounds through his suite door , wounding Campos in the leg ",0
"Moments later ( 6 minutes actually , according to the newly revised timeline regarding Campos ) Paddock allegedly opened fire on a crowd killing more than 50 and injuring nearly 500 ",0
But Campos has been a mysterious subject since being wounded in the first moments of Paddock ’s assault ,0
"After speaking to hotel and law enforcement officials , Campos was scheduled to appear on local Las Vegas television for an interview but went missing just moments before he was supposed to be on the air ",0
"David Hickey , a spokesman for the Security , Police , and Fire Professionals of America ( SPFPA ) , Campos ’s union , said he got a text that Campos had been taken to an urgent care facility , UMC Quick Care ",0
"But UMC Quick Care says none of their clinics filled out an intake request for a patient by that name , and Campos has been silent since the text ; vanishing into thin air ",1
He also is n’t listed on the registry that shows the names of licensed security guards in Nevada ,0
"“ Right now I ’m just concerned where my member is , and what his condition is ",0
"It ’s highly unusual , ” Hickey told media ",0
"“ I ’m hoping everything is OK with him and I ’m sure MGM or the union will let ( media ) know when we hear something , ” he said ",0
"In the meantime , authorities still have not released a conclusive timeline for the shooting they desperately want us to believe was committed by Paddock ",1
"And , according to the latest reports , are still looking for a motive for the shooting ",0

"According to this Supreme Court nominee , he thinks it is just fine and dandy for police and government to track you , spy on you , and dig through your personal life — without a warrant ",1
"On multiple occasions , Kavanaugh has been the lone voice when it comes supporting the state ’s rights to warrantlessly spy on its citizens ",0
"As Reason points out , in 2010 he dissented from the D.C. Circuit ’s decision not to rehear a case in which a three - judge panel had ruled that police violated a suspected drug dealer ’s Fourth Amendment rights when they tracked his movements for a month by attaching a GPS device to his car without a warrant ",0
Kavanaugh claimed that putting a GPS tracking device on a person ’s car without first obtaining a warrant was just fine because it did n’t constitute a “ search ” as defined by the Fourth Amendment ,0
"To Kavanaugh , bypassing the courts and tracking an individual without their consent is “ constitutional ",0
"” In this line of thinking , the Fourth Amendment is not violated even if police trespass on someone ’s physical property , or track someone ’s cell phone ",0
"Luckily , he was the only judge on the panel to think this ",0
"In June , the Supreme Court ruled specifically on this case noting that collecting such information actually does constitute a search and therefore requires a warrant ",0
But it gets worse ,0
"In 2015 , Kavanaugh issued a statement strongly defending the NSA ’s phone metadata collection program , arguing that it is “ entirely consistent with the Fourth Amendment ",0
"” To Kavanaugh , sweeping programs that collect information from innocent citizens’ phones are not in conflict with having the right to be free from unlawful search and seizure ",0
Seriously ,1
"According to Kavanaugh , the Fourth Amendment allows for searches “ without individualized suspicion ” when the government demonstrates a “ special need ” that “ outweighs the intrusion on individual liberty ",0
” ,0
Exactly what this “ special need ” is that can constitute a Gestapo like police state surveilling its own citizens is a moving target that has already been proven to be abused over and over again ,1
"“ The sacrifice of our personal liberty for security is and will forever be a false choice , ” Senator Rand Paul said of Kavanaugh ’s views on the disposable nature of the constitution ",0
"Kavanaugh “ has no qualms about applying decades - old case law to the digital age , and he has endorsed the idea of a “ counterterrorism exception ” to the Fourth Amendment ’s warrant requirement , ” said Liza Goitein , co - director of the Brennan Center for Justice ’s Liberty and National Security Program ",0
"While the left is calling for Kavanaugh to be executed over the sex abuse allegations and the right is attacking the alleged victims , others in Congress who see through the facade and media distraction are trying to draw attention to the fact that Kavanaugh is a champion of the police and surveillance state and an enemy to privacy ",1
Representative Justin Amash does not have a vote on whether or not Kavanaugh will be appointed ,0
"However , this has n’t prevented him from becoming the only Republican to speak out against the real reasons he should not be appointed to Supreme Court ",0
"“ Privacy advocates must fight , ” Amash tweeted ",1
"“ There are many potential nominees with a conservative record on abortion , guns , and regulations ",0
"The only question is will the Senate confirm one who is really bad on the # 4thAmendment , when so much is at stake in upcoming digital privacy battles ",1
” ,0
"Indeed , as technology increases , so does the desire of the state to use it to spy on us ",0
The cases headed to the supreme court in the future over what constitutes an unconstitutional search will undoubtedly be vast in number and detrimental in deciding how much freedom and privacy Americans get to keep ,0
"As for if Kavanaugh gets appointed , Amash has some harsh words to those who are blindly supporting him based on party lines : ",1
"“ When Kavanaugh is on the Supreme Court , undermining our # 4thAmendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures , it will be too late for others to join me ",1

The police quickly intervened to save the victim who lodged a complaint ,0
"The anti - Semitic attacker was arrested and placed in police custody and then transferred to the psychiatric infirmary , on the recommendation of the doctor because of his observed state of excitement ",0
It 's okay ,0
Getting really excited about Jews is a common problem among Muslim settlers in France ,1
"Earlier this month , the suspect in the alleged murder of a Jewish physician in Paris was deemed not responsible for his actions in a second psychiatric evaluation ordered by a judge even though the defense did not request it ",0
"The suspect , Traore Kobili , is scheduled to have a third evaluation to determine his ability to stand trial for the murder of Sarah Halimi in April 2017 ",0

"Congressman : """""""" Credible Evidence """""""" Of “ Terrorist Infiltration Through the Southern Border ” Related To Las Vegas Shooting ",0

"Now , a congressman is saying there is """""""" credible evidence """""""" of """""""" terrorist infiltration through the southern border """""""" that is related to the Las Vegas shooting ",1
"If you recall , the Islamic State has never claimed responsibility for attacks they were not involved in ",0
Here are just a few of those claims ,0
"In Naba 100 # ISIS featured an infographic on # LasVegas attack & indicated the shooter , """""""" Abu Abdul Barr al - Amriki , """""""" converted 6 months ago pic.twitter.com/5JhMFbU2Se — SITE Intel Group ( @siteintelgroup ) October 5 , 2017 ",0
"On Thursday evening , Representative Scott Perry ( R - PA ) appeared on Tucker Carlson tonight and said that he has evidence that the Islamic State may be telling the truth and that they may actually have been involved in the deadly attack ",0
"Perry brought up the fact that we ca n't seem to get information in the case that the public needs to be made aware of , something that was brought up in a district courtroom earlier this week ",0
"Additionally , the family of Stephen Paddock just received his cremated remains on Thursday and his brother said that the family has yet to receive an autopsy report ",0
Why is that ? ,0
Everyone who was killed that night had autopsies and those have been released ,0
"We 're told Paddock shot himself in the head , right ? ",0
Why would the autopsy report be something that needs to be withheld from the public or his family ? ,1
""""""""" Recently I ’ve been made aware of what I believe to be credible evidence regarding potential terrorist infiltration through the southern border regarding this incident , """""""" Perry said ",1

"Yet , though they claim that Paddock was a lone gunman , they continue to withhold video of him in Mandalay Bay because they are still investigating other suspects to charge in the shooting ",0
And no one seems to know where alleged Mandalay Bay security guard Jesus Campos is either ,0
None of this is really that surprising ,0
"If you recall , we reported on Islamic terrorists settling into Mexico and crossing the border some years back and that came out as the infamous """""""" Gang of Eight """""""" were working on an immigration deal and had rejected building the 700 miles of double - tier border fencing Congress authorized just seven years ago , with a majority of the Senate saying they did n't want to delay granting illegal immigrants legal status while the fence was being built ",0
"Three years prior to that report , there was a video report that seems to have provided a bit of evidence to the claim that Islamists were crossing our southern border ",0
"And even though Islamic jihadis have been apprehended on our border in 2014 , the Homeland Security waved their hand and said , """""""" There 's no threat ",1

"In fact , DHS had denied Muslim terrorists were crossing the border , but a local investigator produced evidence to the contrary ",0
"Reports indicated that some jihadis were paying as much as $ 50,000 to get across the border ",0

It 's not surprising ,0
What is surprising is the level of secrecy surrounding the Las Vegas shooting and the containment of information more than three months after it occurred ,1
SPECIAL REPORT : Pope Francis Accused of Inaction in Notorious Sex Abuse Cases ,0
"The incident was brief : on the Thursday of the pope ’s week - long South American trip , in response to an impromptu question tossed out by a Chilean reporter , the pope responded in what one reporter described as a “ snippy tone ” : “ The day I see proof against Bishop Barros , then I will talk ",1
There is not a single piece of evidence against him ,0
It is all calumny ,0
Is that clear ? ” ,0
"This month has been quite a spectacle , even for this pontificate ; an apparently unending stream of outrages and embarrassments , with the pope and his Vatican media support jumping from one scandal to the next ",1
"But among secular reporters the sex abuse issue trumps all others and the fallout continues to blaze down on the Bergoglian pontificate in response to his amazing accusation earlier this month that victims of sexual abuse by clergy were engaging in “ calumny , ” in their accusations against a Chilean bishop , Juan de la Cruz Barros Madrid ",1
"It seems the shine is coming off the papal penny among leftist secular journalists , his natural constituency ",1
"Writing for the Boston Globe , the paper that first broke the clerical sex abuse scandals all the way back in 2001 , Kevin Cullen wrote , “ Let the record show that the promise of Pope Francis died in Santiago , Chile , on Jan. 18 , in the year of our Lord 2018 … he has revealed himself like no one else could ",0
” ,0
But it gets worse than this ,0
"When a “ leftist ” pope pressing a secularist agenda on the Church starts to lose the support of Michael Sean Winters and the National Catholic Reporter , he must know he ’s in trouble ",1
"Though he ’s “ sticking with Francis ” for now , Winters wrote , “ I wish I knew what it was about Pope Francis that makes him fail to grasp the situation with Bishop Barros , the pain caused to the victims and the damage done to the church ",0
I am gobsmacked that the pope twice declined to accept the bishop ’s resignation ,1
” ,0
"On January 23rd , an unsigned NCR editorial opined , “ Within the space of four days , Pope Francis twice slandered abuse survivors ",0
” ,0
“ These remarks are at the least shameful ,0
"At the most , they suggest that Francis now could be complicit in the cover - up ",0
"The script is all too familiar : Discredit the survivors’ testimony , support the prelate in question , and bank on public attention moving on to something else ",0
“ The insistence with which Francis defends Barros is mystifying ,1
Three separate journalists on the papal flight gave the pope opportunity to say why exactly he believed the bishop instead of the survivors accusing him ,0
The second journalist to ask Francis about Barros on the flight was a Chilean woman ,0
"As she spoke to the pope , her voice cracked with nervousness at questioning the church ’s top leader ",1
She asked : ‘ Why are not the victims’ testimonies proof for you ? ,0
"Why do you not believe them?’ The pope gave no satisfying answer , only repeating a claim of ‘ no evidence’ against the bishop ",0
” ,0
"Indeed , it was understood , as the Washington Post said , that Francis’ trip to Latin America – dogged by protests over Barros both in person at the pope ’s appearances and in the press – was in part intended as “ an apology tour ” to abuse survivors ",0
Which is why his accusation of calumny against those same victims the next day came as such a shock to observers unused to Bergoglio ’s ability to turn on a dime ,0
All was going as planned ,0
"On Wednesday , January 17 , the pope met as scheduled with selected survivors of sexual abuse by priests ",0
"He made all the right noises , talking about his “ pain and shame , ” and reportedly even crying , at what happened ",0
"“ I know the pain of these cases of child abuse and I am following how much is needed to overcome this serious and painful evil , ” he said ",1
24 hours later he was calling them liars ,0
"James Hamilton , 49 and now a doctor , was one of the Barros accusers ",0
"He told the BBC at a press conference , “ What the Pope has done today is offensive and painful , and not only against us , but against everyone seeking to end the abuses ",0
"” The lead voice of the victims in Chile , Juan Carlos Cruz , tweeting to one of Francis ’s leading apologists , Austen Ivereigh , said , “ Does he need a photo , a selfie , as proof ? ",0
"Sorry Austen , we did n’t think of it as we were being abused and Juan Barros watching ",0
” ,0
"Although the issue came to the attention of a much broader audience during the most recent papal trip , the outcry has been ongoing since his appointment to the southern Chilean diocese of Osorno in 2015 ",0
"Barros was a student protégée of the charismatic homosexual / pederast predator Fernando Karadima , and went on to be ordained in 1984 , made bishop in 1995 and appointed as bishop of the armed forces ",1
Barros claimed in court that the first he knew of Karadima ’s offenses was on a Chilean television programme in 2010 ,0
This is refuted by Karadima ’s victims – deemed credible both by the secular courts and the Vatican tribunal – who testified that he personally witnessed the abuse at Sacred Heart of Jesus church in Santiago ,0
"Last Thursday , however , was not the first time Francis , confronted unexpectedly in public over the Barros question , has responded testily and with insults ",0
"In 2015 the Italian newspaper Il Fatto Quotidiano published a video of him scolding two women who spoke with him in St. Peter ’s Piazza , asking that he reconsider the appointment , citing the “ suffering ” of the Church in Chile over the issue ",0
"The pope told the women , “ The Church has lost its freedom , letting its head fill with politicians and accusing a bishop without having any proof , after twenty years of service , so think with your head ",1
” He warned them not to allow themselves to be led by “ leftists who have set up this thing ,1
” ,0
"“ The only charge against this bishop has been discredited by the Court of Justice , so please do not lose your serenity , you suffer , but because you are foolish ... I am the first to judge and punish those accused of similar crimes , but in this case there is not even a proof ",1
” ,0
The insults were not forgotten ,0
"Among the signs held by protesters in Chile last week were those reading , “ Ni zurdos , ni tontos , ” ( Neither lefties nor stupid ) ",1
"The jab certainly was n’t lost on Francis , since the signs were being held by protesters the full length of his auto route to Santiago from the airport ",0
"One of the protesters told the BBC , “ He does n’t even know us , so how can he accuse us of being such things ? ",0
He thinks we are politically motivated even though we come from different parishes in Osorno and are doing this because we are against priests being allowed to abuse children ,0
” ,0
Apparently His Holiness was informed that the “ calumny ” comment had caused some blow - back because a couple of days later we got something touted – though somewhat skeptically – as a “ contrite ” papal apology ,1
"This also followed an astonishing public rebuke of the pope by Sean Cardinal O’Malley – a member of the C9 council of cardinals and the former head of the pope ’s sex abuse commission – who said , “ It is understandable that Pope Francis’ statements yesterday in Santiago , Chile were a source of great pain for survivors of sexual abuse by clergy or any other perpetrator ",0
” ,0
"“ Pope Francis fully recognizes the egregious failures of the Church and its clergy who abused children and the devastating impact those crimes have had on survivors and their loved ones , ” O’Malley said ",1
"Of course , Francis being Francis the apology was banked around with assertions of how right he was ",0
"“ I have to ask forgiveness because the word ‘ proof’ wounded , ” he said ",0
"“ It wounded many people who were abused … I ask them for forgiveness because I wounded them without realizing it , but it was an unintended wound ",0
"And this horrified me a lot , because I had received them ",1
” ,0
"“ And I know how much they suffer , to feel that the Pope says in their face ‘ bring me a letter , a proof.’ It ’s a slap ",0
"And I agree that my expression was not apt , because I did n’t think ",0
” ,0
"He doubled down , saying , “ I have not heard any victim of Barros ",0
"They did not come , they did not show themselves , they did not give evidence in court ",0
It ’s all in the air ,1
It is true that Barros was in Karadima ’s group of young people ,0
"But let us be clear : if you accuse someone without evidence with pertinacity , that is calumny ",0
” ,0
“ This is what I can say with sincerity ,0
Barros will remain there if I do n’t find a way to condemn him ,0
I can not condemn him if I do n’t have – I do n’t say proof – but evidence ,0
And there are many ways to get evidence ,0
Is that clear ? ” ,0
This “ contrite ” papal apology did n’t fly well even with the regular news reporters ,0
"Philip Pullela , a reporter on the plane for Reuters , described it as “ an extremely rare act of self - criticism , ” for the “ unusually contrite ” Bergoglio , and noted that , “ While the pope has vowed ‘ zero tolerance’ for sexual abuse , his efforts have sputtered ",1
” ,0
"Indeed , Francis claim that he met with and heard the “ pain ” of the victims is untrue in the specific case in hand ",0
CBS News reports that though the Osorno group had tried to obtain a meeting during the trip they were refused ,0
"Greg Burke , the pope ’s press officer , confirmed that “ no papal meetings were planned with the Osorno group , which had formally requested to meet with the pope in July but were told by Vatican organizers that his schedule was already final , some six months before the trip ",0
” ,0
Who is Barros ? ,0
Some may remember a video that made the internet rounds of an uproar in a Chilean cathedral at the installation ceremony of a bishop ,0
At the time it did n’t draw much attention from the English language press – mostly at that time distracted by the ongoing battle of the notorious Kasper Proposal and the oncoming Synods ,0
"But despite the pope ’s claim , the charges against Barros are serious and have been deemed credible by a judge ",0
"He is accused of having covered up sexual abuse , including destroying evidence , committed by Karadima in the ‘ 80s and ‘ 90s ",0
"In fact – and this point has tended to get glossed over in the press – Barros is accused by the victims of having been in the room , watching at the time , and of engaging in sexual activity with Karadima ",0
"This is not , therefore , merely a matter of a bishop or colleague discovering the abuse after the fact , but of being a voyeuristic participant ",1
"Juan Carlos Cruz , told the press in 2015 that he and another boy – both in their teens at the time – “ would lie down on the priest ’s [ Karadima ’s ] bed , one resting his head at the man ’s shoulder , another sitting near his feet ",0
"The priest would kiss the boys and grope them , he said , all while the Rev. ",0
Juan Barros watched ,0
"” Cruz , now a 51-year - old “ gay ” journalist , told The Associated Press , “ Barros was there , and he saw it all ",0
” ,0
A Vatican investigation found Karadima guilty in 2011 and sentenced him to a life of seclusion in a monastery for “ penitence and prayer ,0
"” Note that date ; 2011 was when the processes for investigating and trying priest - abusers , put in place by the former Cardinal Ratzinger , were still in effect , and while he was still sitting on the Petrine throne ",1
Things are a bit different now ,0
Neither was the complaint against Barros without the support of responsible people ,0
"The media reported that over 1,300 Catholic faithful in Osorno , including 30 priests of the diocese and 51 members of Parliament , wrote to the pope asking him to rescind the appointment – none of which received any response ",0
Fr ,0
"Peter Kleigel , a priest of Osorno , told Associated Press , “ We ’re convinced that this appointment is not correct because , following canon law , a bishop must be well - regarded ",0
We need a bishop who ’s credible ,0
” ,0
"The problem with getting the news out about Karadima , as in most of these cases , was the bishop , in this case Cardinal Francisco Javier Errázuriz of Santiago , who after the Conclave of 2013 was appointed a member of Pope Francis ’s C9 inner council ",0
"It was certainly never a secret that Errázuriz was a close , like - minded friend and collaborator of then - Cardinal Bergoglio , the kingpin of South American Catholicism ",1
"Allegations against Karadima – that went back to 1962 – had certainly been reported to Church authorities well before a Chilean news agency revealed the case in 2010 , but were ignored by Errázuriz ",0
"Even the National Catholic Reporter in 2014 pointed to the cover up and the relationship between the new pope and the accused cardinals , ",0
"“ Hamilton had applied for a marriage annulment , after telling his wife of a long psychosexual entanglement with Karadima that began when he was 17 in El Bosque ",0
"His wife confided in a priest , who told Errázuriz in 2006 ",0
"When a canon lawyer and several priests close to the cardinal suggested that Hamilton not mention Karadima , he pressed on with his request in order to force the issue of punishment for the priest while having his marriage annulled ",0
"Again , Errázuriz refused to take action against Karadima ",0
” ,0
The pope ’s claim that there is “ no evidence ” flies in the face of the ruling of the civil judge in the Karadima case – a fact that ought to be of paramount consideration under the Vatican ’s own rules for determining credibility in such cases ,0
"While Judge Jessica Gonzalez was forced to drop criminal charges because the statute of limitations had expired , she affirmed that testimony by Cruz and other victims was credible ",0
"After a full year of investigation , Gonzalez called their claims “ truthful and reliable ” ",0
"Victims said that a letter written to Church authorities complaining of Karadima ’s abuse in 1982 was intercepted and destroyed by Barros , who was serving at the time as secretary to Cardinal Francisco Fresno , Errázuriz ’s successor and collaborator ",0
"As for Barros ’s general credibility as a Catholic bishop , the witness of the victims is damning ",0
"In a letter to Bishop Ivo Scapolo , papal nuncio to Chile , that Cruz gave to the Associated Press , he said he witnessed Karadima and Barros in an intimate relationship ",0
“ I saw Karadima and Juan Barros kissing and touching each other ,0
The groping generally came from Karadima touching Barros’ genitals ” ,0
Barros has never denied having had a close friendship with Karadima ,0
"Hamilton confirmed this saying , “ I saw how Barros watched it all ",0
” ,0
And the matter did n’t end in 2010 ,0
Emails published in Chile in 2015 showed that Cardinal Errázuriz also blocked the appointment of Juan Carlos Cruz from the new child protection commission – a group plagued by such scandals and eventually ignored to death by Francis ,1
Which brings us to Francis Bergoglio ’s own record in this area ,0
"The pope claimed “ I am the first to judge and punish those accused of similar crimes , ” but this claim is not supported by the reality ",0
"Indeed , it has been pointed out that Francis has gone to considerable lengths to dismantle the efforts of his predecessor at “ safeguarding ” young people , punishing abusers and removing bishops who cover it up ",0
"In the case of Barros , the Associated Press obtained a confidential letter from Pope Francis dated 2015 that “ reveals the [ Chilean ] bishops’ concern about Francis naming a Karadima protégé , Bishop Juan Barros ",0
"” Just days before the pope ’s “ calumny ” comment , January 11 , AP reported that Francis had full knowledge of the controversy he risked in appointing Barros to Osorno ",0
“ [ H]is ambassador in Chile had tried to find a way to contain the damage well before the case made headlines ,0
” ,0
"The letter , addressed to the executive committee of the Chilean bishops’ conference , said , “ Thank you for having openly demonstrated the concern that you have about the appointment of Monsignor Juan Barros ",0
I understand what you ’re telling me and I ’m aware that the situation of the church in Chile is difficult due to the trials you ’ve had to undergo ,0
"” The letter said that in 2014 the nuncio , Archbishop Scapolo , had asked Barros to resign as bishop of the armed forces and had “ encouraged him to take a sabbatical year before assuming any other pastoral responsibility as a bishop ",0
” ,0
There can also be little doubt the new pope was fully aware of the record of his close friend Cardinal Errázuriz in ignoring complaints of Karadima ’s victims when he appointed him to the C9 council ,0
"And even if he did n’t then , he certainly knows now , and yet Errazuriz continues in that advisory role ",0
"Francis further appointed Cardinal Errázuriz to serve as his Special Envoy to World Apostolic Congress Of Mercy III meeting in Bogotá , Colombia in June 2014 ",0
"Since 2001 , Cardinal Ratzinger and later as Pope Benedict installed effective procedural reforms on clerical sexual abuse ; Francis in his short five years has all but completely dismantled or reversed those changes ",0
"Among the earliest indications Catholics had that the new pope had no intention of getting to the bottom of the priest - abuser problem was his appointment of the notorious homosexual , Monsignor Battista Ricca , as head of the Vatican Bank and the man in charge of his own residence , the Casa Santa Martha ",1
"It is often forgotten that Bergoglio ’s notorious comment “ who am I to judge ” was in response to a question on a plane - presser about Ricca , and was followed with a similar claim from Francis about there having been no proof of his misbehaviour ",1
"As the pseudonymous Marcantonio Colonna wrote in the book , “ The Dictator Pope , ” “ In fact his patronage of Monsignor Ricca fits the pattern which was well established when he was Archbishop of Buenos Aires , whereby he surrounds himself with morally weak people so as to have them under his thumb ",1
” ,0
But even before this was the sinister appearance of Godfried Cardinal Danneels on the loggia on the night of Francis ’s election to the papacy ,1
Danneels ’s prominence in the Bergoglian pontificate continues to be the most prominent indicator of the pope ’s deprioritising of clerical sexual abuse ,0
"The former head of the Brussels archdiocese was a leading figure in the so - called St. Gallen Group , which he himself described as a “ mafia , ” who had worked against the election of Joseph Ratzinger in 2005 and to elect Bergoglio in 2013 ",1
"At the end of a long career as Europe ’s leading “ liberal ” Catholic prelate , Danneels came under a cloud of scandal when he was accused of having covered for a protégé bishop who admitted to having sexually abused his own minor nephew ",0
In 2010 the publication of an audio recording determined undeniably that Danneels had told the victim to keep quiet and not cause trouble for the soon - to - retire Bishop Roger Vangheluwe of Bruges ,0
The cardinal even went so far as to suggest that the victim should “ ask forgiveness ” for his own role in the scandal ,0
"Before the recordings were released , Danneels had also denied all knowledge of sexual abuse by clergy or cover - ups ",0
"In the book , Colonna asks the question , “ What happened to ‘ Zero Tolerance’ for clerical sexual offenders ? ” He wrote that data presented by the Vatican the UN Human Rights Commission in January 2014 showed that Benedict XVI “ had defrocked or suspended more than 800 priests for past sexual abuse between 2009 and 2012 , ” including the notorious Fr ",1
"Maciel Degollado , founder of the Legionaries of Christ ",0
"Crucially , it was Ratzinger who moved the competence for sex abuse cases from the Congregation for Bishops to Doctrine of the Faith , with powers to suspend and punish offenders ",0
His reforms specifically included bishops who had refused to act against priest - abusers ,0
"A senior member of the Vatican ’s diplomatic corps , Archbishop Miguel Maury Buendia , confirmed this , saying , “ This Pope has removed two or three bishops per month throughout the world ... ",0
"There have been two or three instances in which they said no , and so the Pope simply removed them ",0
” ,0
These reforms – and removals – have ceased entirely under Francis ,0
"Despite his claims that he punishes the guilty , it was in fact Francis who reversed the previous , Benedict - era sentence against the notorious Italian priest - pederast Mario Inzoli at the request of the now - equally notorious Cardinal Coccopalmerio ",1
Inzoli was found guilty in 2012 by an ecclesiastical court of abusing boys as young as twelve and suspended ,0
"Inzoli had even abused boys in the confessional , convincing them that the abuse was approved by God ",1
"Following an appeal by Coccopalmerio , Francis reduced the priest ’s penalty to a “ lifetime of prayer , ” with permission to say Mass privately , and a promise to stay away from children ",0
"The uproar over this caused the Italian prosecutors to reopen the case against the priest , and eventually Inzoli went to prison and was laicized ",0
"As for Ratzinger / Benedict ’s procedural reforms , rumours continue to circulate that the pope intends to reverse them as well , placing competence back into the hands of the same dicastery that held it when the scandals broke in 2001 ",0
"This has been denied by Greg Burke , but given Francis ’s usual methods , it ’s anyone ’s guess who in reality is actually dealing with these cases , if anyone ",1
"A tribunal of bishops , requested by his own sex abuse commission , was ignored and then Francis summarily removed two of the CDF staffers in charge of handling such cases , famously refusing to give any reasons to CDF prefect Cardinal Müller who was soon to be dismissed ",0
"In fact , the chaos and lack of commitment on the issue has come under harsh criticism from at least one member of the pope ’s now - defunct sex abuse commission , a loudly trumpeted part of Bergoglio ’s early scheme of reform ",1
"Marie Collins , an Irish abuse survivor , was appointed in 2014 to the new Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors ",0
"She resigned in 2017 , citing “ Vatican officials’ reluctance to cooperate with its work to protect children ",0
"” Collins released a damning statement , indicating that the commission had never seriously intended to change or reform anything ",0
She said none of the commission ’s recommendations had been implemented ,0
"“ The reluctance of some in the Vatican Curia to implement recommendations or cooperate with the work of a commission when the purpose is to improve the safety of children and vulnerable adults around the world is unacceptable , ” Collins wrote ",1
"As of December last year , the commission has been allowed to lapse , and no longer functions , though it has not been definitively dissolved ",0
The terms of office of its members expired December 17th ,0
This week Collins tweeted her question for Pope Francis on the Chilean situation : “ Why does the Pope not believe these three men ? ,0
They have been consistent over years in what they say ,0
When asked why he believes his fellow cleric and not the survivors he can give no good reason ,0

"BELLEVUE , WA – The Department of Justice and Second Amendment Foundation have reached a settlement in SAF ’s lawsuit on behalf of Cody Wilson and Defense Distributed over free speech issues related to 3-D files and other information that may be used to manufacture lawful firearms ",0
"SAF and Defense Distributed had filed suit against the State Department under the Obama administration , challenging a May 2013 attempt to control public speech as an export under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations ( ITAR ) , a Cold War - era law intended to control exports of military articles ",1
"Under terms of the settlement , the government has agreed to waive its prior restraint against the plaintiffs , allowing them to freely publish the 3-D files and other information at issue ",0
"The government has also agreed to pay a significant portion of the plaintiffs’ attorney ’s fees , and to return $ 10,000 in State Department registration dues paid by Defense Distributed as a result of the prior restraint ",0
"Significantly , the government expressly acknowledges that non - automatic firearms up to .50-caliber – including modern semi - auto sporting rifles such as the popular AR-15 and similar firearms – are not inherently military ",0
"“ Not only is this a First Amendment victory for free speech , it also is a devastating blow to the gun prohibition lobby , ” noted SAF founder and Executive Vice President Alan M. Gottlieb ",1

"“ Under this settlement , ” he continued , “ the government will draft and pursue regulatory amendments that eliminate ITAR control over the technical information at the center of this case ",0

"Today , President Donald J. Trump signed Executive Grants of Clemency ( Full Pardons ) for Dwight Lincoln Hammond , Jr. , and his son , Steven Hammond ",0
The Hammonds are multi - generation cattle ranchers in Oregon imprisoned in connection with a fire that leaked onto a small portion of neighboring public grazing land ,1
"The evidence at trial regarding the Hammonds’ responsibility for the fire was conflicting , and the jury acquitted them on most of the charges ",0
"At the Hammonds’ original sentencing , the judge noted that they are respected in the community and that imposing the mandatory minimum , 5-year prison sentence would “ shock the conscience ” and be “ grossly disproportionate to the severity ” of their conduct ",1
"As a result , the judge imposed significantly lesser sentences ",0
"The previous administration , however , filed an overzealous appeal that resulted in the Hammonds being sentenced to five years in prison ",1
This was unjust ,1
Dwight Hammond is now 76 years old and has served approximately three years in prison ,0
The same administration that was against mandatory minimums for its drug dealers and gang members went to court to defend mandatory minimums under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act ,0
"While Obama pardoned drug dealers and locked up ranchers , Trump pardons ranchers and locks up drug dealers ",0
"Both men are currently in prison on five - year sentences , thanks in part to a 1996 antiterrorism law that imposed a mandatory minimum sentence on certain crimes on federal land ",0
"The length of their prison terms , in part , fueled outrage at their convictions ",1
"Federal Judge Michael Robert Hogan originally gave the Hammonds reduced sentences in 2012 , arguing that the mandatory minimums were unjust ",1
"But the Obama administration appealed , and federal Judge Ann Aiken in 2015 imposed the full five - year sentences ",0
Hogan was a Bush appointee who respected the law ,0
"Aiken was a Dem fundraiser , her husband was the chair of the Oregon Dem party , appointed by Bill Clinton ",1
"Aiken was unqualified for her role , except in the ways that mattered to the Clintons and their Dem allies ",1
These pardons cleanse another stain from our nation 's history in the dark years of Obama ,1
"Et Tu , Benedict ? ",0
( Some Final Thoughts on Joseph Ratzinger ) ,0
"Recently an editor of a “ conservative ” Catholic magazine asked me if I would be interested in contributing a piece about the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI , five years on ",0
"I declined , telling him that I was morally certain that anything I had to say about it would not be in keeping with his editorial policies ",0
"It ’s been five years , and I ’ve noticed that there are a lot fewer people talking about what a “ courageous ” act it was to give up the pontificate ",0
The consequences of that act have been so outlandish – even for people who are mostly OK with Francis – that very few people are still willing to make polite noises about it ,1
Editor 's Note : In a March 11th letter signed by Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI and addressed to Msgr ,0
"Dario Vigano , prefect of the Secretariat for Communications , the former pope reportedly offers an impassioned defense of Pope Francis against the claim that he lacks theological and philosophical formation ",1
"In no uncertain terms , this letter , bearing Benedict 's signature , affirms that “ there is an internal continuity between the two pontificates ",0
"” Whether Benedict actually wrote this letter or not , it gives rise to a number of grave questions that need to be answered rather urgently before history closes the book on this commedia diabolica ",1
"Our thanks to Remnant columnist , Hilary White , for addressing the most pertinent of these here below ",0
MJM ,0
"In fact , five years after the resignation of Pope Benedict the Catholic faithful mostly want to know why ; why would a pope – a man with decades of up - close - and - personal experience of the “ filth ” in the Curia and throughout the church – suddenly just decide to quit ? ",1
Why would he choose to walk away knowing that his task was not completed ? ,0
"At the time and since then , particularly in light of what has been happening , it seems one of the most bizarre aspects of this whole bizarre situation that the reasons offered have been so trivial , so inappropriately , so disproportionately petty ",1
These absurd responses to serious questions of grave import have raised the inescapable suspicion that Benedict simply did not take the papacy as seriously as the rest of us did ,1
We can not help but wonder if these trivialised responses reveal some deep flaw that we had never suspected before ,0
Could we have been wrong about him ? ,1
"And if so , could we have been this wrong ? ",1
"For reasons , all we heard at the time was , essentially , “ I ’m tired ",1
"” There was some implication that he did n’t feel up to international travel anymore , so could n’t make it to World Youth Day and similar events ",1
"The trivialising of the resignation seemed to go hand in hand with the modern concept of the pope - as - pop - star , something we had thought Benedict was too serious a man , too serious a Catholic , to believe himself ",1
"Of all people , we had assumed that Benedict XVI took the papacy seriously ",0
"And since then , as all the poisons that had been lurking for fifty years in the NewChurch mud are busily hatching out , many Catholics want to know why we hear nothing from him ? ",1
"This man whom we had believed a “ champion of orthodoxy , ” whom we thought we knew ",1
"Error , even heresy and blasphemy are pouring daily out of the mouth of his successor , who has , literally , turned the Vatican into a den of thieves , and we hear nothing but the occasional , carefully worded statement on how fine everything is ",1
How content he is with his decision and how happy with his current life ,0
"After three years of systematic dismantling of everything he had attempted to do in his pontificate , we got this from an apparently utterly insouciant Ratzinger , addressed to Francis : “ Your goodness is my home and the place where I feel safe ",1
"” Everyone who had ever read anything he had written were amazed he was capable of producing such maudlin drivel , but the video does n’t lie : ",0
"So strange was this new tone that speculation started circulating that he was under some kind of external compulsion , not free to speak his mind ",0
But this is not what we see ,0
"There he is , manifestly happy and reading it out loud ",0
“ Perhaps it was written for him ,0
"” Well , why repeat it then ? ",0
"Why , if he has any qualms , allow himself to be trotted out on such occasions , to read this blatant propaganda ? ",0
"If it is a deception , why participate in it ? ",0
"In fact , all the hopeful commenters on blogs and other social media who keep telling me how much they “ miss ” him have failed to respect him in one way ; they wo n’t take him at his word ",0
Some insist that his resignation was under some sort of coercion and so is n’t valid ,0
"But we have repeatedly heard from him that he was under no constraint , that he had resigned freely ",0
"And indeed , far from being an isolated “ prisoner of the Vatican , ” Benedict has received many guests all of whom report that , though frail , he appears content and never utters a word of criticism ",1
We have yet to hear any report of any notes begging for rescue hidden under a lunch table placemat ,0
"There ’s no doubt that this is an extremely strange and frankly fishy situation ; something does n’t add up , it ’s true ",0
"All the questions have gone ignored , or have received frivolous , jokey responses : ",1
Why did you resign ? ,0
Ratzinger : “ I was a bit tired and did n’t feel up to partying with the kids at World Youth Day ,0
” ,0
"If you ’re not pope , why do you still wear the white ? ",0
"Ratzinger : “ Oh , there was n’t a black cassock that fit me ",0
” ,0
Why do you continue to call yourself Benedict XVI if you are no longer pope ? ,0
"Ratzinger : “ Well , I ’m an ‘ emeritus,’ you see … ” ",0
And where did this “ emeritus ” business come from ? ,0
Does it have any precedent in Catholic history ? ,0
What does it mean canonically and doctrinally ? ,0
Ratzinger : “ … ” ,0
What was all that rubbish from Ganswein about there being a divided “ munus ” – with an active member and a “ contemplative member ” ? ,1
Does n’t that just mean there are two popes now ? ,0
Ratzinger : “ … ” ,0
"And perhaps most agonising of all : “ How can you just sit there smiling , issuing bland platitudinous nonsense , while this lunatic drives the sheep off a cliff ? ” ",1
"A few days ago , my friend Steve Skojec , of the traditionalist / restorationist website One Peter Five , summed up the consternation of those of us who still feel a lingering affection for ( the man we used to call ) Pope Benedict ",0
Steve summons up in this brief post all the anger and all the crushing disappointment most of us probably still feel reluctant to express out loud : ,1
"Five years ago today , Pope Benedict XVI abdicated the papacy ",0
"And through the abandonment of his duty to shepherd the Church , he made way for the worst papacy of all time – one he steadfastly refuses to oppose in word , deed , or even the subtlest gesture ",0
"You may love him for various reasons , you may miss him by contrast , but you may not excuse the responsibility he has ",0
"He walked away from his family , leaving the door open to an abusive stepfather , and he watches his children beaten and led astray not just in silence , but in apparent contentment ",1
"And still , he was the best of the post - conciliar popes , which is why he ’s the only one who wo n’t be canonized ",0
Who is the real Joseph Ratzinger ? ,0
"I have had long - time Vatican watchers say to me , more than once , “ Maybe it ’s really just that he was n’t who we thought he was ",0
” I suspect there is a lot more to this than most people might imagine ,0
I think we made the mistake of believing the press ,0
We were delighted that the bitterly anti - Catholic media hated and feared him ,1
We failed to recall that they know nothing at all about Catholicism ,0
"What the papers never told us was that as a young priest and theologian Joseph Ratzinger was known as a “ progressive , ” as the term was understood in 1962 ",1
"This reputation was cemented during his work as the peritus , the theological advisor , of one of the Council ’s most influential of the bishops of the progressive camp , Cardinal Josef Frings of Cologne ",0
"Frings’ claim to fame in that great drama was a speech criticising the CDF – and its prefect Cardinal Alfredo Ottaviani – for the “ conservatism ” in the “ schema , ” the documents prepared by the CDF for guiding the bishops’ discussions ",0
"After this speech , there was an uprising among the bishops of the preparatory committee who demanded that the schema – that had taken years to develop – be abandoned ",0
"This was done , over Ottaviani ’s futile objections , and new documents were rapidly cobbled together by a coalition of German and French “ progressives ” who rejoiced that they had , in effect , seized control of the Council from that moment , before it had even started ",1
It has since been revealed that it was Joseph Ratzinger – the maverick “ progressive ” academic theologian Frings had brought to Rome as his secretary – who wrote that speech ,1
"Cardinal Henri de Lubac , writing in 1985 , recalling that drama , said : ",0
"“ Joseph Ratzinger , an expert at the Council , was also the private secretary of Card ",0
"Frings , Archbishop of Cologne ",0
"Blind , the old Cardinal largely utilized his secretary to write his interventions ",0
"Now then , one of these interventions became memorable : it was a radical criticism of the methods of the Holy Office ",0
Despite a reply by Card ,0
"Ottaviani , Frings sustained his critique ",0
"“ It is not an exaggeration to say that on that day the old Holy Office , as it presented itself then , was destroyed by Ratzinger in union with his Archbishop ",0
“ Card ,0
"Seper , a man full of goodness , intiated the renovation ",1
"Ratzinger , who did not change , continues it ",0
” ,0
"Ratzinger ’s reputation as a “ progressive ” is not based on one incident , nor was it restricted to his early work ",1
"It went unnoticed in the shouting over his running of CDF , that he had written in 1982 , a call for the Church “ never to return ” to the Syllabus of Errors of Pius IX ",0
"In his book Principles of Catholic Theology , Ratzinger proposed the question , “ Should the Council be revoked ? ” and in response recommended the “ razing of the bastions ” of the Catholic Church in relation to the modern world : ",0
"The duty is , therefore , not to suppress the Council , but to discover the real Council and delve deep into what it truly wants with regard to what has happened since then ",0
"This implies that there is no possible return to the Syllabus , which could well have been a first step in the combat against Liberalism and the nascent Marxism , but which can not be the last word ",0
Neither embraces nor the ghetto can resolve the problem of [ relations with ] the modern world for the Christian ,0
"Hence , the ' razing of the bastions ' that Hans Urs von Balthasar called for already in 1952 was in effect an urgent duty ",0
"It was necessary for her [ the Church ] to raze the old bastions and confide only in the protection of the faith , the power of the word that is her unique , true , and permanent strength ",0
"But to raze the bastions can not signify that she no longer has anything to protect , or that she can live owing to different forces than those that engendered her : the water and the blood that poured from the open side of her crucified Lord ",1
"His was the thesis – a mainstay of “ conservative ” ideology – that the “ real ” Council , if only implemented properly , would be the salvation of the Church and the world , a theme he never left ",0
How ironic it must have seemed to those who remembered this history that Ratzinger would himself be given the office he had “ destroyed ” and would gain the media - generated reputation as an “ arch - conservative ” ,1
"And it starts to suggest an answer , or at least a line of inquiry , about why so little was actually accomplished in his long tenure ",0
"With the “ arch - conservative ” “ Rottweiler ” Ratzinger in CDF , why do we have the situation we have today ? ",1
What did he do to stop the explosion of neo - modernism – that burned like an unchecked wildfire throughout the Catholic world through the reign of John Paul II ? ,1
"What did “ silencing ” by Ratzinger ’s CDF do to stop Hans Kung becoming a celebrity “ priest - theologian , ” courted by the media for his loathing of Catholicism ? ",1
"Kung , who was never removed from the priesthood despite his manifest heresy ? ",0
Can we think of any other names who were corrected even to this degree ? ,0
Precious few ,0
"But we can certainly think of many , many who spent their lives and vocations blatantly denying and undermining the Catholic Faith – academic theologians , religious , priests , bishops and cardinals around the world – with never a peep of protest from Rome ",1
"Moreover , the scandalous pack of frauds we currently have in the episcopate is entirely the product of the “ arch - conservative ” John Paul II and the “ Rottweiler ” Benedict XVI pontificates ",1
"Why did we think that Ratzinger , in this crucial role of CDF prefect , was a bulwark of orthodoxy ? ",0
"Is it simply that we have moved so far away from the ancient Faith that we no longer have a realistic notion of the Faith ourselves to make a comparison , to make an objective judgement ? ",0
The “ progressive ” destroyer of Ottaviani inheriting his office and the epithet “ arch - conservative ” … ,1
"Indeed , Ratzinger himself maintained that he had never changed his theological opinions ",0
He was to say that it was his old academic colleagues like Kung and Kasper who had moved further to the ideological “ left ” after the 1960s while he stayed in place ,0
"Perhaps now , as an answer that fits our apparently contradictory puzzle pieces , we can finally accept his word on this ",0
"Perhaps the world of Catholic academic theology had become so corrupted that a man called “ progressive ” in 1963 , but whose ideas remained the same , would look like a “ champion of traditional Catholic orthodoxy ” by 2005 ",1
Is this why he resigned ? ,0
"Is it simply that his conception of the Church , of the papacy , was never what Catholics believed about it ? ",0
"Perhaps a hint at the answer comes from La Stampa in 2015 which published some of the memoirs of Silvano Fausti , SJ , who had been confessor and spiritual guide of Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini , the godfather of the “ liberal ” European Catholic Church , and alleged leader of the “ Sankt Gallen Mafia ” that Cardinal Danneels admitted conspired for years against Pope Benedict ",1
Fausti said that Benedict met with Martini at the bishops’ palace of Milan in June 2012 ,0
"Martini , Fausti said , urged Benedict to resign the papacy ",0
"Apparently at the time of his election in 2005 , Martini had said it would be his main task to reform the Curia ",0
"By 2012 , this had proved impossible ",0
Why would Benedict take advice from a man like Martini – the “ godfather ” of the “ liberal wing ” of European Catholicism ? ,1
I think the question would not even occur to a man like Ratzinger ,0
They were esteemed academic colleagues ,0
They were brothers of the episcopate ,0
They were members of the club ,0
"Any appearance of ideological division between them was , in essence , a product of the media narrative ",0
Why would n’t the pope take the advice of his most respected and senior cardinal ? ,0
Why is Walter Kasper a cardinal ? ,0
"One of the most prominent of those puzzle pieces is the apparent inability of these “ conservative ” prelates , to detect , let alone effectively oppose , these brazen enemies of the Faith within the episcopate and College of Cardinals ",1
"It beggars belief of ordinary people that , after so many years of hearing and reading them , Ratzinger would remain on such friendly terms with men like Walter Kasper and Carlo Maria Martini , the alleged brains of the Sankt Gallen Mafia ",1
"When , at his very first Angelus address in 2013 , Pope Francis told the crowd how much he loved the writing of Walter Kasper , quite a lot of us who had spent many years watching the Vatican started understanding where we were all headed with the new pope ",0
"Jorge Bergoglio might have been unknown to the larger Catholic world , but Walter Kasper was a celebrity heretic , the media - savvy frontman for the “ ultra - liberal ” “ wing ” of the post - Vatican II Church ",1
"In an article on the cardinal ’s life ’s work , Thomas Jansen , the editor - in - chief of Katholisch.de , recently noted that Walter Kasper could not possibly have done the damage he has without the direct assistance of both John Paul II and Pope Benedict ",0
The monstrous debacle of Amoris Laetitia is as much Kasper ’s work as Bergoglio ’s ,0
"This is a man who has , for 40 years , never troubled to hide his heterodox opinions and has devoted much of his life to a campaign to bring about precisely this outcome ",0
"Jansen points out that Kasper had already tried to bring out the same proposal for Communion for divorced and remarried in 1993 , together with Karl Lehmann , another “ Sankt Gallen ” member ",1
This was stopped by Ratzinger and the CDF ,0
"But that raises the next question ; if Ratzinger knew so well what kind of creature Kasper was , why was n’t the next step to pitch him out of the episcopate on his ear ? ",1
Why was he not – at the very least – given the same “ silencing ” treatment as Kung ? ,0
Kasper has recently gone to the media again to complain of being called a heretic ,0
But it ’s a simple truth : he ’s a heretic ,1
Everyone knows he ’s a heretic because we have heard him trumpeting in his blatant heresies from every rooftop he could find for decades ,1
"After openly working against the Faith , instead of being demoted , silenced , laicised and/or excommunicated , John Paul II made him a cardinal ",0
Remember that his scheme to Amoris - Latitia - ize the Church was stopped by Ratzinger ’s CDF in 1993 ,0
"But he was not demoted , reprimanded or corrected in any way ",0
Nor was he removed from places of influence ,0
Far from it ,0
In 1994 Kasper was inserted into the Vatican Curia by being named co - chair of the International Commission for Lutheran - Catholic Dialogue ,0
"In 1999 , he made another step up , being appointed secretary of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity , the “ ecumenical ” office where his manifest religious indifferentism could be given free reign ",0
"In 2001 , he was made a Cardinal - deacon with the awesome responsibility of voting in a Conclave ",1
Then Benedict allowed him to remain a cardinal ,0
"And , as if to add a finishing touch to the poisoned cake that is Ratzinger ’s involvement in the creation of the New Catholic Paradigm , Benedict is now being said to have deliberately timed his resignation in order to allow his old academic colleague to participate in the 2013 Conclave ",1
"As Jansen pointed out , and Maike Hickson quoted in a piece for One Peter Five , ",0
"Cardinal Kasper barely even made it into the last conclave , because he had just turned 80 years of age ",0
"But since the date of the death ( or abdication , as it was the case in 2013 ) of the pope is decisive , he was still able to attend and vote in that election ",0
"( As some observers noted , it was a generous gesture toward Cardinal Kasper that Pope Benedict XVI had decided to retire in due time ",0
) ,0
"Excuse me Maike , but I do n’t think this is a parenthetical issue ",0
Is it any wonder that so many Catholics have become disaffected ? ,1
"Cardinal Ratzinger , Pope “ Emeritus ” Benedict – whatever you want to call yourself – I have one question that I would really like you to answer : Why is this man still a cardinal ? ",1
Why is he still a bishop ? ,1
Why is he still allowed to call himself a “ Catholic theologian ” ? ,1
"Why did you , apparently deliberately , ensure that he was able to enter the Conclave to decide who your successor was going to be ? ",1
Does n’t anyone else want to know this ? ,0
Do n’t we all want to know why Hans Kung is still a priest ? ,0
Why was Cardinal Mahony allowed to retire in good standing ? ,0
"Why a man like Weakland , the active homosexual who paid off his ex - lover , was not excommunicated ? ",1
"What are the names we all remember , just off the top of our heads ? ",0
"My own bishop in Victoria , the occultist Remi de Roo , Seattle ’s Raymond Hunthausen , Miami ’s Favalora , Rochester ’s Matthew Clark , Derek Worlock of Liverpool … I sometimes wonder how long that list is going to be when this is all over ",0
"For fifty years Catholics have wanted to know why nothing was ever done , as these wolves in the episcopate were allowed , year after year to continue attacking the Church ",1
"Why have we so often seen these men – compromised intellectually and morally – elevated to superior rank , despite the incredible brazenness of their hatred of the Catholic Faith ? ",1
The end of “ Big Umbrella Catholicism ” ,0
The New York Times’ Ross Douthat is among those who are starting to ask these kinds of questions ,0
"Maike Hickson quotes him , writing of this bizarre situation – in which each , of the so - called “ Sankt Gallen Mafia ” prelates , including Kasper , who openly campaigned for the effective abolition of Catholic moral teaching : “ It was characteristic of the church ’s effective truce [ between conservatives and progressivists ] that John Paul II himself had given most of them their red hats , elevating them despite their disagreement with his restorationist approach ",1
” ,0
"When journalists talk about Catholicism , they often speak of a man like Kasper being – as his Wikipedia page puts it – “ one of the main figures of the liberal wing of the Catholic Church ",1
"” And this is supposed to make some kind of sense to Catholics , we ’re supposed to accept it as the reality of our times ",0
There ’s a “ liberal wing ” and a “ conservative wing ” and they ’re both Catholic ,0
"Steve Skojec told me that our willingness to go along with the whole “ emeritus pope ” charade was an error : “ I think the problem is that we all went along with their game of make believe , and we should n’t have ",1
"” In fact , I am starting to think that the willingness of most Catholics to go along with the entire charade of post - conciliar Catholicism has been a grave error ",1
"By playing along , by pretending that we could be “ conservative Catholics ” in this New Paradigm that also includes “ liberal Catholics ” we have helped them perpetrate one the most monstrous frauds in human history ",0
"Because of this schizophrenic mindset of the Church ’s leadership since 1965 , we have all come to accept the underlying premise ; that the Church is a “ big umbrella ” with plenty of room for people of all personal opinions , that such issues as liturgy are matters of personal “ taste ” … that two opposed things can both be Catholic truth ",1
"This schizophrenia is the model under which “ conservatives ” have operated all this time , and by which they have judged a man like Joseph Ratzinger to be a “ conservative champion of orthodoxy ",1
” And what has this achieved ? ,1
It created cover for the men of Kasper ’s clique to maneuver their man on the throne of Peter five years ago ,0
"And just like that , the jargon of “ tolerance ” and the “ big umbrella ” is over and the purge of faithful , believing Catholic religious , seminarians , priests , and academics has begun ",0
As it had to ,0
"They , at least , do not harbour this insane contradiction , and understand – and frequently say out loud – that the New Paradigm and the Catholic Church are not the same ",0
And their New Church is the only one left ,0
"For five decades we played the Anglican game ; as long as we do n’t talk about it , there is n’t a problem ",1
"Ottaviani ’s Holy Office and schema were the last gasp of the old Church – and as de Lubac said above , it was killed by Joseph Ratzinger ",1
"We had a long hiatus in which the popes pretended nothing essential had changed , while the institution around them fell to the New Paradigm , until the papacy was the only thing left ",0
"One of the things I ’ve been saying is a blessing in disguise , and an enormous relief , about the Bergoglian era is that we can finally leave behind us the absurd situation of the Wojtyla / Ratzinger era ",0
"We were expected for all those years to pretend we were in the “ New Springtime of Vatican II , ” while we watched these wolves in shepherds’ clothing eating the sheep ",1
"Now we can , at least , finally stop pretending that everything is just dandy under the New Paradigm of Merciful Conciliar Wonderfulness ",1
"For those still wondering , Bergoglio is n’t a shock , he is n’t even a surprise ; he ’s just the logical end result ",0
"This pontificate is n’t an anomaly ; it was the only possible outcome , and it was as much the work of Joseph Ratzinger as Walter Kasper ",0
Rep. Danny Davis was For / Against / For / Against Farrakhan ,0
Rep. Danny Davis helped get the ball rolling by praising Farrakhan ,0
Democratic Illinois Rep. Danny Davis defended Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan as an “ outstanding human being ” on Monday ,1
"Farrakhan ’s history of racially extreme comments includes blaming Jews for the September 11 attacks , saying white people “ deserve to die ” and praising Adolf Hitler as a “ very great man ",1
"” “ I personally know [ Farrakhan ] , I ’ve been to his home , done meetings , participated in events with him , ” Davis told TheDC ",1
"“ I do n’t regard Louis Farrakhan as an aberration or anything , I regard him as an outstanding human being who commands a following of individuals who are learned and articulate and he plays a big role in the lives of thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of people , ” he emphasized later ",1
Then Rep. Davis ' office issued a statement disavowing Farrakhan ,0
And then Davis got right back to talking to the Daily Caller and disavowed the disavowal ,0
"“ The congressman was insistent that The Daily Caller misquoted him during the interview and that he did n’t subscribe to Farrakhan ’s anti - Semitic statements and actions in the past , ” the ADL official told JTA in a statement ",0
"“ He expressed an interest in seeing some of the latest statements made by Farrakhan vis - a - vis Jews , which we promptly shared with him ",0
"” The congressman was n’t sure why the ADL wrote that he had been misquoted in his praise for the anti - Semite , and said he was n’t sure if someone from his office had told the ADL he was misquoted , he told The Daily Caller News Foundation on Sunday ",0
“ I think that was what they wanted to write ,0
"Nah , I do n’t have no problems with Farrakhan , I do n’t spend a whole lot of my time dealing with those kind of things , ” Davis said ",0
“ That ’s just one segment of what goes on in our world ,0
The world is so much bigger than Farrakhan and the Jewish question and his position on that and so forth ,1
"For those heavy into it , that ’s their thing , but it ai n’t my thing , ” he said ",0
"The term """""""" Jewish Question """""""" is largely used by anti - Semites ",0
So Davis then sorta disavowed his own statements ,0
J Street endorsed him ,0
And then he talked to the Daily Caller again ,0
"Democratic Illinois Rep. Danny Davis thinks Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan , a notorious racist and anti - Semite , does “ outstanding work ” but does n’t agree with Farrakhan ’s positions that white people are “ devils ” and Jewish people are satanic ",1

He likes a racist hate group ,0

Trump Slams “ Disgraceful Verdict ” After San Francisco Jury Acquits “ Kate ’s Law”-Victim ’s Killer ,1
This article was originally published by Tyler Durden at Zero Hedge ,0
"Update 2 : Just as we suspected , President Trump has tweeted his opinion on this decision … ",0
A disgraceful verdict in the Kate Steinle case ! ,1
No wonder the people of our Country are so angry with Illegal Immigration ,0
"— Donald J. Trump ( @realDonaldTrump ) December 1 , 2017 ",0
Update 1 : AP reports that U.S. immigration officials say they will deport the Mexican man found not guilty of murder in San Francisco pier shooting ,0
"As we detailed earlier , in a verdict that has shocked many in the Bay Area ( and across America ) , a jury of six men and six women in sanctuary city San Francisco found illegal immigrant ( and five - time deportee ) Jose Ines Garcia Zarate not guilty in the death of Kate Steinle ",0
Mr. Garcia Zarate had been homeless at the time of the shooting and had multiple felony convictions and five prior deportations to Mexico ,0
"He had been set free from jail only months before the shooting , in defiance of requests by federal immigration authorities , who had asked that he be held longer so he could be deported again ",0
The backlash to his release into the community crescendoed when Donald Trump invoked Ms. Steinle ’s killing as he campaigned for president ,1
"As The New York Times reports , Ms. Steinle ’s death in July 2015 fed into a fierce debate over whether immigrants without legal status should be deported more aggressively , and over the role local law enforcement should play ",1
"Ms. Steinle , known as Kate , a 32-year - old medical equipment saleswoman , was walking along Pier 14 in San Francisco when she was struck by a bullet and collapsed into her father ’s arms ",0
"Mr. Garcia Zarate acknowledged firing the weapon , but said it was an accident ",0
Zarate and his defense team maintained the argument that the suspect found the stolen weapon on the pier that day and it “ just fired ,1
” The gun belonged to a federal Bureau of Land Management ranger and was stolen from his parked car a week earlier ,0
"The bullet ricocheted on the pier ’s concrete walkway before it struck Steinle , killing her ",0
"Zarate has admitted to shooting Steinle , but says it was an accident ",0
Defense attorney Matt Gonzalez said Garcia Zarate found the gun at the pier … but the stories of what happened copntradicted one another … ,0
"He said it was wrapped in cloth , and when Garcia Zarate unwrapped it , the gun accidentally discharged ",0
"But in a police interrogation , Garcia Zarate admitted to firing the gun , saying he was aiming at a seal ",0
"He also told police that he stepped on the gun , causing it to fire ",0
"But still , after six days of deliberation , the illegal Mexcian immigrant was acquitted of murder and manslaughter charges and also found not guilty of assault with a firearm ",0
"Garcia Zarate was found guilty of illegal firearms possession , which carries a sentence of 16 months to three years ",0
"The public defender wasted no time in focusing his thoughts on President Trump and his administration … saying Zarate was “ extremely relieved ” by the outcome and that while Steinle ’s death “ was a horrible tragedy , ” it was used as “ political fodder for then candidate Donald Trump ’s anti - immigration agenda ",1
” ,0
"Adachi added , “ Despite the unfairly politicized atmosphere surrounding this case , jurors focused on the evidence , which was clear and convincing , and rendered a just verdict ",1
” ,0
"In a response to the verdict , Attorney General Jeff Sessions released a statement saying that despite California ’s attempt at a murder conviction , Zarate was able to walk away with only a firearm possession conviction because he was not turned over by San Francisco to ICE ",0
"“ When jurisdictions choose to return criminal aliens to the streets rather than turning them over to federal immigration authorities , they put the public ’s safety at risk , ” the statement said ",1
“ San Francisco ’s decision to protect criminal aliens led to the preventable and heartbreaking death of Kate Steinle ,1
"” Sessions continued , “ I urge the leaders of the nation ’s communities to reflect on the outcome of this case and consider carefully the harm they are doing to their citizens by refusing to cooperate with federal law enforcement officers ",0

Google Was ‘ Working To Get Hillary Clinton Elected’ ,0
"Tucker Carlson just blew the cover off the 2016 election influence charade , after he read an internal email on Monday night ’s show from a senior Google employee who admitted to using company resources to make a “ silent donation ” to a liberal group that was creating ads and donating funds to bus Latinos to voting stations during the 2016 election in key swing states , in an effort to help Hillary Clinton win ",1
"The email was sent by the former head of Google ’s multicultural marketing department , Eliana Mario , on November 9 , 2016 ",0
"“ That email was subsequently forwarded by two Google VP ’s to more staff members throughout the company , ” says Carlson , adding “ In her email , Mario touts Google ’s multi - faceted efforts to boost Hispanic turnout in the election ",1
"She noticed that Latino voters did record - breaking numbers , especially in states like Florida , Nevada and Arizona – the last of which she describes as “ a key state for us ",1
"” She brags that the company used its power to ensure that millions of people saw certain hashtags and social media impressions , with the goal of influencing their behavior during the election ",1

Homeschooling Expands As Parents Seethe Over Liberal Social Engineering And Violence ,1
Homeschooling rates are skyrocketing as parents are continually getting more and more upset at the leftist social engineering taking place in public schools ,1
"The indoctrination is getting so bad , that some parents are even concerned about liberal violence against those who reject the brainwashing ",1
"According to The Washington Times , the recent school shooting at Parkland , Florida , was the last straw for scores of parents ",0
"The paper noted that “ the phones started ringing at the Texas Home School Coalition , and they have n’t stopped yet ",0
” ,0
"“ When the Parkland shooting happened , our phone calls and emails exploded , ” said coalition president Tim Lambert ",1
"“ In the last couple of months , our numbers have doubled ",0
"We ’re dealing with probably between 1,200 and 1,400 calls and emails per month , and prior to that it was 600 to 700 ",0
"” But according to Natural News , it is n’t just the rampant violence worrying some parents ",1
That ’s just the tip of the collectivist agenda iceberg ,0
"Christopher Chin , head of Homeschool Louisiana , told The Times that parents are fed up with “ the violence , the bullying , the unsafe environments ",1
"” Many parents are also disturbed by the social engineering , which amounts to brainwashing and indoctrination that goes on in a public school ",1
"For example , a Minnesota public school is forcing Kindergarten students to study ‘ white privilege’ ",1
The left - wing curriculum and common core are also driving parents to remove their children from public schools ,0
"Brian D. Ray , who heads up the National Home Education Research Institute , in Salem , Oregon , who ’s conducted homeschooling research for 33 years , told The Times that concern over school curriculum has reached the top of the charts for most parents ",1
"Ray said the top three reasons that parents choose homeschooling are a desire to provide religious instruction or different values than those offered in public schools ; dissatisfaction with the academic curriculum , and worries about the school environment ",0
"Since teachers are not allowed to arm themselves to defend their students against the violence often perpetrated at schools simply because they are gun free zones , homeschooling takes care of that problem ",1
"“ Most parents homeschool for more than one reason , ” Ray told the paper ",0
"“ But when we ask families why do they homeschool , near the top nowadays is concern about the environment of schools , and that includes safety , pressure to get into drugs , pressure to get into sexual activity ",1
It includes all of that ,0

Swiss bishop signs statement calling Pope ’s reading of Amoris Laetitia “ alien ” to the Catholic Faith ,0

"ROME , February 2 , 2018 ( LifeSiteNews ) —His Excellency Marian Eleganti , auxiliary bishop of Chur in Switzerland , today added his name to the “ Profession of Immutable Truths about Sacramental Marriage , ” bringing the total number of signatories to eight bishops and one cardinal , LifeSite has confirmed ",0
"Bishop Eleganti ’s support of the profession comes just three days after Bishop Athanasius Schneider , auxiliary of Astana , Kazakstan , invited the world ’s bishops to sign the document and join in raising a common voice in defense of the sanctity and the indissolubility of marriage ",0
"“ God decides the time , and the time will come when the Pope and the episcopacy again will proclaim , with all clarity , unambiguity and beauty , the sanctity of marriage , and of the family , and of the Eucharist , ” Schneider told LifesiteNews in an exclusive Jan. 15 interview ",1
Raising a Common Voice ,0
"In conversation with LifeSiteNews , Schneider said greater public support of the document from the world ’s 5,000 bishops would be “ a stronger voice for professing the constant truths of the Church , and it would be a beautiful common voice defending the sanctity and the indissolubility of marriage in the midst of a real neo - pagan society where divorce has become a plague and where sexual depravity is increasingly spreading ",1
” ,1
"The Profession of Immutable Truths about Sacramental Marriage was issued by three Kazakh Ordinaries , including Bishop Schneider , in early January ",0
"In the document , the three bishops solemnly professed the Church ’s received teaching and discipline regarding sacramental marriage and the limited conditions ( see Familiaris Consortio , n. 84 ) under which Catholics who are divorced and “ remarried ” may receive sacramental absolution and Holy Communion ",0
"They presented their profession “ before God who will judge us , ” in response to certain pastoral norms issued by several bishops’ conferences aimed at implementing chapter 8 of Pope Francis’ apostolic exhortation on the family , Amoris Laetitia ",0
"Some of these norms , Schneider told LifeSiteNews , give “ implicit approval ” of divorce and of sexual activity outside a valid marriage ",1
"Such a reading is causing “ rampant confusion , ” will spread “ a plague of divorce ” in the Church , and is “ alien ” to the Church ’s entire faith and Tradition , the three bishops said in the profession ",1
"“ This is contrary to Divine Revelation , ” Schneider further told LifeSite , adding that the “ beautiful explanations ” that are being presented to clergy and faithful as “ discernment ” and “ pastoral accompaniment , ” or a “ change of paradigm ” and “ discovery of the subjective part of the truth , ” when translated into “ common sense language , ” are tantamount to an allowance to sin ",1

The Hammond Pardons Bring Justice to Obama 's Victims ,1

"Today , President Donald J. Trump signed Executive Grants of Clemency ( Full Pardons ) for Dwight Lincoln Hammond , Jr. , and his son , Steven Hammond ",0
The Hammonds are multi - generation cattle ranchers in Oregon imprisoned in connection with a fire that leaked onto a small portion of neighboring public grazing land ,0
"The evidence at trial regarding the Hammonds’ responsibility for the fire was conflicting , and the jury acquitted them on most of the charges ",0
"At the Hammonds’ original sentencing , the judge noted that they are respected in the community and that imposing the mandatory minimum , 5-year prison sentence would “ shock the conscience ” and be “ grossly disproportionate to the severity ” of their conduct ",1
"As a result , the judge imposed significantly lesser sentences ",0
"The previous administration , however , filed an overzealous appeal that resulted in the Hammonds being sentenced to five years in prison ",1
This was unjust ,0
Dwight Hammond is now 76 years old and has served approximately three years in prison ,0
The same administration that was against mandatory minimums for its drug dealers and gang members went to court to defend mandatory minimums under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act ,0
"While Obama pardoned drug dealers and locked up ranchers , Trump pardons ranchers and locks up drug dealers ",1
"Both men are currently in prison on five - year sentences , thanks in part to a 1996 antiterrorism law that imposed a mandatory minimum sentence on certain crimes on federal land ",0
"The length of their prison terms , in part , fueled outrage at their convictions ",0
"Federal Judge Michael Robert Hogan originally gave the Hammonds reduced sentences in 2012 , arguing that the mandatory minimums were unjust ",0
"But the Obama administration appealed , and federal Judge Ann Aiken in 2015 imposed the full five - year sentences ",0
Hogan was a Bush appointee who respected the law ,0

SO MUCH FOR MERCY & DIALOGUE : Member of Vatican International Theological Commission Sacked for Questioning Pope of Mercy & Dialogue ,0
The Catholic Twitterverse is alive today with criticism of the USCCB ’s decision to sack Fr ,0
"Thomas Weinandy , the former head of their doctrinal office ",0
It took a matter of hours for the brave defenders of the status quo to leap into action against the mild Franciscan friar ’s polite plea to Pope Francis to defend the Catholic Faith and faithful ,1
Or at least to stop attacking them ,0
"In a letter made public November 1st , Fr ",0
"Weinandy , a former chief of staff for the U.S. Bishops’ Committee on Doctrine and a member of the Vatican ’s International Theological Commission , warned Pope Francis that he has caused “ chronic confusion ” among the faithful and bishops ",0
"He wrote to the pope , “ To teach with such an intentional lack of clarity inevitably risks sinning against the Holy Spirit , the Spirit of truth ",1
"” He added that Catholics are “ disconcerted ” by the appointment of bishops “ who seem not merely open to those who hold views counter to Christian belief , but who support and even defend them ",0
” ,0
"In an interview yesterday with John Allen ’s Crux , he added , more prophetically than he had perhaps intended , “ I do n’t think anyone can , or should , associate my letter with the USCCB or the American bishops ",0
"Neither was involved in my writing the letter , and its publication will be news to them ",0
” ,0
"“ Bishops are quick learners , ” he wrote in his letter , “ and what many have learned from your pontificate is not that you are open to criticism , but that you resent it , ” claiming that many bishops do n’t speak out publicly for fear they will be “ marginalized or worse ",1
” ,0
"And sure enough , within hours of making his letter public , we learned that Fr ",0
Weinandy had been given the boot ,1
"Of course , the Twitterverse is busy commenting on the irony : how a man expressing grave concerns that there is an atmosphere of fear of being punished for expressing grave concerns , was immediately fired ",0
Perhaps the most astonishing aspect of this little incident is just how completely blind the US bishops – as with nearly all the episcopate – are to what political analysts call the “ optics ” ,1
Political consultants often ask : how does it look ? ,0
And it looks extremely bad ,1
"As though the fog of irony were n’t thick enough , in response to the outrage from Catholics , the USCCB has done what all the other members of Pope Francis’ cabal have done and started blocking critics from its Twitter account ",0
"Which , it must be said , only proves Fr ",0
Weinandy ’s point once again ,0
Some of the criticism has been unusually sharp ,0
Fr ,0
"Hunwicke wrote this afternoon , “ This cheap and vulgar ritual humiliation exemplifies the extent to which P[ope ] F[rancis ] is presiding over a bully - boy Church in which midget bishops and minicardinals compete to defeat each other in the sycophancy stakes ",1
"Just as Tom Weinandy has , in effect , just said ",0
” ,0
"As I write this , the outrage is doing the opposite of dying down , and is surely a sign of how fed up Catholics – even those who would never identify themselves as Traditionalists – have become with this pope and his cadre of episcopal bullies ",1
"In his letter , Fr ",0
Weinandy made a point of stating that he is not signatory to the Filial Correction or any other public declaration against Pope Francis’ agenda ,0
"In fact , a former student of his wrote to me today saying , ",0
“ I see that Fr ,0
Thomas Weinandy has been squashed ,0
"He was one of my professors in Patristics at Oxford and he was one of the most mild - mannered , least confrontational , kindest academics one could have hoped to meet ",0
"To me , the fact that he has chosen to write to express his concern about the crisis in the church and the papacy is very significant ",0
"He is neither a traditionalist , nor a controversialist , but a humble and straightforward Friar who is clear - thinking and entirely loyal to the Church and Her teaching ",0
I would be surprised now if we were not see more of this sort of letter / exercise of conscience ,0
I imagine that it ’s going to become harder and harder for men of conscience and position to sit on the fence ,0
” ,0
"When I posted it , this assessment was backed up by Joseph Shaw , the head of the UK ’s Latin Mass Society and the spokesman for the Filial Correction , who wrote , “ This is absolutely right ",0
Not a man to seek out confrontation ,0
” ,0
The Crux piece offered a succinct bullet point list of Fr ,0
Weinandy ’s concerns ,0
He said the pope is … ,0
Fostering “ chronic confusion ,0
” ,0
“ Demeaning ” the importance of doctrine ,0
Appointing bishops who “ scandalize ” believers with dubious “ teaching and pastoral practice ,1
” ,0
Giving prelates who object the impression they ’ll be “ marginalized or worse ” if they speak out ,1
Causing faithful Catholics to “ lose confidence in their supreme shepherd ,1
” ,1
Our friend Edward Pentin has reproduced the full text of the letter at the National Catholic Register which is definitely worth a read ,0
Fr ,0
"Weinandy sent the letter to the pope on July 31 , the Feast of St. Ignatius of Loyola ",0
"Like the Dubia cardinals , he said he made it public only after the pope had ignored it for months ",0
"Notable in his critique is its distinct pastoral flavour , his concern on the effect the situation is having on ordinary people ",0
"The pope , he said , seems “ to censor and even mock ” critics of Amoris Laetitia for their desire to interpret it in keeping with Catholic teaching , and in doing so is committing a “ kind of calumny … alien to the nature of the Petrine ministry ",0
” ,0
"In an interview with Crux , Weinandy said he is not afraid of reprisals but “ more concerned about the good that my letter might do ",0
"” The letter “ expresses the concerns of many more people than just me , ordinary people who ’ve come to me with their questions and apprehensions ",0
I wanted them to know that I listened ,0
” ,0
"“ I have done what I believe God wanted me to do,[1 ] ” he said ",1
"In fact , Fr ",0
"Weinandy has bolstered my own “ Great Clarifier ” theory , saying that this pontificate , and the lack of response to it from priests and bishops , is being allowed by God in order to reveal “ just how weak is the faith of many within the Church , ” He added that Francis has revealed that many in the Church “ hold harmful theological and pastoral views ",1
” ,0
"Which inevitably brings to mind other responses that have not been quite so clear , nor so pastoral ",0
"When Cardinal Muller was removed abruptly from his position as head of the CDF , the conservative Catholic world wailed that it was another case of a “ good ” prelate being got rid of ",0
"And it seems clear from the way it was done , and the way Francis treated Muller in general , that he was indeed got rid of ",1
But his depiction by conservative writers as a beleaguered champion of Catholic orthodoxy persecuted by the regime for his faithfulness betrays a somewhat selective memory and short attention span ,0
Ed Pentin has a long file of interviews and articles about Muller that clearly show his complete inability to make up his mind whose side he ’s on ,0
"A quick examination of Muller ’s interviews and statements reveal an irresolute and ultimately calculating mind of a man who is – so I am told by sources close to him – motivated mainly by a puerile desire to be approved of by the “ cool kids ” in the Vatican , on the one hand , and an unshakeable conviction of his own theological brilliance on the other ",1
"Most recently , on October 30th , Crux quoted him under the headline , “ Cardinal Muller backs Pope Francis against critics of ‘ Amoris Laetitia’ ” in which the former head of the CDF has at last climbed on board the Kasperian train on reception of Communion for unrepentant adulterers ",0
"Signaling furiously with the trendy FrancisChurch buzzwords and even trendier blithering incoherence , Muller writes that “ mitigating factors in guilt , ” can lead , couples in “ an uncertain marital situation ” through a “ path of repentance ” – always “ accompanied ” by an exquisitely sensitive confessor – to a point where the reception of Communion is no longer sinful ",1
Presumably because adultery itself is no longer sinful ,1
"Or sacrilege either , I guess ",0
Or something ,0
"Somehow the “ new evangelization ” is involved in this , though it ’s unclear how exactly it makes adultery and sacrilege OK ",0
"Also , it ’s very important to fulfill the Sunday Mass obligation , and as everyone knows , one ca n’t possibly go to Mass on a Sunday without receiving Communion ",0
"We hear again , as we did incessantly from the Kasperians at the Synods , about the hard case of the poor , poor woman who has been abandoned by the first husband , and who “ finds no other way out than to entrust oneself to a kind - hearted person , ” … with whom , I guess , she has also no choice but to have sexual relations ",1
Because of kind - heartedness ,1
"Anyway , the result of this is a “ marriage - like relationship ” about which confessors have to be very careful not to say mean things ",0
Or be too “ extreme ” ,0
"It ’s very important for him to avoid a “ cheap adaptation to the relativistic Zeitgeist , ” on one side , and a “ cold application of the dogmatic commandments and the canonical rules , ” on the other ",1
Because that could be too polarizing ,0
And mean ,0
"And anyway , sins of the flesh are n’t the worst things ever ",0
"There are , like , “ different levels ” of gravity , you know ? ",0
"And , like , it depends on the type of sin , right ? ",0
"“ Spirit ’s sins ” like spiritual pride and avarice and stuff , are worse than “ sins of the flesh , ” you know ? ",0
"Which are , like , only a result of “ human weakness , ” right ? ",0
"Apparently the real problem with this whole thing has been that the Kasperian kerfuffle has totally been blown way , way , WAY out of proportion , and the “ polarization ” it has caused has been “ regrettable ” ",0
"The question of Communion for divorced and civilly “ remarried ” Catholics , he said , has been “ falsely elevated to the rank of a decisive question of Catholicism and a measure of ideological comparison in order to decide whether one is conservative or liberal , in favor or against the pope ",1
” ,1
"For years under Pope Benedict , Muller was engaged in an open war with the German episcopate who insisted that they were going to allow Communion for the divorced and remarried , no matter what Rome said , even threatening to go into schism if they did n’t get their way[2 ] ",1
"Muller , with little backing from Pope Benedict – who appeared content to allow his CDF prefect and the Germans shout out their differences – and with outright opposition from Francis , did indeed strive to hold the line ",0
The fact that Francis orchestrated the Synods to undermine him was certainly not his fault ,0
And it is difficult to imagine anyone being in a worse position than he was at the time ,0
"But since then , Muller has demonstrated very little of his former grit , instead attempting from one day to the next to appease both sides ",0
"Reportedly removed from CDF – and of course lionized by “ conservatives ” – for his mild and equivocating opposition to Amoris Laetitia , Muller has gone back and forth in what can easily be seen as a desperate attempt to find friends in both camps ",1
With this in mind one could be forgiven for not taking his October 30th essay too seriously ,0
Perhaps one of the good effects to come from Fr ,0
Weinandy ’s persecution will be to demonstrate how a pastor of the Catholic Church is supposed to act ,0
"As my friend said , maybe “ it ’s going to become harder and harder for men of conscience and position to sit on the fence , ” assuming there are any left ",0

"[ 1 ] In this interview , Fr ",0
"Weinandy gave a remarkable story of how his prayer for a “ sign ” that he ought to write the letter was very specifically answered : “ If you want me to write something , you have to give me a clear sign , ” Weinandy recalls saying ",0
"“ Tomorrow morning , I ’m going to Saint Mary Major ’s to pray , and then I am going to Saint John Lateran ",0
"After that , I ’m coming back to Saint Peter ’s to have lunch with a seminary friend of mine ",0
"” “ During that interval , I must meet someone that I know but have not seen in a very long time , and would never expect to see in Rome at this time ",0
"That person can not be from the United States , Canada or Great Britain ",0
"Moreover , that person has to say to me , ‘ Keep up the good writing’ ",0
"” Weinandy said , exactly that happened the next day , in a chance meeting with an archbishop he ’d known a long time ago but not seen for over twenty years , who congratulated him for a book on the Incarnation and then said the right words , “ Keep up the good writing ",0
"” “ There was no longer any doubt in my mind that Jesus wanted me to write something , ” Weinandy said ",0
[ 2 ] It ’s notable that these howling tantrums from the German bishops halted abruptly about the same time as Cardinal Kasper gave his infamous consistory speech in February 2014 ,1
An Anti - Semitic Purge At McGill University ,0
"​Despite suffering several public and humiliating reversals in various forums and venues , those pushing for boycotts , divestment and sanctions ( BDS ) against Israel have not dispensed with their pernicious campaign of hate ",1
"The latest outrage perpetrated by BDS activists occurred at McGill University , where a Jewish student and two non - Jewish students identified as pro - Israel were removed from their positions as directors of the Students Society of McGill University ( SSMU ) ",1
"At the end of his second year , Noah Lew , who is currently third year undergraduate student at McGill University , applied to serve as Director of the School ’s student society ",0
"He was warned by others who had prior dealings with the SSMU , to keep his Jewish identity secret lest he sabotage his chances ",1
This is the atmosphere that Jewish students and supporters of Israel must endure on a daily basis at McGill ,0
The toxic environment is due almost exclusively to an active and vocal presence of BDS agitators on campus ,1
Lew followed the advice and was elected as a board member ,0
His “ secret ” was intact ,0
BDS provocateurs at McGill had relentlessly tried and failed to pass boycott resolutions against Israel ,1
"In fact , three attempts within an 18-month period were quashed ",1
"Finally , in June 2016 , SSMU ’s Judicial Board ruled that the BDS campaign and efforts to institute it at McGill ran counter to the McGill ’s undergraduate student union constitution ",0
"The Board ’s ruling , which is called a “ reference , ” was then referred to SSMU ’s directors for ratification ",0
SSMU ’s Board of Directors addressed the issue more than a year after the “ reference ,0
” Lew and other board members passionately advocated in favor of ratification and their arguments ultimately prevailed over the naysayers ,1
The malevolent BDS campaign at McGill had belatedly come to an ignominious end ; or so we thought ,1
Lew and two other directors identified as either Jewish or pro - Israel became instant targets of a campaign of hate laced with blatant anti - Semitic overtones ,1
Campus BDS groups held several meetings to formulate a response and founded the so - called “ Democratize SSMU ” movement ,0
But Democratize SSMU was anything but democratic ,1
Its raison d'être was to seek the removal of Jewish and anti - BDS students from SSMU ’s Board of Directors and place BDS back on the agenda ,0
"As an aside , one of the more vocal proponents of BDS at McGill is a rancid character named Igor Sadikov , who in February posted a comment on twitter advocating violence against “ Zionists ",0
"” As a result , he was forced to resign his position as an SSMU director but dodged an impeachment effort to have him stripped of his position at McGill ’s Arts Undergraduate Society ",0
Sadikov made light of his “ punch a Zionist ” tweet calling it a “ misguided joke ,1
” It does not appear that Sadikov was subjected to any form of school disciplinary action despite the fact that his call for violence violated McGill ’s Code of Conduct ,0
McGill ’s BDS Action Network actively campaigned against Lew and two other board members because of their links to Jewish groups and anti - BDS stances ,0
Democratize SSMU shamefully highlighted Lew ’s ethnicity as a reason for his removal ,1
"An enlightened , progressive school was suddenly transformed into something harking back to the days of Nazi Germany and the Nuremberg Laws ",1
"In October , SSMU ’s General Assembly moved to ratify the 12-member Board of Directors ",0
"According to Lew , “ historically , the Board of Directors had been ratified as a bloc , all 12 at a time ",0
” But BDS activists who showed up for the General Assembly ratification forced the voting to occur on an individual basis rather than a block as was the accepted protocol ,0
"In this manner , BDS/ Democratize SSMU activists managed to pick off their opponents one at a time ",0
It was repulsive display leftist - fascist bigotry at its worst ,1
The bigoted BDS provocateurs applauded as Lew and the other two board members were removed from their posts ,1
"But this time , they may have gone too far ",0
"Even by BDS standards , their manifestly anti - Semitic campaign antics were beyond the pale ",1
BDS activists generally avoid reference to “ Jews ” by name because it is impolitic and commonly substitute “ Zionists ” for Jews even though most of us are cognizant of their true intentions ,0
"But in the instant case , McGill ’s BDS campaigners dispensed with their traditional charade and overtly launched their attack against Jews ",1
"The vitriolic BDS campaign immediately sparked outrage among watchdog groups and politicians prompting McGill principal , Suzanne Fortier , to announce that the school would be conducting an investigation into the matter ",1
"Even SSMU president , Muna Tojiboeva , voiced support for Lew and expressed the belief that antisemitism played a key role in the ousting the three board members ",0
"One can only hope that Fortier takes the issue seriously and conducts a proper investigation , which leads to disciplinary action ",0
"Judging by past “ investigations ” conducted by other schools – SFSU , CUNY and UCI , to name a few – I am not optimistic ",1

"Powell , who returned to Goldman in a senior role after leaving her job as President Donald Trump ’s deputy national security adviser , is said to be strongly considering the job but also weighing family concerns ",0
"Powell already lives in New York , where the U.N. is based , but has young children and left the administration in part to spend more time with family ",0
She is also said to be happy in her job at Goldman ,0
"Born in Egypt and raised in the United States , Powell is well liked by Trump as well as the president ’s daughter Ivanka and son - in - law , Jared Kushner ",0
But she is already coming under criticism from some conservatives on social media who maintain that Powell is a “ globalist ” not closely enough aligned with Trump ’s “ America first ” approach to foreign policy ,1
Trump on Tuesday described Powell as a “ person I would consider ” when asked about her possible nomination ,0
“ She is under consideration ,0

"Goldman Sachs Group Inc. partner Dina Powell has told some colleagues that she ’s leaning against leaving the firm to rejoin the Trump administration as ambassador to the United Nations , according to two people familiar with the matter ",0
"President Donald Trump has called Powell about the job twice , first on Sunday -- before current United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley announced her resignation -- and again on Wednesday , the people said ",0
"He made it clear that he ’s interested in the idea of appointing Powell to the position , they said , though he has also talked to other candidates ",0
"Powell is not only a partner at Goldman Sachs , which has a sordid history of its own , but also worked in the George W. Bush administration ",1
"As for her ties with Goldman Sachs , Breitbart reported the following : ",0
"1 – When she served as president of the Goldman Sachs Foundation , the philanthropic arm of the Wall Street giant , Powell repeatedly partnered with the Clinton Global Initiative for a globalist women ’s project that served as the centerpiece of Goldman ’s foundation ",0
2 – Powell ’s organization joined with the Clinton Global Initiative for globalist giving projects ,0
3 – Powell ’s Goldman Sachs fund directly donated to the controversial Clinton Foundation ,0

"5 – Powell was a featured speaker at a Clinton Global Initiative event alongside Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton ’s former campaign chief , John Podesta ",0
"6 – There are crossover connections between employees paid by Powell ’s 10,000 Women and the Clintons ",0
7 – Powell served on a global group alongside Hillary Clinton ,0

Daniel Greenfield wrote about Dina Habib Powell : ,0
“ The media dubbed her the Republican Huma Abedin ,0
She ’s been one of the most powerful women in two Republican administrations ,0
She ’s friends with Valerie Jarrett … .Habib Powell had all the right friends ,0
Like Valerie Jarrett ,0
Arianna Huffington praised the White House for bringing her in ,0
Her ex - husband heads up Teneo Strategy : the organization created by the same man who made the Clinton Foundation happen and which employed Huma Abedin ,0
"You could see her posing next to Huma , Arianna and a Saudi princess ",0

The ATFP was originally Rashid Khalidi ’s American Committee on Jerusalem ,0
Khalidi was the former PLO spokesman at the center of the Obama tape scandal ,0
And Habib Powell was there as a presenter at the Middle East Institute after a speech by the PLO ’s Hanan Ashrawi … .Dina Habib Powell is a deep part of the Republican establishment ,0
Her top role at the NSC represents McMaster ’s vision for our approach to Islam ,0
And it ’s an echo of the failed approach of the Bush years ,0
Flynn made the NSC into a tool that matched Trump ’s vision ,0
McMaster is remaking it to match Jeb Bush ’s vision ,0
” ,0
Greenfield also adds : ,0
"When visiting Egypt , Habib - Powell had assured the locals of how Bush , after September 11 , “ visited a mosque , took off his shoes and paid his respects ",0
"” “ I see the president talk of Islam as a religion of peace , I see him host an iftar every year , ” she gushed ",0
K.T. ,0
McFarland had written that “ Global Islamist jihad is at war with all of Western civilization ,0

"While President Trump fights to restrict Muslim immigration , at his side is the woman who had once bragged on CNN , “ Over 90 % of student visas are now issued in under a week , and that is in the Middle East ",0
” ,0
Pamela Geller also pointed out why Powell should not be the UN ambassador ,0
Dina Habib Powell is a deep part of the Republican establishment ,0
"She is part of the swamp , part of the willfully ignorant McMaster crowd that clearly opposed Trump ’s agenda ",1
"Back in 2017 , she resigned her post of Deputy National Security Adviser NSC under Islamic apologist H. R. McMaster , whose failed views she shared ",0
"McMaster subscribed to the Obama view that Islamic terrorism has nothing to do with Islam , despite the numerous Islamic texts and teachings that incite Muslims to wage war against unbelievers ",0
McMaster went so far as to claim that devout jihadis were “ irreligious ,0
” McMaster forced out superb K.T. ,0
"McFarland from her role as Deputy National Security Advisor and inserted Dina Habib - Powell , former Bush gatekeeper whose pals included Huma Abedin and Valerie Jarrett ",0
"Again , and I have asked this before , how do you fight the Deep State by putting Deep State operatives in these positions ? ",1
How do you drain the swamp by adding to it ? ,1
The answer is clear : You do n't ,0

London Borough With Highest Percentage Of Muslims In UK Votes To Ban Trump From Entering ,0
I ’m sure President Trump is deeply disappointed in not being able to enter Tower Hamlets ,1
"But this ridiculous exercise in virtue - signaling , even though it has not ( yet ) been taken up by the Home Office , only highlights Britain ’s hypocrisy and double standards regarding who can enter the country and who can not ",1
Pamela Geller and I are banned from entering the country for the crime of telling the truth about Islam and jihad ,1
"Meanwhile , Britain has a steadily lengthening record of admitting jihad preachers without a moment of hesitation ",1
"Syed Muzaffar Shah Qadri ’s preaching of hatred and jihad violence was so hardline that he was banned from preaching in Pakistan , but the UK Home Office welcomed him into Britain ",0
"The UK Home Office also admitted Shaykh Hamza Sodagar into the country , despite the fact that he has said : “ If there ’s homosexual men , the punishment is one of five things ",1
"One – the easiest one maybe – chop their head off , that ’s the easiest ",1
Second – burn them to death ,1
Third – throw ’em off a cliff ,1
Fourth – tear down a wall on them so they die under that ,1
Fifth – a combination of the above ,1

Receipt Shows Paddock Had Another Guest in His Room Before Shooting ,0
This report was originally published by Paul Joseph Watson at Infowars ,0
An image posted on Facebook by a man who claims he served Stephen Paddock room service shows that the gunman was with a guest during his time at the Mandalay Bay hotel four days before the massacre took place ,0
"The receipt shows an employee named Antonio served two guests an “ IRA_MB , ” which means “ In Room Dining , Mandalay Bay ",0
” ,0
The table number is “ 32135 ” – which equates to Paddock ’s room number ( 135 ) on the 32nd floor ,0
"Paddock ordered a burger , a bagel with cream cheese , a potato soup , one bottle of water and two Pepsis , suggesting that there was another person eating with him in the room ",0
The receipt shows the number “ 2 ” next to the word “ Guests ” ,0
"The date on the receipt also says September 27 , whereas authorities assert that Paddock checked in the day after on September 28 ",0
Paddock ’s guest could not have been his girlfriend Marilou Danley because she was in the Philippines at the time ,0
"The individual who posted the receipt appears to have deleted it from his Facebook page , although the page still shows that he works at Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino ",0
"Another source told Laura Loomer that the gunman actually checked in on September 25 , three days before authorities said he did ",0
Source who works at @MandalayBay said # StephenPaddock had the suite since Sep. 25th ,0
Why did police lie and say he checked in on Sep. 28th ? ,0
"pic.twitter.com/WivxGRqB6W — Laura Loomer ( @LauraLoomer ) October 4 , 2017 ",0
Authorities must surely now be on the hunt for whoever Paddock dined with in order to ascertain whether this individual was involved in the plot and whether or not it was the same woman who reportedly told concert - goers they were “ going to die ” 45 minutes before the shooting took place ,0

Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump ’s Face ,1
The president is doubling down on an increasingly risky candidate ,0
Justice Anthony Kennedy gave President Donald Trump the biggest political gift possible when he announced his resignation in the spring ,1
"Even though not everything that ’s gone wrong is Trump ’s fault , he has managed to make a complete hash of Brett Kavanaugh ’s nomination to fill the empty seat on the court ",1
It ’s a good example of how badly Trump does his job more than a year and a half into his administration ,1
"To begin with , Trump has outsourced his judicial nominations to outside , party - aligned groups , the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society ",0
That included an unusually central role for the Federalist Society ’s Leonard Leo ,0
That was n’t entirely a Trump mistake ,0
His decision during the campaign to release a list of potential justices drafted by Leo reflected the reality - TV star ’s weakness as a presidential candidate ,1
"The party was worried that Trump might turn out not to be a conservative ; to reassure them , he publicly committed to their top goal ",0
"In some ways , that ’s successful coalition - building , and what he ’s done in office is just keeping his promises on judges ",0
"Still , it ’s one thing to form an alliance with conservatives ; it ’s another to turn the whole process over to them ",0
We do n’t know to what extent Kavanaugh was Trump ’s choice and to what extent he was manipulated into choosing him ,0
"We have plenty of evidence that Trump is easily manipulated by those around him , and that Kavanaugh is a good fit for Trump ’s biases : The judge has Ivy League credentials and he passes Trump ’s cut - of - his - jib test by looking the part ",1
1,0
"Either way , Kavanaugh was a poor choice from the point of view of good presidenting ",0
The judge was certain to be a highly controversial selection from the start ,0
"After all , he had been a highly controversial selection for his current circuit court seat , eventually getting confirmed with only four Democratic votes after a long delay ",0
"Kavanaugh is a longtime Republican operative , a hard - liner during both the Vince Foster and Monica Lewinsky investigations ",0
"Nominating him , rather than a conservative with similar views but a different background , was bound to stir up trouble ",0
"It was also true , as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reportedly warned , that normal disclosure of Kavanaugh ’s record , especially his service during the George W. Bush administration , was going to delay confirmation even more ",0
"Senate Republicans dealt with that problem by deciding to not bother with any Kavanaugh documents that could n’t be produced rapidly , which further riled up the Democrats and gave that party some good talking points ",0
2,0
Sometimes it ’s worth taking risks ,0
Presidents who shy away from anything that ’s not a sure thing can fail to exploit opportunities ,0
"It ’s just very hard to see any upside for Trump in choosing Kavanaugh instead of a safer , but still very conservative , other option ",0
3,0
"When serious charges of sexual misconduct were raised against Kavanaugh , Trump decided to stick with him instead of moving on to another candidate ",0
"It ’s still not clear that Kavanaugh ’s nomination is doomed , but it ’s certainly in severe trouble ",1
"Losing a high - profile fight is always going to hurt a president , which is why they should take care to avoid high - risk , low - reward conflicts ",0
But there ’s an art to minimizing damage ,0
And Trump has n’t learned it yet ,1
"For one thing , the president has made this an extremely high - profile episode by stringing out the process as the accusations against Kavanaugh gained credibility and even multiplied ",1
"Whether that matters in terms of public opinion for Trump is unclear , but it certainly is n’t good for any Republican senators caught up in the middle , along with any other candidates who have had to weigh in only to find the facts as they knew them constantly changing ",0
"It ’s also the case that the more negative information comes out , the more it appears that the Trump and his White House staff failed to do their jobs in vetting and managing Kavanaugh ",1
"If the nomination had been pulled right after Christine Blasey Ford made her initial assertions about Kavanaugh , the public might have concluded that it was n’t Trump ’s fault that a previously unaired accusation came to light ",0
"Meanwhile , Trump ’s behavior has been as erratic as ever ",0
"First he said that Brasey had to be heard ; then he attacked her in terms that were a slur on all women who have been assaulted without immediately reporting it to the police , and he also blamed the Senate for not voting before she came forward ",1
"He sometimes praises Kavanaugh , but also let it be known that he thought the nominee had performed badly in his Fox News interview ",0
"The White House demanded a final up and down vote on Tuesday ; by Wednesday , he was saying that the nomination would die if Kavanaugh did n’t do well before the Judiciary Committee on Thursday ",0
"The sum of all this has been , as in many other episodes , that Trump and his White House are a gang that ca n’t shoot straight and that he ’s eager to blame his allies and lash out at his enemies in ugly ways when things go wrong ",1
"A botched nomination matters because allies will be less likely to trust Trump , not just on Supreme Court choices , but on any initiative ",0
"And , for that matter , they ’ll be less likely to trust him when he asserts that there ’s nothing remaining for Special Counsel Robert Mueller to reveal ",0
"Trump ’s professional reputation is already terrible , but everything counts ",0
"As the political scientist Richard Neustadt said , political elites are constantly evaluating and re - evaluating the president ",1
"Trump is hurting himself right now , and will have hurt himself more if Kavanaugh is not confirmed ",0
"And yes , I call it the cut - of - his - jib test quite deliberately ",1
"It 's no surprise that someone who hires based on what he thinks someone doing that job should look like , which seems to be based on hazy old - time Hollywood casting , would wind up with fewer women in his administration than any of his recent predecessors ",1
"I 've argued that too much disclosure is required , and that Democrats ( and any wavering Republicans ) had more than enough information to make up their mind ",0
I still think that 's true ,0
"But it did leave Republicans vulnerable to claims about transparency which were likely to be popular -- most people , and the entire press corps , love transparency -- and vulnerable to bombshells in the documentary record which had n't been initially disclosed ",1
"In the event , that 's not what 's causing the trouble , but still it 's an example of Trump taking needless risks ",0
Some have speculated that Kavanaugh would be especially likely to rule in Trump 's favor if any cases stemming from the Robert Mueller investigation wind up at the high court ,0
Perhaps ,0
"There are plenty of other partisan , conservative judges , and plenty of conservative judges who lean towards an expansive view of presidential powers ",1
"And if Kavanaugh is really an outlier on that issue , then he wo n't be in the majority on any future decision anyway ",0
"So , no , I do n't think there 's any good reason to think Kavanaugh would be especially helpful to Trump compared to others he could have selected ",0
Number Of Puerto Rico Residents Without Clean Water And Electricity Keeps Rising ,0

"The island ’s electrical grid was all but completely destroyed during Hurricane Maria , and many are still struggling without the most basic of necessities ",0
This news comes just one day after Puerto Rico ’s Governor Ricardo Rossello asked the federal government for an additional $ 4.6 billion in funding beyond the Trump administration ’s request last week for $ 29 billion from Congress for relief efforts ,0
"“ Puerto Rico has experienced a natural disaster of a magnitude not seen in over a century , and we are doing everything possible to address the needs of the American citizens of Puerto Rico during this time of crisis , ” Rosselló wrote ",1
"“ However , the unprecedented level of destruction , coupled with the almost complete shut - down of business in Puerto Rico , have made it impossible for us to meet the considerable human needs without the measures proposed above , ” he added ",1
The White House also announced Monday that it would allow a 10-day waiver temporarily blocking the Jones Act to expire ,0
"This is devastating news for those living in Puerto Rico , as foreign ships can no longer bring aid to the hurricane - ravaged island from U.S. ports ",1
Officials still expect it to be six more months before electricity can be fully restored to Puerto Rico ,0
"As the days have become weeks , the weeks will become months , and survival will get more difficult ",1
Many are now fleeing to the mainland United States just so that they can survive ,0
"The economy in Puerto Rico is at a standstill , and without clean drinking water , many are finding life too difficult should they remain on the island and isolated ",0
Puerto Rico says to receive $ 16 bln in federal disaster aid ,0
By Nick Brown ,0
Feb 9 ( Reuters ) - Puerto Rico said on Friday it will receive $ 16 billion in federal aid under a disaster recovery package signed on Friday by U.S. President Donald Trump ,0
"That money includes nearly $ 7 billion announced on Wednesday and will help the bankrupt U.S. territory recover from September 's Hurricane Maria , according to a statement on Friday from Governor Ricardo Rossello and Jenniffer Gonzalez , Puerto Rico 's nonvoting member of the U.S. Congress ",0
Rossello said on Wednesday that Puerto Rico would get $ 4.9 billion to shore up its near - insolvent Medicaid system and another $ 2 billion or so under the Community Development Block Grant ( CDBG ) program to repair its destroyed electric grid ,0
"On Friday , Rossello and Gonzalez said the island would receive a total of $ 11 billion under CDBG , a program run by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ",0
"The additional portion would be used to help local businesses and repair and build new homes , they said ",0
"In addition to a slow recovery from Hurricane Maria , its worst natural disaster in 90 years , Puerto Rico is navigating the largest bankruptcy in U.S. government history , with a combined $ 120 billion in bond and pension debt ",0
"The aid announced on Friday provides just a fraction of the $ 94.4 billion Rossello has said the island needs to recover from cataclysmic damage to its infrastructure and housing stock , although Puerto Rico is eligible to participate in other programs that could increase the aid to $ 45 billion , according to Friday 's statement ",1
Congress could also appropriate more money later ,0
The governor has asked Congress for $ 46 billion in CDBG funding alone ,0
"Home damage in Puerto Rico , where the poverty rate is around 46 percent , was exacerbated by the existence of hundreds of thousands of sub - standard """""""" informal """""""" homes , which are typically built by the owners themselves , without permits and often in squatter communities ",1
""""""""" The work carried out in Washington - together with resident commissioner Jenniffer González - was able to deliver the message of the urgency of an allocation of funds that meets the needs of the Island , """""""" the governor said in Friday 's statement ",0
"The disaster aid package signed by Trump on Friday - around $ 90 billion in total - covers a number of major disasters , including Hurricanes Irma , Harvey and Maria , as well as the recent California wildfires ",0

According to the mayors : ,0
"Strengthening the Regulation of Gun Sales and Dealers , including : Limiting the number of guns a person may purchase in a single transaction or in a month or other specified period of time ; ",0
Banning replica handguns ; ,0
Increasing inspections of licensed gun dealers ; and ,0
"Targeting and holding responsible gun dealers who break the law by knowingly selling guns to straw purchasers ; Banning Assault Weapons and Large - Capacity Magazines , including : Reinstating a strengthened , effective ban on military - style assault weapons , such as AK-47s , and their component parts ; and ",0

How any of this is consistent with support for the Second Amendment is anyone 's guess ,1
I think they throw that language in to cover for the fact that they are attacking it head on and attacking the rights of the people ,1
How does any of this stop gun violence ? ,0
It does n't ,0
"What it does do is infringe on the rights of teachers , law - abiding citizens who want to purchase several guns which they will use lawfully , sides with criminals against law - abiding citizens as it opposes stand your ground and other measures written specifically to protect people who would normally be victims of crime ",1
"Banning semi - automatic weapons does n't stop crime either , as we 've pointed out before , and the statistics are available for anyone to see that gun violence did n't go down one bit during the decade of the Clinton / Feinstein assault weapons ban ",0

Stop Appeasing the Democrats ,0

"From the playground to geopolitics , appeasing an aggressor invites only more aggression ",0
This timeless truth of human nature is one that we moderns ca n’t seem to accept ,0
"We reflexively assume that a rational accommodation or concessions will be reciprocated by those proven to be ready to use any means necessary to achieve their aims , no matter how amoral , unfair , or vicious ",1
"Brett Kavanaugh ’s confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court illustrate that this false assumption leads only to more demands , and ultimately to defeat ",0
"The last - minute accusations from Christine Blasey Ford , a woman who claims that decades ago Kavanaugh groped her at a high school party , and Deborah Ramirez , who accused Kavanaugh of exposing himself to her at a frat party at Yale , are transparent acts of aggression against the judge and Republicans , one engineered by the Democrats ",1
Senator Dianne Feinstein sat for months on Ford ’s letter and then––just as the Dems did in 1991with Anita Hill ’s charges of sexual harassment against Clarence Thomas ’s during his hearings––released it only when Kavanaugh appeared to be heading for confirmation ,1
Feinstein still has n’t given the Judiciary Committee an unredacted copy of the letter ,0
"A few weeks after Ford went public , and after Kavanaugh said he had dairies from that summer detailing his whereabouts , The New Yorker published Ramirez ’s account of a drunken party filled with obscene drinking games where he exposed himself to Ramirez ",0
"Given that the Democrats had made public in advance their intention to derail the hearings and confirmation by any means possible , the timing of both sexual assault charges reeks of premeditated contrivance intended to delay confirmation as long as possible ",1
"But in the face of this naked ploy to bork Kavanaugh and derail the confirmation process for partisan advantage , the Republicans seem to be reverting to their customary preemptive cringe ",1
All the Dems have to do is squeal “ sexism ” and Republicans start negotiating and offering concessions ,1
"Of course , after each concession comes another demand ",0
"First the Dems demanded that Ford , a long - time Democrat activist , “ be heard ",1
"” So last week the Chairman of Judiciary Committee , Chuck Grassley , granted another deadline extension for Ford to decide whether to testify before the Committee on Monday ",0
Senator Dianne Feinstein calls these concessions “ bullying deadlines ,1
"” As Feinstein put it , “ Show some heart ",0
Wait until Dr. Ford feels that she can come before the committee ,0
"” Ford does n’t “ feel ” like she can testify on Monday because she ’s afraid of flying , despite offers from the Committee to travel to her in California ",0
"Then she feared for her life because of death threats ––threats also made to Kavanaugh , his wife and two young daughters–– so she now demands enhanced security measures ",0
The Committee caved and moved the date to Thursday ,0
"So of course , Grassley having been intimidated into giving Ford a chance to address the Committee , Ramirez and her handlers are now demanding the same privilege ",0
“ Creepy Lawyer ” for porn star Stormy Daniels claims to represent a woman who also should be allowed to testify to the Senate Committee about Kavanaugh ’s partying habits while at Yale ,1
We ’ll have to see whether Grassley can find the stomach to put an end to the farce of allowing unsubstantiated charges from Democrat activists to waste the Committee ’s time ,1
"Ford and Dianne Feinstein also keep demanding an FBI investigation , even though no federal crime is being alleged , and any investigation 36 years after the offense is impossible ",0
"Ford ca n’t remember where and when the alleged assault took place , nor how she got to or went home from the party where it allegedly occurred ",0

"Another friend who reported that the school was abuzz with gossip about the attack ( which apparently took place during summer break ) , retracted her statement ",0
The two men Ford named as possible witnesses to the assault have contradicter her claims under oath ,0
And the accused Judge Kavanaugh also under oath vehemently denies the charges ,1
"Given that 36 years have passed since the incident , and the accuser ’s memory is so hazy and short on coherent details , the FBI has nothing to investigate ",0
Ramirez ’s charge is even flimsier ,0
Here ’s a catalogue from the Daily Wire : ,0
1,0
The New Yorker could not find a single witness who could put Kavanaugh at the alleged party ,0
2,0
The New York Times could not find a single person who could corroborate Ramirez ’s claims ,0
3,0
The man accused of egging on Kavanaugh denied Ramirez 's allegations and vouched for Kavanaugh ’s character ,0
4,0
A third person that Ramirez claimed was at the party says she was not there for the alleged incident ,0
5,0
"Ramirez contacted her former classmates , asking about the incident , and admitted she was not sure that Kavanaugh was the male who exposed himself ",0
6,0
A woman who claims she was “ best friends ” with Ramirez says Ramirez never mentioned the story and initially said her friend 's accusations against Kavanaugh might be “ politically motivated ,0
” ,0
7,0
"Ramirez , just like Christine Blasey Ford , is a registered Democrat and is dedicated to leftist causes ",0
8,0
Ramirez was n’t even sure her memory was correct — until she spent six days going over it with her Democrat lawyer ,1
9,0
Ramirez admits there are holes in her memory due to how much she drank at the party ,0
10,0
People who knew Ramirez after her time at Yale say that she never once mentioned the incident — until Kavanaugh 's nomination was pending ,0
"No law enforcement agency , let alone the FBI , would waste its time with an allegation of a crime decades in the past , and so patently incoherent and lacking in evidence ",0
The “ FBI investigation ” is another delaying tactic ,0
"Ford has finally agreed to testify , set for Thursday for now ",0
"But it ’s unclear whether Grassley has granted Ford any of her preposterous conditions for testifying : She will take questions from the Committee , but not from outside lawyers , who might not be as gentle as politicians with one eye on the polls ",1
Only one camera can be in the room ,0
"Kavanaugh must testify first , a grotesque inversion of our bedrock principle that an accused has the right to confront his accuser ’s charges ",1
"He ca n’t be in the room with her , apparently because she ’s still traumatized and may start experiencing flashbacks ",0
"So much for “ I am woman , hear me roar ",1
” ,0
Grassley should n’t cave on these conditions ,0
They all comprise the old tactic of serially escalating demands that can not be satisfied in order to compel your enemy to give in ,0
That Grassley and the Republicans would even participate in this absurd show trial is testimony to how deeply the progressive ideological narrative has burrowed into our social and political life ,1
"If Ford actually testifies on Thursday , or Ramirez is granted the same concession , nothing material will be gained ",0
Her accusation will not be proved true or false ,0
"We will learn nothing about Kavanaugh that makes him any less eminently qualified for the Supreme Court , nothing that can add to the thousands of pages of documents already presented to the Committee , or the hundreds of hours of the judge ’s testimony before rabid partisans and office - seekers ",1
But vetting Kavanaugh ’s qualifications is n’t the point ,0
The point is to delay confirmation by slandering Kavanaugh and baiting the Republicans into appearing to abuse victims of sexual assault ,0
Why ? ,0
"Facing his likely confirmation , the Dems , egged on by the mainstream media––especially The New Yorker , which published a story too badly sourced even for The New York Times–– are desperately attempting to obstruct and delay the process until after the midterm elections , when they hope they will retake the Senate and thus stop any more Constitutionalist judges from being confirmed to the Court for the rest of Trump ’s term ",1
The Democrats have stooped so low with these smears because they know the stakes ,1
The courts and especially the Supreme Court have been critical to the progressives’ program since Woodrow Wilson ,0
The biggest obstacle to the progressive dream of government controlled and managed by a technocratic oligarchy has been the Constitution ,0
Its divided and balanced powers were designed precisely to rein in overreaching ambition and concentrations of power ,0
Hence the Constitutional order must be subverted by the Supreme Court and its unaccountable justices enjoying lifelong tenure ,0
"But if Kavanaugh is confirmed , there will be five reliably Constitutionalist justices on the bench , who are unlikely to tolerate judicial usurpation of Congress ’s law - making powers ",0
That ’s why this current nomination is a hill the Dems are willing to beclown themselves on ,1
Given how obviously partisan and hypocritical this ploy is––doesn’t Keith Ellison ’s accuser deserve to be heard and believed too ? ,1
––why has Grassley so far allowed himself to be played by the Dems ? ,1
"Because Republicans fear the backlash from all those women voters who presumably agree with the fundamentalist feminists , and insist that every accusation of sexual assault , no matter how much it ’s unsupported by corroborating evidence or even plausibility , must be believed ",1
This contention itself is an expression of the radical feminist narrative of innate male feral sexuality that makes them sexual predators ,1
The irony is that today ’s feminists have been willing to sacrifice the earlier narrative of female power and agency that had been stifled by traditional views of the sexes and their capabilities ,0
"Instead , now women are Victorian hothouse flowers too delicate to make their way through their lives without the paternal federal government protecting them with its coercive power ",1
"Women have exchanged one form of dependence , and one double standard for another ",0
The Dems are using Ford and Ramirez as part of the Democrats’ transparently dishonest delaying tactics because they know that most Republicans have accepted this duplicitous feminist narrative and fear challenging it ,1
"Especially after the recent spate of sexual assault charges––many of them true , some false , others contested–– politicians consider bucking the narrative to be as politically suicidal as proposing to reform Social Security and Medicare ",1
"It ’s the new third rail of American politics , one that transcends party affiliation ",0
"Hence the widespread virtue - signaling on the part even of conservative writers who preface their comments about Ford and Ramirez with prologues full of truisms about how horrible sexual assault is , how its self - proclaimed victims “ must be heard , ” and how churlish and sexist it is to question the truth of any charge ",0
Grown - ups know all that and do n’t have to be reminded every time the subject arises ,0
The Dems know that most Republicans come to this conflict with the huge disadvantage that results from accepting your opponent ’s dubious ideology and dishonest narrative ,1
"The progressive party can dare the Republicans to ignore the endless specious demands , stop the show - trial , and proceed to a vote on Kavanaugh , because they know the Republicans , fearful of the “ optics , ” will cave ",0
"They know that the eleven male Republican Senators on the Judiciary Committee dread the # MeToo movement casting them as knuckle - dragging Neanderthal sexists who want to “ silence ” the accuser with their “ cavalier treatment of a sexual assault survivor , ” as one Ford lawyer has said ",1
Republicans still do n’t get that no amount of appeasement will stop the left from demonizing them anyway ,1
"Just ask Boy Scout Mitt Romney , who was savaged for his innocuous “ binders full of women ",1
” ,0
"And do n’t forget , the old sorta , kinda moderate Democrats like Feinstein and Chuck Schumer , who now have joined the crowd of trendoid socialists armed with torches and pitch - forks , will go along because they ’re frightened of their party ’s increasingly rabid left - wing base ",1
What can we do to end these confirmation circuses ? ,1
Just stop holding them ,0
There ’s nothing in the Constitution that says the Senate ’s power to give “ advice and consent ” to the president regarding his nominee must entail days of televised hearings replete with caterwauling protestors and grandstanding Senators who ’ve already made - up their minds ,1
"Invite written questions from the Senate , then schedule one day for the nominee to respond ",0
"Do n’t put it on television , but make public a written transcript ",0
"Remove the television cameras , and attention - craving , politically ambitious Senators will be gone like a cool breeze ",1
"For now , Grassley needs to end this farce if Ford does n’t show up on Thursday or continues to negotiate for more delays and concessions ",1
No more concessions ,0
No more delays ,0
No more ceding control of the process to Democrat Party lawyers ,1
Do n’t give Ramirez the time of day ,0
"Hold the vote no later than Thursday , or Friday if Ford does show up ",0
"Make Senators go on the record with their votes , and hold them to account in November ",0
"Put to the test the Dems’ claims that a critical mass of women , many of them with sons they do n’t want falsely accused , believes the fundamentalist feminist narrative and will vote accordingly ",1
"To borrow Churchill ’s definition of appeasement , stop feeding the alligator in the hopes that you will be eaten last ",1
For fifty years the Democrats have proven they will demonize conservatives as racist and sexist no matter how often they bow and scrape ,1
How about acting on principle for a change and shoot the alligator ,1

"Eastern leaders , most notably in Poland , have followed his lead ",0

"Orban said on Sunday that Europe faces a critical fissure between nation states of the East and the West , which he called an """""""" immigrant zone , a mixed population world that heads in a direction different from ours """""""" ",1

Orban also said the Hungarian opposition had failed to heed the call of history when it opposed his toughness on migrants ,0

"Orban has conflated the issue of immigration with the image of Soros , 87 , whose name was used in a tough anti - migrant bill sent to Parliament on Wednesday ",0

Eyewitness Confessional : There Was An Active Shooter Targeting The Bellagio Hotel During The Las Vegas Massacre ,0
"In yet another astonishing eyewitness report that contradicts the official story surrounding the worst mass shooting in American history , a married couple who were celebrating their 10th anniversary in Las Vegas at the time of the shooting have come forward to reveal that there was an active shooter inside the Bellagio Hotel around the same time that supposed lone gunman Stephen Paddock was found dead ",1
"During the confessional , a Canadian man by the name of Jeff detailed the fact that he and his wife were in the Bellagio Resort and Casino around 11:20pm on the night of the shooting when panic broke out in the hotels lobby ",0
Jeff begins the interview by making clear his belief that there were multiple active shooters targeting different places in Las Vegas on the night of the attack ,0
"“ First of all , I think what needs to be said is that , from my perspective , there were multiple events that occurred around Las Vegas , up and down the Strip that night ",0
"It was n’t just centralized around the Mandalay Hotel , ” the witness claimed ",0
The eyewitness then goes on to directly say that he and his wife were involved in an active shooter situation at a different hotel that authorities have so far done everything in their power to cover - up ,0
“ My wife and I were in Las Vegas celebrating our 10th anniversary and on October 1st we were involved in an incident with an active shooter at the Bellagio ,0
"There is no mistake in my mind about it , ” he continued ",0
Jeff then describes a scene in which he and his wife were walking through the main lobby when screams and gunfire erupted ,0
"Keep in mind , this is all information that the police and the FBI has hidden from the American people ",1
"“ All of a sudden there was just a crescendo of screams that started behind us in the lobby , ” he claimed ",0
“ Then I heard somebody yell ‘ there ’s a shooter ! ,0
"There ’s a shooter!’ And then I heard like five or six pops , like unmistakable gunfire , unmistakably ",0
” ,0
“ That was about 11:20 when we heard the shots and the screams … at that point you could hear and see the screams and see hundreds of people coming towards us ,0
” ,0
"Amazingly , as Shepard Ambellas noted , “ The man ’s claims match up to actual events captured in police audio recordings from the night of the shooting which confirms that between 11:15 and 11:18 p.m. on the night of Oct. 1 there was , in fact , something going on at the Bellagio ",0
” ,0
"This testimony also backs up claims by another eyewitness , Rene Downs , who has spent the past few days doing interviews about a shooter inside the Bellagio Hotel ",0
Slowly but surely we are starting to see the official narrative regarding the Las Vegas Massacre be completely destroyed ,1
At this point it is strikingly obvious that authorities have lied to the American people about the worst mass shooting in our countries history ,1
One can only speculate as to what the reasons for these lies actually are ? ,1
PressTV - Sun to cool down in next 30 years : Study ,0
"Scientists say our Sun will likely enter a cooldown cycle as soon as 2050 , but the phase has almost no effect on global warming ",0
Physicist Dan Lubin at the University of California San Diego and two of his colleges managed to collect and observe relevant data for the past 20 years and came to the conclusion that the giant burning ball of gas in our planetary system might enter a “ grand minimum ” period of decreased ultraviolet radiation that would last for some 11 years by mid - century ,0
"“ The cooldown … [ is ] a periodic event during which the Sun ’s magnetism diminishes , sunspots form infrequently , and less ultraviolet radiation ( UV ) makes it to the surface of the planet , ” researchers noted in a statement earlier this week , adding that “ the event is triggered at irregular intervals by random fluctuations related to the Sun ’s magnetic field ",0
” ,0
"The study , whose results were published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters , said the Sun is likely to be 6.9 percent cooler than its usual lowest amount of activity in the grand minimum ",0
"According to the researchers , the cooldown phase could echo those experienced in Europe in the mid-17th century , called the “ Maunder Minimum , ” or the prolonged sunspot minimum , during which temperatures were low enough to cause London 's River Thames to freeze over on a regular basis and to freeze the Baltic Sea to such an extent that Swedish troops were able to invade Denmark in 1658 on foot by marching across the sea ice ",0
"However , scientists warned that it should not be assumed that the ultra - cooling of the sun would potentially prevent the negative effects of global warming ",0
"“ The cooling effect of a grand minimum is only a fraction of the warming effect caused by the increasing concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , ” they said , adding , “ After hundreds of thousands of years of CO2 levels never exceeding 300 parts per million in air , the concentration of the greenhouse gas is now over 400 parts per million , continuing a rise that began with the Industrial Revolution ",0
” ,0
The study estimated that the Sun ’s mid - century cooldown would probably only result in cooling the Earth by some 0.25 percent between 2020 and 2070 ,0
"As a result , the temperature at the surface of our cosmic home would decrease by up to several tenths of a degree Celsius , which is not sufficient to stop global warming , but it could at least soften its effects in part ",0
“ Now we have a benchmark from which we can perform better climate model simulations ,0
"We can therefore have a better idea of how changes in solar UV radiation affect climate change , ” said Lubin ",0
The Sun Is Going DARK : No Sunspots For 96 Days ; Ice Age Approaches ,0
NASA ’s own data is showing that the star our globe revolves around is dimming ,0
"With no sunspots reported in 96 days , the sun is going dark and the evidence could point to an approaching ice age ",0
"As the sun gets successively more blank with each day , due to lack of sunspots , it is also dimming , says the website Watts Up With That ? ",0
"According to data from NASA ’s Spaceweather , so far in 2017 , 96 days ( 27 % ) of the days observing the sun have been without sunspots ",0
"Today at Cape Canaveral , SpaceXlaunched a new sensor to the International Space Station named TSIS-1 ",0
Its mission : to measure the dimming of the sun ’s irradiance ,0
It will replace the aging SORCE spacecraft ,0
"NASA SDO reports that as the sunspot cycle plunges toward its 11-year minimum , NASA satellites are tracking a decline in total solar irradiance ( TSI ) ",0
–Watts Up With That ? ,0
The Daily Sheeple ’s Joe Joseph breaks it down for those who do n’t closely follow the sun ’s changes ,0
"He says there is a correlation between major changes on the sun and the behavior of the Earth , especially now as it reaches its 11-year - cycle ’s solar minimum ",0
"“ I guess you could say , in a very generalistic sense … and I mean , this is as vanilla as you can possibly make it … that as the sun gets quieter so does our magnetic field get weaker or so it appears to be , ” says Joseph ",0
“ Is there a mini ice age coming ? ,0
"I do n’t know , ” he said ",0
But other sources say it ’s more than possible that we will see a mini ice age in the next three years due to the dimming of our sun ,0
"A 15-YEAR long mini ice age could be due to hit the Northern hemisphere in just four years as the sun prepares for “ hibernation ” – triggering a barrage of cataclysmic events , says The Express UK in 2016 ",0
"Solar activity , measured by the appearance of sun spots , has been declining at a greater rate than at any other time in history ",0
And that could have widespread implications ,0
"A team of experts have warned that huge seismic events , including volcanic eruptions , plunging global temperatures and destabilization of the Earth ’s crust will become more common after worrying changes to the surface of the Sun were recorded ",1
Research by the The Space and Science Research Center in Florida revealed a strong link between low solar activity and seismic events ,0
Scientists say that it could take up to 15 years for solar activity to return to normal with extreme weather and freezing temperatures continuing until 2035 ,0
This warning will infuriate environmental campaigners who argue by 2030 the world faces increased sea levels and flooding due to glacial melt at the poles and a warming of the globe ,1
Vote targeting Jewish student politician was not anti - Semitic : McGill report ,0
"MONTREAL – It was political disagreement — not anti - Semitism — that led to a Jewish student being voted off the McGill University student council ’s board of directors , an investigation ordered by the principal has concluded ",0
"But Jewish groups on and off campus have denounced the report as flawed , saying it missed the significance of an anti - Semitic text circulated online before Noah Lew was removed from the board last fall ",1
"A joint statement from five campus Jewish groups says the report , released this week by principal Suzanne Fortier , “ appears to condone discrimination against Jewish students at McGill based on the cultural and religious organizations they affiliate with ",0
” ,0
"The controversy has its roots in McGill ’s long - running debate over the anti - Israel Boycott , Divestment and Sanctions movement ",0
"At an Oct. 23 general assembly of the Student Society of McGill University , a routine motion to elect a slate of directors turned contentious ",0
"Supporters of a group called Democratize SSMU , formed to fight a decision of the board of directors declaring BDS counter to the SSMU constitution , brought a motion to divide the election vote ",0
In the past they had been ratified as a bloc ,0
"The first five candidates were overwhelmingly approved , but when they got to Lew , the only Jewish director , he was rejected 105 to 73 ",1
"In a subsequent Facebook post , Lew wrote , “ My Jewish identity was now public , and a target was placed squarely upon me by the McGill BDS movement ",1
” ,0
"An outcry followed , leading Fortier to appoint former Ombudsperson for Students , Spencer Boudreau , to investigate ",1
She also created a Task Force on Respect and Inclusion in Campus Life and a support line to report incidents of intolerance ,0
Boudreau interviewed 38 students over his three - and - a - half week investigation ,0
"His findings , he wrote , do “ not substantiate the notion that the vote was motivated by anti - Semitism , ” which he defined as hostility toward or discrimination against Jews ",0
"Rather , he found , votes against Lew were “ motivated by politics , that is , based on his support for Israel and Zionism and/or for his view of the BDS movement ",0
"” Protests about Israel ’s policies can not be equated with anti - Semitism , Boudreau wrote , though he said Lew ’s belief that he was targeted because he was Jewish was “ honest and even understandable ",0
” ,0
"A statement Wednesday by Hillel McGill , Chabad at McGill and three other Jewish groups said Boudreau was mistaken about the timing of an anti - Semitic message posted online by Democratize SSMU ",0
"Boudreau ’s report said the message followed the assembly vote , but in fact it was posted at the beginning of October ",0
"Democratize SSMU deleted the message , which targeted Lew and two other candidates , after the meeting and apologized for publishing material that was “ insensitive to anti - Semitic tropes of Jewish people as corrupt and politically powerful ",1
” ,0
The Jewish groups said this anti - Semitic rhetoric “ was used to encourage students to vote specifically against Noah Lew ,1
"It is under this context that the ( general assembly ) occurred , and the report fundamentally misunderstands this , which alters the entire findings of the report ",1
” ,0
They say Boudreau ’s report “ insinuates that Jewish students who engage with mainstream Jewish community organizations are permitted to be precluded from holding political office ,0
” ,0
Lew was restored to his post as a director last month after a ruling that the split vote in October had violated the SSMU constitution ,0
He was not immediately available for comment ,0
"Michael Mostyn , CEO of B’nai Brith Canada , called the report a whitewash ",1
"“ The report does not present a full or accurate picture of the hostile atmosphere facing Jewish students at McGill , ” he said in a statement ",0
"Fortier said the university ’s next actions will be based on the recommendations of the Task Force on Respect and Inclusion in Campus Life , due to report in April ",0
"“ I would like to take this opportunity to make it clear that there is absolutely no place for anti - Semitism at McGill University and that , as principal and vice - chancellor , I will remain vigilant to ensure that all members of our community feel safe , welcomed and respected on our campuses , ” she said in a statement ",1

Dem Congressman Corrects ADL 's Claim That He Is n't Into Farrakhan ,0
The media has maintained a tight embargo on the release of the photo of Obama meeting with Nation of Islam hate group leader Louis Farrakhan at a Congressional Black Caucus meeting ,0
Almost no national media outlet has covered the story ,0
CNN only mentioned it when it embedded Jake Tapper 's tweets about the support for Farrakhan by Women 's March leaders ,0
But Rep. Danny Davis had defended Farrakhan ,0
Democratic Illinois Rep. Danny Davis defended Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan as an “ outstanding human being ” on Monday ,0
"Farrakhan ’s history of racially extreme comments includes blaming Jews for the September 11 attacks , saying white people “ deserve to die ” and praising Adolf Hitler as a “ very great man ",0
"” “ I personally know [ Farrakhan ] , I ’ve been to his home , done meetings , participated in events with him , ” Davis told TheDC ",0
The JTA 's awkward attempt to whitewash the newly revealed CBC anti - Semitism included a claim from the ADL that Rep. Davis had been misquoted ,1
"An ADL official told JTA on Friday that the group had reached out to Rep. Danny Davis , a Democrat , after an article in The Daily Caller said he lauded Farrakhan on Monday as “ an outstanding human being ",0
"” Farrakhan has calledJews “ the enemy of God and the enemy of the righteous , ” and said Jews were responsible for the 9/11 terror attacks and the rise of the Ku Klux Klan in the 20th century ",1
"“ The congressman was insistent that The Daily Caller misquoted him during the interview and that he did n’t subscribe to Farrakhan ’s anti - Semitic statements and actions in the past , ” the ADL official told JTA in a statement ",1
"“ He expressed an interest in seeing some of the latest statements made by Farrakhan vis - a - vis Jews , which we promptly shared with him ",0
"” The official said the ADL had shared information with Davis about Farrakhan ’s anti - Semitic statements , and that the organization was waiting to hear back from him ",0
"Now , Rep. Davis would really like to emphasize that the ADL is wrong and he loves Farrakhan ",1
"Democratic Illinois Rep. Danny Davis confirmed in an interview Sunday that he has a personal relationship with Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan , a notorious anti - Semite , and said he is n’t bothered by Farrakhan ’s position on “ the Jewish question ",0
"” Farrakhan has repeatedly denounced Jews as “ satanic , ” praised Hitler as a “ very great man ” and has said that white people “ deserve to die ",1
"” The congressman was n’t sure why the ADL wrote that he had been misquoted in his praise for the anti - Semite , and said he was n’t sure if someone from his office had told the ADL he was misquoted , he told The Daily Caller News Foundation on Sunday ",0
“ I think that was what they wanted to write ,0
"Nah , I do n’t have no problems with Farrakhan , I do n’t spend a whole lot of my time dealing with those kind of things , ” Davis said ",0
“ That ’s just one segment of what goes on in our world ,0
The world is so much bigger than Farrakhan and the Jewish question and his position on that and so forth ,1
"For those heavy into it , that ’s their thing , but it ai n’t my thing , ” he said ",0
"The people who talk about the """""""" Jewish question """""""" are generally anti - Semites ",1
Somehow I do n't think a white congressman would get away with saying that he agrees with David Duke on the environment but is n't especially concerned about his racism ,0
But black leaders have gotten away with playing that game with Farrakhan repeatedly ,0
But the ADL and the JTA will whitewash this again ,1
"And if they ca n't whitewash this , they 'll ignore it ",1
Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders ,0
The Francis Vatican ’s approach to the contemplative life is probably the most illustrative of our entire crisis ,0
Contemplative life is aimed only at a purely supernatural end ,0
It has no “ use ” in the sense that either the Bergoglians – in terms of their political machinations – or the world can understand ,0
There is probably no other place where the differences between the two programmes - the Catholic programme of Christ and the Bergoglian / Kasperian programme - are more sharply contrasted ,0
One aspect of Pope Francis’ character that seems little - explored by the Catholic and secular media alike is his apparent disdain for contemplative religious life – a facet of Catholic life that could be described as the most purely religious of all the Church ’s undertakings ,0
The world does not understand it or want it ,0
"Therefore , it is something of a thorn in the Bergoglian side , and he has repeatedly expressed his contempt for it ",0
"So when , in 2016 he issued a document on contemplative nuns , the faithful braced for impact ",0
"In his recent document , ostensibly on holiness , “ Gaudete et Exultate , ” the pope attacked the religious desire for silence and solitude , to be alone with God in prayer , seeking unity with Him , saying in essence that the Christian life is inherently about social activism , about material , worldly ends ",1
"To these foundations of the contemplative life – indeed of any form of religious life in the Church – Francis set up another of his false dichotomies , contemplation in opposition to serving others , giving a Jesuit maxim as an imperative for all Catholics : “ We are called to be contemplatives even in the midst of action , and to grow in holiness by responsibly and generously carrying out our proper mission ",1
” ,0
"Italian Vaticanist Marco Tosatti commented dryly , “ Rejoice and be glad … but not if you ’re a cloistered contemplative ",0
” ,0
"In 2016 , I wrote that Francis’ Apostolic Constitution , “ Vultum dei quaerere ” was in some respects the most damaging object of the wrecking - ball pontificate to date ",1
"Unfortunately , it was about a subject that the world , and therefore the modern Church , cares so little about that hardly anyone noticed ",0
"Aimed specifically at female contemplative religious , the document threatened that in a year or so another would be forthcoming laying out precisely what would now be required of nuns to continue in their vocations ",0
"The new document issued last week , “ Cor orans , ” is juridical , that is , it is not much more than a list of specific norms , or rules – 289 of them ! ",0
– that all communities of contemplative nuns must now follow ,0
One odd remark in article 19 is maybe the most succinct description of the direction planned for contemplatives : ,0
"“ A monastery of nuns , as every religious house , is erected while keeping in mind its usefulness for the Church and for the Institute ",0
” ( emphasis added ) ,0
Wait … its “ usefulness ” ? ,0
"I think a fair question for the Faithful to ask this Vatican department might be , “ According to what specific criteria is a monastery ’s ‘ usefulness’ actually determined ? ” ",0
One ca n’t help but hearken back to the criteria for monasteries that were allowed to survive the revolutionary purges in 18th and 19th century Europe ,0
"A house that could prove to the secularists that it was “ useful ” – that it could care for the indigent elderly , teach children or nurse the sick – would be allowed to continue ",0
Those which were purely contemplative – a single - minded devotion to the adoration of God – were closed ,0
"It is not an insignificant quirk of modern history , and one that tells us much about the nature of the current pontificate , that houses of contemplatives are always attacked by secularist regimes , from Henry VIII to the Soviet Union ",1
Rupture ? ,0
What rupture ? ,0
The first thing Cor orans does is claim continuity with both pre and post - Vatican II theology ,0
"In the Introduction , it seems anxious to establish a “ hermeneutic of continuity ” with Pius XII and his document Sponsa Christi Ecclesia of 1950 ",0
"The authors insist there is no contradiction between the two – except , of course , where there are contradictions – and that both Pius XII and Francis are keen to see nuns reaching the “ aim of their specific vocation ",0
” It describes Francis as promulgating this document “ in the wake ” of Pius XII[1 ] ,0
"In fact , Pope Francis , by promulgating the Apostolic Constitution Vultum Dei quaerere , on June 29 , 2016 , to help the contemplatives reach the aim of their specific vocation , invited reflection and discernment on the precise content tied to consecrated life in general and to the monastic tradition in particular , but he did not intend to abrogate Sponsa Christi Ecclesia that was derogated only in some points ",0
"As a consequence , the two pontifical documents are to be held as normative in force for monasteries of nuns and must be read in a unitary vision ",0
"But of course , the entire game is given away in the next paragraph : ",0
"Pope Francis , in the wake of the teaching of Pope Pius XII and reaffirmed by Ecumenical Vatican Council II , intended to present in Vultum Dei quaerere the intense and fruitful path taken by the Church in the last decades , in the light of the teachings of the same Council and considering the changed socio - cultural conditions ",1
"Yes , that ’s what it said ",0
Here ’s my translation : ,1
“ The Church ’s ‘ path’ of the last 50 years has been ‘ fruitful’ ,1
How do you know ? ,0
Because we ’re telling you it has ,0
” ,0
"In other words , there have been absolutely no problems whatever with the direction taken either by the Church or by the religious life since Vatican II ",1
Everything that has happened has been in complete and perfect continuity between the Before Church and the After Church ; there has been no rupture or break with the past ,1
"All changes undertaken by religious houses were perfectly legitimate and good - “ fruitful ” if , perhaps , a bit “ intense ” – and have been made in “ light of the teachings ” of Vatican II and “ changed socio - cultural conditions ",1
"” There is , therefore , no legitimate reason whatever for any religious house to attempt to “ turn back the clock ” to the pre - Vatican II norms or styles of religious life ",0
Anyone attempting to do this are Bad Nuns [ insert string of incomprehensible papal insults here ,1
] ,0
This is what might be considered the guiding principle of the document ; “ Nothing to see here ,0
"And if you say there is , you ’re the problem ",0
” ,0
"Of course , this kind of bold proclamation is very much in keeping with the habit of this pontificate to simply claim there are no problems and become gravely offended and outraged when the contrary is pointed out ",1
"It ’s your fault if you find contradictions , not theirs ; they ’ve said there are no contradictions , therefore there are n’t any ",0
"After all , this is the papacy where 2 + 2 = 5 if the pope says it does ",0
"The irony , of course , is built in , since this document is intended as a legal chopping block for the dissolution of any house of contemplative nuns that is judged to be hovering on the edge of extinction or is for some other reason in need of the chop ",1
Why would the Vatican need a document giving extensive norms for the closure of monasteries that have too few nuns or do not follow their originally intended charisms if everything about the religious life since Vatican II has been hunky dory ? ,0
Let ’s remember that this comes from the Congregation for Religious of Braz de’Aviz and Jose Rodriguez Carballo ,0
"This is the Cardinal Braz de’Aviz[2 ] who wasted no time in orienting himself in the New Paradigm when , close on the heels of the Conclave he slammed the attempt by his predecessor – and by extension Pope Benedict – to reign in the notorious Leadership Conference of Women Religious in the US ",0
"He complained that he had been shut out of the process under Cardinal Rode , and later made a large and public point of appeasing and mollifying the most outspokenly heretical and politicised organisation of female religious in the world ",1
Apparently the total statistical collapse of the religious life following Vatican II[3 ] had nothing to do with the massive systemic changes to the forms of that life – always claimed to be “ mandated ” by “ the Council ” ,0
And of course we are talking about the priorities of a pope who has said that seeing a “ restorationist ” community enjoying a large number of vocations makes him “ worry ,0
” Apparently this worry was serious enough to move him to torpedo one of the most flourishing communities in the modern Church ; the gaunt spectre of the Franciscan Friars and Sisters of the Immaculate haunts this document ,1
Autonomy vs. ,1
Independence ,0
One of the talking points the media have latched onto is the whole business of “ autonomy ” of monasteries ,1
"Many of the headlines crowed : “ Vatican confirms nuns’ autonomy , ” or similar ",1
But that word does not mean what they think it means ,0
"In fact , the word “ autonomy ” is the key to understanding this whole thing ",1
It appears in the document 16 times and “ autonomous ” 30 times ,1
"In fact , “ autonomy ” is held up as the single most important criterion for determining a monastery ’s viability ",1
This emphasis is repeated so often one might almost think there is a concern in Rome that the “ fruitful ” post - conciliar monastic life is in danger of fizzling out … for … some reason … ,1
"Monastery sui juris refers to the religious house of a female monastic community that , having the requisites for real autonomy of life , was legitimately erected by the Holy See and enjoys juridical autonomy under the law ",1
"18 In order to obtain juridical autonomy for a monastery of nuns , it must presuppose a real autonomy of life , that is , the ability to manage the life of the monastery in all its dimensions ( vocational , formative , governmental , relational , liturgical , economic ... ) ",1
"In this case , an autonomous monastery is alive and vital ",1
"43 Autonomy of life , a constant prerequisite for maintaining juridical autonomy , must be constantly verified by the Federal President who , when in her judgment a monastery lacks autonomy of life , must inform the Holy See in view of the nomination of an ad hoc commission ",1
"67 Affiliation [ with another monastery , appointed by the Vatican ] can be an opportunity for recovery and rebirth when autonomy of life is partially compromised ",1
"If the situation of incapacity is irreversible , the solution , as painful as it is necessary , is the suppression of the monastery ",0
"no longer possesses a real autonomy of life , it is the responsibility of the Federation President to report the matter to the Holy See ",1
"When an autonomous monastery , it is the responsibility ofto the Holy See ",0
"At the same time , this document is redefining the term “ autonomous ” to exclude independence ",1
What got no mention in the brief press interest was the document ’s insistence that all monasteries of nuns must belong to a federation and while monasteries must demonstrate “ autonomy ” they will be granted little in the way of powers of self - governance ,1
"As we will see , the federations are now a multilayered system of internal surveillance and centralised control that leaves Orwell in the dust : ",0
overcome isolation and promote regular observance and contemplative life ,0
"Federation of monasteries means a structure of communion among some autonomous monasteries of the same Institute [ 4 ] , erected by the Holy See that approves the Statutes , so that in sharing the same charism , the federated monasteriesand promote regular observance and contemplative life ",0
Note the change : “ independent ” is replaced with “ isolated[5 ] ,0
” It reminds me of a conversation I had with a superior of a Benedictine house in the UK ,0
"She said she thought that the psychiatric testing , that in 2008 was still all the rage among the houses of her monastery ’s federation , was excessive and not helpful ",0
"She did n’t trust the heavily secularised field of psychology to help in determining a candidate ’s suitability for religious life , so she did n’t require these tests of her monastery ’s postulants ",0
"She also said that she was under constant pressure , both the subtle pressure of general peer disapproval and overt requests to conform by the federation ’s leadership ",0
Was that monastery “ isolated ” ? ,0
Or just exercising lawful self - governance ? ,0
"And given that autonomy is being held up as the sole criterion for viability of a monastery , it seems the Holy See is not interested in asking whether it is actually faithful to the charism , or even to the Catholic Faith , a question that has burned brightly for serious Catholics for some time ",1
"The word “ fidelity ” appears in the document four times , which may give an idea of how much interest the Vatican has in this issue ",0
Funny you should mention autonomy : Bioethics and the dissolution of “ unviable ” monasteries ,1
It ’s funny that the buzzword of the day in Rome should be “ autonomy ” ,1
"As we shall see , the document is what I ’ve called above a “ chopping block ” ",0
"Vultum dei quaerere made it clear that this juridical document would provide a set of legal criteria by which a monastery can be considered viable , religious life worthy of life , so to speak , and that those considered to have failed the test would be closed ",0
Note the language used here : ,0
"If the situation of incapacity is irreversible , the solution , as painful as it is necessary , is the suppression of the monastery ",0
It jogged a memory for me ,0
“ Incapacity ” … Where had I heard that language used before ? ,0
Most pro - life observers in Britain will tell you that it was the “ Mental Capacity Act ” of 2005 that established in British law the concept that a person with permanently “ reduced capacity ” could be legally starved and/or dehydrated to death by doctors ,0
"This is the world , the language , of Bioethics , applied utilitarianism , also called “ Principlism ” after its three bioethical criteria of “ justice , beneficence[6 ] and autonomy ” – it is a patient ’s ability to demonstrate his “ autonomy ” or “ quality of life,[7 ] ” either currently or potentially , that decides his fate ",1
"This set of criteria is being applied in medical institutions across the western world now , a “ new paradigm ” of ethics replacing traditional “ Hippocratic ” or “ Natural Law ” medical ethics ",0
"Under this system the onus , effectively , is on the patient to prove according to the new criteria that he is worthy of receiving medical treatment – of continuing to live ",0
Medical treatment ( which legally includes food and water ) can be withdrawn from patients who fail to demonstrate that they will recover sufficiently to return to an autonomous lifestyle ,1
Health care systems like that of the UK have government regulatory boards giving out “ guidelines ” to determine in a uniform way how health care resources are allocated ,0
These guidelines are collated by professional Bioethicists applying their utilitarian criteria ,0
"If the equation does n’t come out in the patient ’s favour , the “ treatment ” recommended for the patient ’s “ best interests ” will include his demise , often procured by withdrawing nutrition and hydration and/or administering slowly lethal doses of sedatives ",0
"The NHS in the UK has actually gone to court , and won , declaring that they must retain the right to kill patients who fail the Bioethics test ",0
The result has been a quiet reign of terror in which elderly and disabled people have started carrying cards stating in legalese that they do not want to be killed by their doctors ,1
In one case a man with ALS took the NHS to court in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to preemptively preclude his medical murder when his illness left him incapacitated ,0
"The system , in other words , is stacked against the patient , in favour of the government that holds all the cards ",0
Keep these facts in mind as we read through the rest of the document ,0
I think we can find an almost perfect analogy by replacing the term “ patient ” with “ monastery ,0
"” Think about how one would apply concepts like “ autonomy , ” “ viability , ” “ incapacity , ” “ quality of life ” and “ equitable distribution of scarce resources ” to this context ",1
"When the language of utilitarianism appears in Vatican documents as guiding criteria for the contemplative religious life , one has to wonder at what point has the entire project gone so disastrously off the rails ",1
Federations as Vatican watchdogs ,0
"Under this law , all monasteries of contemplative nuns must belong to a federation ",0
"Previously only voluntary and consultative , federations will now have the power to supervise and guide the formation of candidates , nuns and of their formators , as well as possess broad powers over temporal goods of individual monasteries and powers of suppression ",0
The document makes it inarguable that the federation ’s main role will be to establish and monitor for conformity to a particular programme – the “ intense and fruitful path ” of the Church since 1965 – both within the various orders and between them : ,1
The Federal Assembly : ,0
"deals with issues of major importance ; makes decisions and issues norms that all nuns are required to observe , after the definitive approval of the Holy See ; ",0
More than just federations ; a multi - tier system of control ,0
"Conference of monasteries means a structure of communion among autonomous monasteries , belonging to diverse Institutes and present in the same region ... in particular geographical or linguistic contexts ",1
"In other words , Benedictine federations of a given area will form a “ Conference ” with Carmelite federations and Dominican federations and Poor Clare federations , etc ",0
"This will be of interest to Carmelite houses especially , since they tend to be generally more on the “ conservative ” end of things ",0
"Imagine a house of traditional Carmelites attending regional Conference meetings – and attempting to keep up their Office schedule – with the balloons - and - guitars , break dancing Franciscans … What fun ! ",0
"And finally , just in case one entire federation decides to turn back the clock , there will be an umbrella for the umbrellas ; there will be watchers watching the watchers : ",0
"Confederation means a structure of connection among Federations of monasteries , erected by the Holy See that approves the Statutes , for the study of themes relative to contemplative life in relation to the same charism , to give unitary direction and a certain coordination to the activity of the individual Federations ",0
Broad powers ,0
"Federations will now have extremely broad powers both over money and property and , crucially , over formation of nuns ",0
"It is the Federation that now has the power to monitor for compliance with the rules , to report non - compliance to the Holy See , to make new foundations and , apparently , to “ encourage ” individual monasteries to “ communicate ” their goods ",0
"The legitimately established Federation is a public juridic person in the Church and is therefore able to acquire , possess , administer , and alienate temporal , movable and immovable goods , which are ecclesiastical assets , in accordance with the universal and proper law ",0
"To keep alive and strengthen the union of monasteries , implementing one of the aims of the Federation , a certain communication of goods is encouraged among the monasteries , coordinated by the Federal President ",0
"The communication of goods in a Federation is implemented through contributions , gifts , loans that monasteries offer other monasteries that have financial difficulties , and for the common needs of the Federation ",0
The Federation considers the assets in its possession as necessary and useful means to achieve its goals ,0
Financial incentives ,0
"Given that we shall see below that the provisions for suppression of monasteries include vague and indefinable qualities like “ vitality in living and transmitting the charism ” and “ dynamic fidelity ” to the order ’s charism , and that the goods of extinct monasteries will be assumed by the federation , one might be forgiven for asking if this creates an incentive to see to it that certain houses go extinct[8 ] ",0
"Since the document provides several mechanisms by which a federation can move nuns out of a monastery , this could be one of those indelicate questions some superiors might want to keep in mind ",0
Article 94 requires that once it is canonically erected the federation is to seek “ legal recognition also in the civil sphere ,0
"” This , presumably , will bear upon legal disputes in civil courts over the property of suppressed monasteries ",0
"Article 73 , on the disposition of the material assets of a monastery that has gone completely extinct : ",0
"In the event of the suppression of a totally extinct monastery , when there are no surviving nuns , unless otherwise provided by the Holy See , the destination of the suppressed monastery 's assets , in compliance with canon and civil law , go to the respective higher juridical person , that is , to the Federation of monasteries or to another structure of communion among the monasteries equal to it or to the female monastic Congregation ",0
"The economic fund [ of the federation ] is nourished by the free donations of the monasteries , by the donations of benefactors , and by revenues deriving from the alienation of the assets of suppressed monasteries , as established by the present Instruction ",0
Federations in charge of formation ,0
"The Federation President , in particular , watches over initial and ongoing formation in the monasteries to see if it is in conformity with the charism proper to the Institute , so that every community may be a beacon that illumines the journey of the men and women of our time ",0
"At the end of the visit , she will inform the Holy See about the real possibilities that the monastery has or does not have of guaranteeing initial formation ",0
"The formation of the formators and their collaborators is entrusted in part to the monasteries and in part to the Federation , therefore , the President of the Federation is called to strengthen formation at the federal level and to require the participation of those who exercise the service of formation ; if this does not happen , she will refer the matter to the Holy See ",0
"The President of the Federation , having heard the opinion of the Federal Council , chooses the most appropriate places to hold the specific formative courses for the formators and their collaborators , as well as those who are called to exercise the service of authority , establishing the duration of these courses in such a way that they are not detrimental to the needs of the contemplative life and of the community ",0
Who makes new foundations and why ? ,0
"Throughout the history of the Church , it has been the prerogative of bishops to establish houses of contemplatives in their own dioceses ",0
"Now , with the pope having forbidden bishops to exercise this ancient right , according to this document , the federations themselves can make foundations ",0
"through the action of the Federation , as established by the Federal Assembly The foundation of a monastery of nuns , keeping in mind what is established in no ",0
"39 of the present Instruction , can take place either by a single monastery or , as established by the Federal Assembly [ 9 ] ",0
"A single monastic community that decides to make a foundation , moreover , must be “ helped ” and guided by the federation : ",0
"In discerning the foundation of a new monastery on the part of a single monastery , the Federal President and the religious Assistant intervene to help the Superior of the founding monastery ",0
The discernment on the foundation of a new monastery by the Federation is made within the framework of the Federal Assembly ,0
Article 39 tells us some criteria for making foundations that “ must be considered in their entirety and from an overall perspective ,0
” ,0
"the necessary vitality in living and transmitting the charism , ” composed of at least eight nuns of solemn vows , “ as long as most are not of advanced age ” ",0
"a ) A community that has given good testimony of fraternal life in common with “ ” composed of at least eight nuns of solemn vows , “ as long as most are not of advanced age ” ",0
"b ) Besides the number , special skills are required of some nuns of the community who must be able to assume : as Superior , the service of authority ; as formator , the initial formation of candidates ; as financial administrator , the administration of the goods of the monastery ",0
"c ) Rooms adapted to the lifestyle of the community , to ensure that the nuns can regularly lead the contemplative life according to the nature and spirit of their Institute ",0
d ) Economic conditions that guarantee the community itself can provide for the needs of daily life ,0
One of these things is not like the others ,0
Did you notice ? ,0
"One criterion stands out as indeterminate , vague , compared with the other concrete and measurable standards ",0
One aspect of legislative analysis that I learned early was that the terms used are of utmost importance ,0
If a term is vague or is defined incorrectly that is a “ loophole ” ,0
Or it could perhaps be described as a handle ; a place where a person who wants to effect a particular outcome can grasp a piece of legislation to use it like an axe ,0
"So , how , exactly , is it to be determined – and by whom – that a group of nuns possess “ the necessary vitality in living and transmitting the charism ” ? ",0
"What , precisely , does the term “ vitality ” mean and exactly how is one to measure out how much is required ? ",0
"Is this one of Pope Francis little personal , secret expressions of which only he knows the meaning ? ",0
Like the secret to how nuns are to smile properly ? ,0
Does the inclusion of completely subjective criteria belong in a juridical document ? ,0
Or is it in there in order to provide cover for prelates ? ,0
"The next article tells us , “ It is the responsibility of the Holy See to evaluate the presence of these requisites ",0
” Do they have an electronic meter in a cupboard in the Congregation for Religious that measures “ charism vitality ” ? ,0
"It seems important to ask because article 70 , on how to suppress a monastery , includes it : ",0
"Among the criteria that can contribute to determine a judgment concerning the suppression of a monastery , after having examined all the circumstances , the following points should be considered as a whole : the number of nuns , the advanced age of the majority of the members , the real capacity for government and formation , lack of candidates for a number of years , lack of the necessary vitality in living and transmitting the charism in dynamic fidelity[10 ] ",0
You will be affiliated ; resistance is futile … ,0
"It seems there are two themes running through the document : to establish a certain value of “ autonomy ” as the indispensable criterion for viability , while at the same time asserting top - down oversight and control over who gets to make this determination ",1
"In short , a monastery must be autonomous , but heaven help the community that asserts its independence ",1
Articles 54 - 64 offer an interim measure in the case of “ incapacity ” that is really just more of the second thing ,0
Once a lack of autonomy has been established … ,1
"54 Affiliation is a particular form of help that the Holy See establishes in particular situations in favor of the community of a monastery sui juris which has only an asserted autonomy , but in reality , very precarious or , in fact , non - existent ",0
"55 Affiliation is configured as a juridical support that must assess whether the inability to manage the life of the autonomous monastery in all its dimensions is only temporary or is irreversible , helping the community of the affiliated monastery to overcome difficulties or to put in place what is necessary to bring about the suppression of this monastery ",1
How does affiliation work ? ,0
"Well , the federation and the Holy See between them work it out : ",0
"In these cases , it is up to the Holy See to evaluate the opportunity of setting up an ad hoc commission formed by the Ordinary , the Federation President , the Federal Assistant , and the Major Superior of the monastery ",0
It ’s starting to be clear that the federation is going to be little more than the Big Brother hit - squad of the Congregation for Religious ,1
It ’s worth remembering what happened in the case of a German men ’s monastery in which the superior tried to return the community to pre - Vatican II practices ,0
"Mariawald Trappist monastery – 900 years old – was finally dissolved , affiliated to death ",0
"Its superior had made the fatal error of openly declaring – in 2008 , after the publication of Summorum Pontificum – that the monastery ’s problems all began when it adopted the new liturgical rites and implemented the trends of all religious after Vatican II , and that clearly the solution was to go back to pre - conciliar ways ",1
"Mariawald was consequently affiliated , in the manner this document describes , with a liberal house in the Netherlands whose superior , unsurprisingly , discovered that the house was hopelessly divided and could not be saved ",0
What would make forced affiliation a truly devastating weapon against conservative or traditional communities is the proviso that an affiliated monastery may not form its own novices : ,1
"60 The affiliated monastery can accept candidates , but the novitiate and initial formation must be performed in the affiliating monastery or in another monastery established by the Federation ",0
” ,0
"Of course , this means it is the affiliating monastery ’s formation team that would make the determination to dismiss recalcitrant , “ neo - pelagian ” postulants and novices ",0
~ ,0
This brings us to about article 155 of the document ,0
Part two to come ,0
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ,0
"[ 1 ] It would seem , therefore , that a useful task for someone writing about what this pope intends for nuns would be to read Sponsa Christi Ecclesia as well as Francis’ Apostolic Constitution and make a careful comparison ",0
"I ’m not going to do that here , but it might be helpful to examine the two documents with the help of a expert at some point ",0
"[ 2 ] Worth remembering , however , is the fact that it was Benedict the “ conservative , ” not Francis , who appointed Braz de’ Aviz in the office to replace Cardinal Rode – presumably under that good old “ conservative ” rubric of the “ big umbrella ” – under whom these culpably belated attempts to save US religious life were started ",0
[ 3 ] Just considering the numbers of course ,0
Leaving alone the doctrinal issues ,0
"[ 4 ] “ The same Institute ” means the order in question , whether Benedictine , Dominican , Carmelite etc ",0
"[ 5 ] I ’d love to hear from some monastic superior who had the nerve to tell Rome , “ Actually , given that all our neighbours in religion are raging neo - modernist heretics , if not schismatics , we think ‘ isolation’ is a desirable thing – like quarantine during an outbreak of Bubonic Plague – and would therefore like to be dispensed from the federation requirement ",0
” I ’d pay good money to see the shade of purple the well - fed Braz de’Aviz turned ,1
"[ 6 ] “ justice and beneficence ” are considered on behalf of the community , not the patient ",0
[ 7 ] Bioethicists take it as read that in order for a life to have sufficient “ quality ” it must demonstrate sufficient autonomy ,0
"Dependence upon the care of others is , quite literally , a capital offence ",1
"[ 8 ] Readers may think I ’m exaggerating the danger of material motivations for suppressing monasteries , but as we will see , the distinction between the federations and the Holy See is also a matter of paperwork and it is well to recall that the secretary for the Congregation for Religious , Jose Rodrigues Carballo , was a person of interest to international police agencies for the loss of “ tens of millions ” of Euros from the coffers of the Franciscan Friars Minor , the original Franciscan order of which he had been the head ",0
"Shortly after Carballo ’s appointment , it was revealed that the Swiss prosecutor ’s office was investigating the money missing from the Friars Minor in connection with drugs , money laundering operations and gun running ",0
"Carballo was Francis’ very first appointment , April 6 , 2013 , three weeks after the Conclave and it was to him that the pope gave the task of the destruction of the FFIs , and a major part of that operation was to separate the FFIs from real assets valued at about 30 million Euros ",0
[ 9 ] So much for the principle of subsidiarity ,0
I can imagine what a monastery founded by a committee would be like to live in ,0
[ 10 ] We ’ll pass over “ dynamic fidelity ” in silence for now … ,1

Trump Threatens To Send Military To Block Honduran Migrant Caravan ,0
This is the second time a caravan of migrants have gotten together and seem intent on pushing towards and across the US / Mexico border ,0
"As a result of the news , President Donald Trump has threatened to send the military to the border to block them ",0
Reuters reports on the caravan ,0
"More Honduran migrants tried to join a caravan of several thousand trekking through Guatemala on Wednesday , defying calls by authorities not to make the journey after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to cut off regional aid in reprisal ",0
The caravan has been growing steadily since it left the violent Honduran city of San Pedro Sula on Saturday ,1
"The migrants hope to reach Mexico and then cross its northern border with the United States , to seek refuge from endemic violence and poverty in Central America ",1
"Several thousand people are now part of the caravan , according to a Reuters witness traveling with the group in Guatemala , where men women and children on foot and riding in trucks filled a road on their long journey to Mexico ",0

They are unconstitutional and neither Congress nor you have the authority to give American 's money to these countries ,1

EXPERIMENTAL Ebola Vaccine Will Be Administered In Congo As Ebola Death Toll Climbs ,0
An experimental Ebola vaccine is being rolled out in Congo as the death toll from the infectious disease continues to climb ,1
The vaccination campaign will begin today ,0
"“ The vaccination campaign begins tomorrow , Monday , in Mbandaka , capital of the province , ” Minister of Health Oly Ilunga told The Associated Press as reported by 9 News Australia ",0
"“ It will target , first , the health staff , the contacts of the sick and the contacts of the contacts ",0
"” The World Health Organization has been warning about the “ Ebola situation ” in Congo , and it appears their only solution is an experimental vaccine ",1
An experimental vaccine is one that has never been tried on humans before ,0
"Ebola hemorrhagic fever , seen mostly only in Africa , is one of the world ’s most feared diseases ",0
"It begins with flu - like symptoms , followed by bloody diarrhea and vomiting ",0
"Days later , some victims begin bleeding through the nose , mouth , and eyes ",0
"Depending on the strain of the Ebola virus , it can kill up to 90 % of victims ",1
There is no cure for Ebola ,0
The virus is spread through direct contact with the blood or secretions of an infected person ,0
"So , is the Ebola virus reaching a terrifying enough level that an experimental vaccine is warranted ? ",1
"The death toll has reached 26 and the vaccine will be rolled out at Mbandaka , the north - western city of 1.2 million recently struck by the outbreak ",0
"Since the virus is spread through direct contact , an is n’t airborne , it is n’t nearly as deadly as it could be ",0
Read more here about Ebola and how it is transmitted : ,0
"Initially , the campaign will target 600 people , mainly medical staff , contacts of suspected cases , and those who have been in contact with the contacts , Ilunga said ",0
"Officials are working urgently to prevent the disease from spreading beyond Mbandaka , which lies on the Congo River , a busy traffic corridor , and is an hour ’s flight from the capital ",0
The spread of Ebola from a rural area to Mbandaka has raised alarm as Ebola can spread more quickly in urban centers ,1
The fever can cause severe internal bleeding that is often fatal ,0
"Meaning , the virus itself does n’t actually kill ",0
The immune system ’s response to the virus is what ’s deadly ,0
ZMapp is also an experimental drug that could aid in the recovery from the Ebola virus ,0
"But , like the vaccine being administered , it has not been tested for safety or efficacy yet ",0
It is not a vaccine – it is a therapeutic drug ,0
"Of the seven people given the drug so far , two have died ",0
"ZMapp show “ promise , ” although scientific results are not definitive ",0
"The risk of Ebola spreading within Congo is “ very high , ” according to authorities , and the disease could also move into nine neighboring countries , the World Health Organization has warned ",1
"The WHO , however , stopped short of declaring the outbreak a global health emergency ",0
WHO said there should not be restrictions on international travel or trade ,0
"In the meantime , it ’s important to prevent oneself from contracting the virus ",0
"Unfortunately , health care workers are at the greatest risk as they try to cull the suffering : which is why they will be the first to get the experimental vaccine ",0
"For their sake , let ’s hope it works better than this year ’s flu vaccine ",1

New Footage From Las Vegas Massacre Reveals Possible Muzzle Flashes From Helicopters That May Have Conducted “ Air Assault ” ,0
"Does this new footage reveal muzzle flashes from helicopters , an air assault , on the night of the massacre ? ",1
What appears to be muzzle flashes emitting from multiple aircraft can be seen on numerous videos captured on the night of the massacre ,0
LAS VEGAS ( INTELLIHUB ) — Newly released footage of the October 1 massacre posted on YouTube by the NICK VEGAS channel appears to confirm what Intellihub ’s founder and editor - in - chief Shepard Ambellas pointed out in late October when he presented evidence of the strategic air assault on The Alex Jones Show in great detail ,0
"The video shows what appears to be muzzle flashes emanating from the airspace between the Delano Hotel and Mandalay Bay , an airspace that should be free of obstruction altogether ",0
A major analysis of this matter was done by Ambellas in mid - November which revealed that no aircraft should be occupying that airspace between the hours of 10:05 and 10:15 p.m. on the night of the shooting ( i.e. ,0
no aircraft are visible on the radar in that airspace during that time ,0
) ,0
Not to mention the fact that helicopters are not allowed to hover in the City of Las Vegas without a permit nor are they allowed to lurk behind buildings lower than their roof lines ,0
"The first of a series of muzzles flashes can be seen coming from several different elevations , possibly from as many as 3 aircraft ( helicopters ) ",0
The flashes which are not consistent with FAA required running lights in any way can be seen starting at 0:19 seconds into the video ,0
Note : To see the flashes you must view the video on ‘ 1080p’ and set it to ‘ full screen’ and look between the two hotels ( adjust the video speed to 25 % ,0
) ,0
"The exact same aircraft and apparent muzzles flashes can also be seen in the Arch Angel Studios “ First Shots ” video which was posted to YouTube on Oct. 2 , just one day after the shooting ",0

Austrian bishop forcefully rejects German Bishops’ idea of blessing homosexual unions ,0
NewsCatholic Church ,0
"SALZBURG , Austria , February 13 , 2018 ( LifeSiteNews ) – The indignation about Cardinal Reinhard Marx and Bishop Franz - Josef Bode – the President and the Vice President of the German Bishops ' Conference – and their direct or more indirect encouragement of blessing homosexual unions is growing by the day ",0
Now Bishop emeritus Andreas Laun – one of the signatories of the Kazakh “ Profession of Truth about Sacramental Marriage ” – has written a strong commentary for the Austrian Catholic news website Kath.net on the recent episcopal initiatives coming out of Germany ,0
"In the following , we shall present to our readers the essential parts of Bishop Laun 's statement , in our English translation from the German ",0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ,0
"Dear Cardinal Marx and dear Bishop Bode , there is only one Catholic answer : No ! ",1
"And your addition “ in individual cases ” is absolutely worthless , it has no argumentative force ",1
A clear statement by Bishop Andreas Laun for Kath.net ,0
Cardinal Marx and also Bishop Bode have now opened up to the idea to offer homosexual couples a blessing ,0
"Why not , one could say , since the Church is ready to bless nearly everything on the earth ? ",1
"Now , the Church especially blesses people , but also deeds and objects ",0
The Jesuit Father Eckhard Bieger writes in the Internet about Catholic blessings : ,0
"For Catholics , really everything can be blessed , not only places of worship , chalices , and the faithful after each prayer service – whether after a Mass , or after the prayers for the hours of the day ",0
"The blessing is also not limited to rosaries or religious medal , but one may also bless cars , factory halls , animals , herbs , and much more ",0
"Some blessings are only to be made by priests and deacons , especially when it is about objects of worship such as chalices or vestments ",0
But parents can bless their children ,0
"The faithful may also take home holy water and sprinkle it on members of the family , but also the stable and the animals , thus blessing them ",0
[ ... ] ,0
What kind of hope is connected with a blessing ? ,0
"With regard to the car , certainly the wish for heavenly protection – sometimes also expressed with the help of a medal of St. Christopher , the patron saint of car drivers ",0
"With the weather blessing , one prays explicitly for protection against hail , lightning and drought ",0
"To bless always means that something shall flourish , because only then when there is a blessing upon a cause or a project , will something good come out of it ",1
"The blessing comes from God , He is being addressed in the form of a request ; and it is given to people , objects , and buildings , with the help of the sign of the cross , holy water , and incense ",0
"But now concerning the question of Cardinal Marx , and not a few of the priests , the answer is simple : one may ask for God 's blessing for sinners , but not for the sin ",0
"That is to say , one could not consecrate a brothel , one could not bless a concentration camp or weapons which are not explicitly ordained for hunting or for legitimate self - defense ",1
"Therefore it is clear that one may not bless a relationship which is sinful ; [ one may not bless ] the mafia ; no blessing for organizations or institutions which promote or procure abortions or which propagate ideologies which are against the Faith , antisemitic contents , or other forms of racist thought ",1
"If one considers and weighs this matter , one knows : one may not bless a union of two homosexual men or of lesbian women ",1
"Of course [ one could bless ] two men or women who are de facto homosexual , and that it what happens in each Holy Mass which is being attended by them ",0
"This blessing – which is not related to their acts – is being received also by all the other sinners , and the Church thereby hopes that they will convert under the influence of God 's Grace ! ",0
This position which is really simple and easily to be understood has been clearly and convincingly presented – since the statement of the two bishops [ Marx and Bode ] – by several Christians : by Archbishops Ludwig Schick ( Germany ) and Charles Chaput ( USA ) ; by the German - speaking theologians Hubert Windisch and Markus Büning ,1
"I am sure there are many many others , too , who think alike , but whom I do not know ",1
"Dear Cardinal Marx and dear Bishop Bode , there is only one Catholic answer : No ! ",1
"And your addition “ in individual cases ” is absolutely worthless , it has no argumentative force ",1
"What would St. John the Baptist have said if Herod , taking for himself his brother 's wife , would have excusingly called himself an “ individual case ” ! ",0
"The idea to bless sinful conduct is really what Isaiah described quite vividly , as follows : “ Woe to you that call evil good , and good evil : that put darkness for light , and light for darkness : that put bitter for sweet , and sweet for bitter ",0
” [ Isaiah 5:20 ] ,0
Is this not exactly what Cardinal Marx – and others who are thinking like him – are doing ? ,0
"If one were to place on a bottle of sour cucumbers a tag “ honey , ” the cucumbers still remain sour ! ",0
Even blessing bishops can not change that ,0
"Nor can the pope , in calling for a cultural revolution , especially since he does not explain what he exactly means by it ",0
"He says that he “ allows himself ” to talk like that – but if one dares something , one might win , but one also can perish ",1
That seems to catch on these days ,0
"For example , the Italian moral theologian , Maurizio Chiodi , recently claimed in his talk at the Gregorian Pontifical University that contraception is sometimes not only not forbidden , but even demanded ! ",0
"To contradict two popes – whom the Church has already “ beatified ” the one and “ canonized ” the other – so shortly after their deaths , and in such a radical and open manner , probably has never happened before in the Church 's history ",1
"Isaiah says that such people draw unto them God 's punishment , with thick cords ! ",1
"Nevertheless , one should wish for Cardinal Marx , Bishop Bode , and Professor Chiodi that they sleep well ",0
"Whether their conscience will allow it , is not so certain ; but if it does not [ allow it ] , it would certainly be a hope for their conversion ",0
"“ We Now Have Urban Ebola ” In Congo , WHO Warns Of “ Potentially Explosive Increase ” In Cases ",1
This report was originally published by Tyler Durden at Zero Hedge ,0
Experts fear an “ explosive increase ” in Ebola cases after an outbreak in Congo entered a “ new phase ” and spread from the countryside to a city ,1
"The BBC reports that Health Minister Oly Ilunga Kalenga confirmed a case in Mbandaka , a city of a million people about 130 km ( 80 miles ) from the area where the first cases were confirmed earlier this month ",0
The city is a major transportation hub with routes to the capital Kinshasa ,0
Forty - four people have been infected and 23 people are known to have died ,0
Senior World Health Organization ( WHO ) official Peter Salama said the spread to Mbandaka meant there was the potential for an “ explosive increase ” in cases ,1
"“ This is a major development in the outbreak , ” he told the BBC ",0
"“ We have urban Ebola , which is a very different animal from rural Ebola ",0
The potential for an explosive increase in cases is now there ,1
"” Mr Salama , the WHO ’s deputy director - general for emergency preparedness and response , said Mbandaka ’s location on the Congo river , widely used for transportation , raised the prospect of Ebola spreading to surrounding countries such as Congo - Brazzaville and the Central African Republic as well as downstream to Kinshasa , a city of 10 million people ",0
"“ This puts a whole different lens on this outbreak and gives us increased urgency to move very quickly into Mbandaka to stop this new first sign of transmission , ” he said ",0
"The BBC adds that the WHO said it was not recommending any trade or travel restrictions either within DR Congo , for example between Mbandaka and Kinshasa , or internationally ",0
But Mr Salama said that 13 countries in the region were boosting border screening measures and said DR Congo itself was increasing exit screening measures ,0
"“ The good news is that the DR Congo population is very used to Ebola outbreaks , ” he added ",0
“ They know to protect themselves by avoiding mass gatherings and mass funerals ,0
They know as well that traditional healers can amplify the outbreak ,0
” ,0
"As The Daily Mail notes , it is the ninth time Ebola has been recorded in Congo since the disease made its first known appearance near its northern Ebola river in the 1970s ",0
Ebola is most feared for the internal and external bleeding it can cause in victims owing to damage done to blood vessels ,0
"The Mail reports that health workers have recorded confirmed , probable and suspected cases of Ebola in three health zones of Congo ’s Equateur province , and have identified 432 people who may have had contact with the disease , the WHO said ",0
Supplies sent to Congo included more than 300 body bags for safe burials in affected communities ,0
"The vaccine will be reserved for people suspected of coming into contact with the disease , as well as health workers ",0
"The vaccine requires storage at a temperature between -60 and -80 degrees C , tricky in a country with unreliable electricity ",0
"FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE : Archbishop Lefebvre ’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant , 1976 ",0
"On that occasion Archbishop Lefebvre delivered an address on the desperate state of the Church at that time—42 years ago — that was never transcribed or published until we did so for the December 15 , 2017 print edition of The Remnant ",1
"It was held at the Radisson South Hotel , Minneapolis , on Tuesday , May 12 , 1976 , and its stated purpose was to assist the Archbishop in gaining a stronger foothold for the Society of St. Pius X in the States during the unprecedented crisis Blessed Pope Paul had helped unleash on the Church ",0
I ’m posting the address here because I 'm convinced the Archbishop ’s words provide recent recruits to Tradition with vital historical context for the diabolical debacle that is the pontificate of Pope Francis ,1
"And for those of us who ’ve been in the trenches for a long , long time it also provides welcome reminder of why we must continue to fight ",0
"Even though I personally was in attendance back in 1976 when Archbishop Lefebvre delivered this address in Minneapolis , I was only ten years old and of course did n't realize how prophetic he was on that occasion , or how devastated by the Second Vatican Council , the New Mass , and the Freemasonic infiltration of the Vatican ",0
"In fact , this transcript reads like a message of encouragement at a crucial moment in the history of this movement — Stay in the fight ! ",1
Keep the Faith ,1
Never surrender ! ,1
"This address also makes it absolutely clear that everything Archbishop Lefebvre did was part of an eleventh - hour defence of the Kingship of Christ ( ignored completely by the Second Vatican Council ) and a desperate last stand for Tradition , the infallible teachings of Mother Church and of course her ancient liturgy ",1
"And now that Pope Francis has inadvertently unmasked the true spirit of Vatican II , it becomes obvious how and why those who resisted that spirit were right to have done so and will certainly be hailed by history as the heroic band of Catholic brothers that mounted the twentieth century ’s last stand for Christ the King and , while scorned and mocked at the time , were nevertheless totally vindicated fifty years later ",0

"And I hope that you can understand my poor English , but I think it is better to speak some bad English because to translate would take too much time ",0
"As Mr. Matt said , the crisis in the Church is very extraordinary ",0
It is very difficult to understand the situation today ,0
"My seminary in Econe ( in Switzerland ) and the seminaries in Germany and here in America , in Armada , are in very difficult situations with Rome ",0
Why ? ,0
These seminaries are the same as seminaries were before the Second Vatican Council ,0
"They have the same discipline and the same studies , they make good priests ; I think they are good seminarians ",0
All is done as all the seminaries before the Second Vatican Council ,0
Why are we now in this very sad situation with Rome ? ,0
"I think that because in the Second Vatican Council , and after the Council , there is a mutation , a change , in the Church ",1
But we do not change ,0
We continue the Tradition ,0
"So why do they now say , as Mgr ",0
"( Archbishop ) Benelli[1 ] said to me months ago on the 19th of March , “ you are out of communion with the Church ",0
” I am out of communion with the Church because I continue the Tradition of the Church ? ,0
This is possible ? ,0
I do not understand ,0
Why ? ,0
I have done nothing ,0
I believe nothing other than what the Church has believed for twenty centuries ,0
Mgr ,0
"Benelli then said to me , you must put down in a writing to the Holy Father that you accept the Second Vatican Council , you accept the reform that followed the Council , and that you accept the orientations that have been given by Rome ",0
Mgr ,0
"Benelli took the book of the New Ordo , gave it to me , and said , “ You must say this New Mass in all of your houses ",0
” ,0
I wonder why Mgr ,0
Benelli did not communicate this condition to me before our meeting ,0
[ 2 ] He could have done so ,0
"For example , one year ago three cardinals sent me a letter ( Cardinals Wright , Tabera [ Arturo Carinal Tabera Araoz , one of the Council Fathers MJM ] , and Gabriel - Marie Garrone ) telling me ( in effect ) that I must close the seminaries ",0
"Well , I refused , because I refuse to contribute to the destruction of the Church ",1
Because now they are destroying the Church ,1
"When I die and go before the judge , God will not be able to say to me , “ You destroyed the Church ",1
” I refused to contribute to the destruction of the Church ,1
I am sure that my seminaries are contributing to the restoration of the Church ,0
I do not destroy the Church ,0
And so I said to Mgr ,0
"Benelli , “ No , I will not sign that writing ",0
” ,0
I think that the mutation in the Church came in through the Second Vatican Council ,1
And do you think this change in the Church came suddenly ? ,0
"When , then ? ",0
At the beginning of the Council ? ,0
"No , this change in the Church began one century before [ the Council ] ",0
"Pope Pius VI said during the French Revolution that if the Church continues to remain under the influence of the prince of the revolution , then , in the future a crisis will come upon the Church ",1
"In [ 1844 ] , Pope Pius IX ordered Cardinal Rigoli to publish the Instructions of the Carbonari ",0
[ 3 ] The Pope himself asked Cardinal Rigoli to publish the Instructions of the Carbonari ,0
And what did these Instructions say ? ,0
The Instructions said that they [ the Carbonari / Freemasons ] must begin to fight against the Church by bringing reform into the Church ,0
"The Instructions said the infiltration will take perhaps not one year , perhaps not ten years , but perhaps a century ",0
"The Carbonari must enter into the seminary , into the convent , into the sacristy , and slowly , very slowly , the priests will have the ideals of the revolution ; of the Freemasons ",0
"One day these priests , imbued with Masonic principles , will become bishops , and these bishops can then choose a pope ",0
"And even if the pope is not a Freemason , he will have the same ideals as the Freemasons ",0
Pope Pius IX called for the publishing of these Instructions in order to warn the bishops and priests of those times of the fight against the church ,0
"In 1895 , the Catholic Antonia Fogazzaro , a known modernist , founded a masonic lodge in Milan ",0
"He wrote in his book , Il Santo , that “ We [ modernists] … want a reform in the Church … without rebellion , carried out by legitimate authority … even if this takes 20 , 30 , or 50 years.”[4 ] “ The reform will have to be brought about in the name of obedience ",0
” The modernist ideas in the Church introduced and enacted through obedience ! ,0
"And I think … well , here we are ! ",0
In this time ! ,0
"The reform is here , and it is brought about through obedience , to the Council , to the bishop , to the priest ",0
"And all they say is “ Obedience , obedience , obedience ",0
” ,0
"The Instructions of the Carbonari say the bishop and the priest will think that they are following the tiara of the Pope , but they will be following the flag of Freemasonry [ “ the banner of revolution ” ] ",0
They said that ,1
They wrote that ! ,1
One century before [ the Council ] ! ,0
"Thus , it is very important to know that they prepared for the beginning of the Second Vatican Council for a century , perhaps two centuries ! ",0
"As the Archbishop of Dakar and President of the Episcopal Commission for French - speaking West Africa , I was appointed member of the Central Preparatory Commission of the Second Vatican Council ",0
"There were some seventy cardinals , twenty bishops , and four super - authorities of the religious orders , among others ",0
Before the last meeting of this Commission the members received two schemas on the same subject : one from Cardinal Ottaviani and another from Cardinal Bea ,0
"The schema from Cardinal Ottaviani was titled “ … On Religious Tolerance ” and the other , from Cardinal Bea , was titled “ On Religious Freedom [ Liberty ] ",0
"” When we read these two schemas , we thought , “ This is impossible ",0
How is it we can receive two opposing theses ? ,0
One says we must not tolerate error ,0
The other says that error has the right to exist in the name of the dignity of the human person ,0
"” And so , we go into the meeting ",0
"Cardinal Ottaviani , standing , says to Cardinal Bea , “ You have no authority to compose this schema , because it is a theological thesis and therefore within the competence of the Theological Commission ",1
"” As Cardinal Bea stands up , he says , “ I do have the right to compose this schema because if anything concerns Christian Unity it is religious liberty , and I am the President of the Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity ",1
"” Cardinal Bea , addressing Cardinal Ottaviani , further said , “ I am opposed to your schema ",1
” ,0
Impossible ! ,1
"We were in a very sad , serious situation ",1
"Cardinal Ruffini had to intervene as we were in front of two cardinals , our brothers ",0
He said we must wait for the authority to say who is right and who is wrong ,0
But before the Pope came ( because the Pope came many times to present at these meetings ) we voted on the schema ,0
Who is with Cardinal Ottaviani ? ,0
Who is with Cardinal Bea ? ,0
The conservatives and the liberals ,0
"As the last meeting of the Preparatory Commission , it was for me the first image of the future Council ",0
This historic address appeared for the first time ever in a print edition of The Remnant last year ,0
Is n't it time for you to subscribe ? ,0
"And as we go into the Council , you know that on the first day of the Council , Cardinal Lienart was the chief of the liberal cardinals in the Council , [ together ] with all of the Cardinals of the Rhine ( such as Cardinal Alfrink , Cardinal Frings , Cardinal Dopfner , Cardinal Suenens , Cardinal Leinart , and Cardinal Koenig of Austria ) ",0
"And now one month ago in Rome , the traditional periodical Chiesa Viva published a photo of Cardinal Lienart with all of the appurtenances of Freemasonry , the date of his inscription in Masonry , the date [ of his rising to ] the 20th Degree of Freemasonry , the date [ of his rising to ] the 30th Degree of Freemasonry , and the places where he [ attended ] the meetings of Freemasonry ",1
This Cardinal was the chief of the liberals in the Council ,0
"That is my cardinal ; he ordained me to the priesthood , and he consecrated me a bishop ",0
And now this is public ,0
Nobody has been able to refute the publication ,0
"And so , we have ( I am confident ) a mutation in the church by the Council and by the reform after the Council ",1
"Now , some say the Council is ( was ) good , but only the reforms were bad ",0
That is not true ,0
Why ? ,0
"Because when the reforms come , Rome always says the reforms are being done in the name of the Council ",0
In the name of the Council ! ,1
It is evident that all of the reforms came from the Council ,0
"And if the reforms are bad , then it is impossible that the Council is good and all the reforms are bad , because that is the authentic interpretation of the Council by Rome ",1
"Rome said in the name of the Declaration of Liturgy , we [ implement ] the liturgical reform ",0
"We can say that [ these bad changes are ] not in the text of the Declaration , but this man has the authority to say that this is from the Council ",0
They know that ,0
And I am sure that it [ the mutation ] is in the Council ,0
"Even if it is not explicitly [ stated ] in the Council but [ rather ] in the spirit of the Council , it is the same ! ",0
"For example , with religious freedom : now the Holy See and all the Nuncios are against the Catholic State in the name of the Council - in the name of the Declaration of Religious Freedom ",0
I have heard this ( personally ) twice ,0
The first time I was in Columbia ,0
"When I was in Columbia , I read in the paper about the change in the first article of the Constitution of the Republic of Columbia ",0
[ The first article ] stated that only the Republic of Columbia recognizes only the Catholic religion ,0
They changed it ,0
They removed this article ,0
I read the discourse of the President of Columbia with the Nuncios of Columbia and the Secretary of the Episcopal Conference in Columbia ,0
"The President said he is very , very anxious ",1
"He said to the people , “ even though we remove this article we remain Catholic ",0
"I am a Catholic , I shall remain Catholic , and I do everything possible for the Council and the Catholics in our country ",1
” ,0
"Then , the discourse of the Nuncio was the discourse of a Freemason : all of it was “ progress , ” “ humanity , ” “ evolution , ” and all the hubris of a Freemason ",0
"And during the discourse of the Secretary of the Episcopal Conference , [ the Secretary ] said , “ in the name of the Declaration of Religious Freedom [ of Vatican II ] , we ask the President to remove this article in the Constitution ",1
” ,0
"I met this Secretary of the Episcopal Conference during my visit in Columbia , and he said for two years they [ had been asking ] the President , in the name of the Holy See , to change this article in their Constitution ",1
"But I will never … I do not accept the concept , because you destroy the Catholic State in the name of the Council ",0
Are you sure ? ,0
"Yes , sure ",0
It is evident ,0
"Now I said to the [ Secretary ] , “ As I speak with you now about Columbia , I know that you are the one responsible for the change in the constitution of Valais in Switzerland one year ago ",0
The change in the Constitution of Valais was the same ,0
” ( Because you know Switzerland is a Federation where some states are Protestant and some states are Catholic ,0
The Valais is Catholic ,0
"And in its constitution , the words of the first article [ of the constitution ] of the State of Valais – Econe , where we are located , is in the State of Valais - only one religion is recognized : The Catholic Church ",0
) ,0
"And [ the Secretary ] said , “ Yes , I am responsible for this change ",0
"” Brother , what did you do with the Social Kingship of Christ ? ",0
What is this for you ? ,0
"What do you say when you say “ thy kingdom come ” in your prayer , the Our Father ? ",0
"“ Ah , ” the Nuncio said to me , “ Now it is impossible ",0
"” What did you do with the encyclical of Pope Pius XI , Quas Primas ? ",0
"“ Ah , but now the Pope can not write an encyclical like Quas Primas ",0
” ,0
It is incredible ,0
And all in the name of the Council ,1
"We must take care , because this change in the church is a liberal change ",1
"The liberal principles have entered the Church now , and they destroy the Church ",1
"If we can not set out the true principles of the Church , if we in the name of religious freedom said that all religions have the same right in every state in the world … ",0
[ missing audio ... ] ,0
The truth is the only one King of the World is Jesus Christ ,0
"We say in the Gloria in Excelsis Deo , “ Tu solus Altissimus , ” “ Tu solus Dominus , ” “ You alone are the Highest , ” “ You alone are the Lord ",0
"” But practically , we would refuse this Kingdom of Jesus Christ if we said that Luther , Mohammed , Buddha and Jesus Christ are all the same ",0
We can not say that ,0
Impossible ,1
We know that in many states ( it is a pity ) it is impossible [ to recognize Catholicism as the state religion ] ,0
We must tolerate - have tolerance for the error - but never give the same right to error and truth ,1
That is impossible ,1
And the change in the liturgy is very important ,0
It is very bad ,0
"One of the principles of modern man , as they say now , “ modern man , ” is democracy ",0
And democracy can have a good sense but not if [ by that term is meant ] that those who govern receive their authority from the people ,0
The authority comes from God ,1
Not from the people ,1
Not from the masses ,1
From God ,1
"But today the principle , the democratic principle , is that the authority is in the people ",1
It is in the masses ,1
That is not true ,0
It is impossible ,0
And our liturgy is the school of our Faith ,0
It is the first school of our Faith for all people ,0
I was in Africa as a missionary and as bishop for 30 years ,0
I know the liturgy was the best school of the Faith for people who can not read ,0
They can see what the priest does ,0
They can see what the priest does at the adoration of the Body and the Blood of Jesus Christ ,0
And they know that Jesus Christ is present - His real presence is on the altar - by the attitude of the priest ,0
They know that ,0
That is very important ,0
But the change in the Mass destroys the Church ,1
Because we know the liturgy teaches us hierarchy ,0
The true liturgy is hierarchical ,0
It is not democratic but hierarchical ,1
Why ? ,0
"Because we have God , the priest , and then the people ",0
That is hierarchy ,0
When we are in Church we know God is on the altar ; the priest is between God and the people ; and the people receive God at the hand of the priest ,0
That is hierarchy ,1
But now the new liturgy is more democratic - all around the table ,0
"The priest is only the president , and sometimes another man can take the role of the president of the meal ",0
That is a new liturgy ,0
"That is very bad , because we have no sense of the hierarchical ; whereas the sense of hierarchy is very important in our life ",0
We need the authority of God ,0
We need the Real Presence of God on our altar ,0
We need the Sacrifice of the Mass – not a meal only – but the Sacrifice ,0
"So , the Victim of the Sacrifice is really present on our altar ",0
That is the school of our Faith ,0
"And slowly , slowly , this new Mass equivocates ",0
It moves the minds of the faithful in a Protestant [ direction ] ,0
I do not say that all [ Novus Ordo ] Masses are invalid ,0
I do not say that ,1
"But perhaps , more and more , they become invalid because [ the ministers lose faith in the Real Presence ] ",0
"Recently , in France , a progressive paper conducted a statistical survey to see how many priests no longer have faith in the Real Presence ",0
"They found that twenty - two percent no longer have the faith , the belief in the Real Presence ",1
"But I think that if they directed this question to all of the priests who are under 50 years of age , they would find that fifty percent [ have lost the faith in the Real Presence ] , because the young priests have no faith ",0
No faith ,1
"Last year , Bishop Adam ( in our Diocese of Sion , Switzerland ) ordained one priest for my Congregation of the Holy Ghost Fathers ",0
This one priest came from France ,0
His uncle had died in a road accident when his cab fell in the river ,0
The uncle had nine children ,0
"The Bishop said to the new priest , “ Now you can say Mass for your uncle ",0
"Now you are a priest , and you can say Mass for your uncle ",0
"” The new priest said , “ No , never ",0
” Why ? ,0
It is not useful to say Mass for the dead ? ,0
"“ No , no , it is impossible ",0
They are already in heaven ,0
” This young priest who was ordained by the Bishop last year for my Congregation is now a professor in the minor seminary in Switzerland ,0
"They are not learning theology , not philosophy , not anything ",0
They learn nothing now ,1
Another example ,0
"Recently , I had two young [ potential ] seminarians come to my house near Paris ",0
"One of them works in a factory , and the other is a university student ",0
They told me they were [ considering ] the seminary of Paris ,0
"I asked them , “ Why do you come to see me ? ” They told me that they had a meeting in the house of the Oblate of Maria with the priest who oversees young men who may have vocations to the priesthood in the Diocese of Paris ",0
There was a total of fifteen young men for all of the Diocese of Paris ,0
"During the meeting , the priest , before he celebrated the Eucharist , said , “ Today we celebrate the Eucharist , but we do not believe in the Real Presence ",0
” These two young men said “ That is impossible ,1
We can not remain in this seminary ,0
"” So , they came to meet me ",0
They said that Econe is the only seminary where they seem to be able to find the True Faith ,0
They asked for admittance to Econe ,0
And I think that they shall be coming to Econe next October ,0
But that is a new religion ,0
It is a Protestant religion ,0
That is a fact ,1
"Perhaps you can say , “ How is it possible that the pope gives the authorization to this change ? ",1
How is it possible the pope signed this decree ? ,1
Signed this constitution ? ” I do n’t know ,1
I do n’t know ,1
It is a big mystery ,0
A big mystery ,1
There are many proposed theological answers ,0
I can not subscribe to all of them ,0
Some say the pope is not responsible ,0
"Perhaps someone gave the pope an injection , a drug , and he is not responsible ",0
"Perhaps , I do n’t know ",0
Some say there are two popes [ ( a body double ) ] ,0
I do n’t know ,1
"Some say the pope was liberal before he was elected pope , and perhaps ( we do not know ) he gave his name to Freemasonry ( thereby incurring excommunication before the conclave ) ",0
We do not know ,0
"We do know now that Bugnini was primarily responsible for the change in liturgy , and that he is an infamous Freemason ",1
"And because he had an indiscretion with his Masonic appurtenances , the Pope sent him as a Nuncio in Iran ",0
I do n’t know ,1
We do n’t know ,1
"Now , you can not say that Archbishop Lefebvre said the pope gave his name to Freemasonry ",0
"No , you can not say that ",0
"It is possible , but we do not know ",1
"But if he was excommunicated , then he is not pope ",0
Not pope ,1
Illegitimate ,0
I do n’t know ,0
It is a mystery I can not understand ,0
"But the fact is that the Catholic Church is being destroyed , and now even the pope himself says that ",0
This pope has referred to the auto - demolition of the Church ,0
"He said , “ The smoke of Satan has entered the Church ",1
” But where are the men responsible for the destruction of the Church ? ,0
"Well , there they are ",0
They are the men who destroy the Church ,0
We must show where they are ,0
Where is this smoke of Satan that has entered the Church ? ,1
"I do not know , but it is the pope himself who said that ",0
And I have these experiences every day ,0
I visit many countries ,0
I was in Spain during the Christmas Holy Days ,0
"Then I was in Bonn , near Cologne , Germany , three weeks ago , to speak at a conference ",0
Many people came ,0
Many people are confused ,0
What is happening in the Church ? ,0
They are anxious ,0
But many people say that we disobey ,0
Disobey ? ,0
Obedience is relative ,0
It is not absolute ,0
"It is relative to the good , but not to the evil ",0
We can not obey our parents if they command a bad thing ,0
We can not obey ,0
It is clear ,0
"And I know that in Spain , for example , the situation in the Church is very bad ",0
"The new nominees of bishops and many auxiliary bishops are , approximately , communist , Marxist , and socialist ",0
"And so , a majority of the bishops in the Episcopal Conference of Spain are progressives ",0
They are modernists ,0
"Whereas , the majority of the bishops [ from Spain ] during the Council were conservative ",0
"So , Rome is responsible [ for the situation of the Church in Spain ] because it is Rome who approves the nominations for bishops ",0
"And we know in France , in Germany , and in Europe generally , that all of the young bishops are worse [ than the bishops in Spain ] in that they are more or less Marxist ",0
That is a fact ,0
That is impossible ,0
How can they do that ? ,0
I do not know ,0
I do not know ,1
I have not spent my whole life in Rome ,0
"I do know Rome very well , because I was an apostolic delegate , and I was in the Secretariate of the Secretary of State ",0
And I know that very well ,0
"But I think that the devil is in Rome , as was said by our Lady of Fatima and Our Lady of La Salette ",1
We must pray ,0
We must ask God to put an end to this crisis of the Church ,0
"Because if this crisis continues , many people will go to hell ",1
They lose the faith ,0
They can not go into the church ,0
They abandon the faith ,0
You know that many priests have abandoned the faith ,0
Many priests have gotten married ,0
And many sisters have abandoned their congregations ,0
It is a pity ,0
And it is everywhere ,0
"I was in Melbourne , Australia , during the 40th International Eucharistic Congress ",0
"Cardinal Knox , who was the man responsible for the Eucharistic Congress , is now the Prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship ",0
I read in the newspaper about a Mass Cardinal Knox celebrated during the Eucharistic Congress where sensual dancing was performed at the same time the words of the Consecration were pronounced ,1
That is a sacrilege ,1
You can not go to that Mass. ,0
That is sacrilege ,1
This is a fact ,0
They also called me by phone in Melbourne to say I was on the list of the bishops [ attending ] the Eucharistic Congress ,0
They asked me to concelebrate Mass with a Protestant pastor and a rabbi ,0
Ay ,1
Impossible ,1
Impossible ,1
"No , no , no , no ",1
[ applause ] ,0
This change is not accidental ,0
It is not superficial ,0
It is very deep ,0
Very bad ,0
It is against our faith ,0
Against our faith ,1
"And so , we can not accept this Council and this reform and this orientation even though it comes from Rome ",0
From Rome we expect only the good ,0
"We do not expect the bad , the ill ",0
We do not expect the abandonment of adoration in the Mass. ,0
We need this adoration ,0
We need to have the faith in the divinity of Jesus Christ ,0
"Because all [ of this change ] is [ oriented ] against the divinity of Jesus Christ , against the Kingdom of Jesus Christ , against the Real Presence of Jesus Christ in the Mass. ",0
"It is a sin when we abandon the truth of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ , everywhere , and we abandon the Faith of the divinity of Jesus Christ ",0
He is King because he is God ,0
He is the Son of God ,0
"So , He is King by His nature ",0
This is essential ,0
Essential ! ,1
"And if He is God , we must give Him the adoration of God ",1
"And so , we can not accept the diminution of this Truth ",0
Jesus Christ is the Son of God ,0
Jesus Christ is God ,0
That is a fundamental truth of our Faith ,0
And it all depends on this Truth ,0
And we know now that the theologians and the bishops have [ a new orientation ] ,0
They do not express this truth clearly and perfectly ,0
They are afraid of the truth ,0
That is very bad ,0
And it is the same in Rome ,0
"I think they refuse [ to grant me an audience with ] the pope , [ because they are afraid of the Truth ] ",0
"When I was in Rome one month ago , Mgr ",0
Benelli told me he visits the pope every day ,0
"He said that when he left me , he would go immediately to the pope to express the importance of the work we had conducted during our meeting ",0
"Immediately , he said , he would be going ",0
"So , why do they not grant me the possibility of visiting the pope ? ",0
Because they are afraid ,0
Meanwhile the Vatican operated a veritable swinging door where actual heretics and schismatics were concerned ,0
"Here , again , is Blessed Paul VI , famously meeting for the first time ever with the heretic Archbishop of Canterbury in St. Peter 's : ",0
"Cardinal Villot said , “ We are afraid if Msgr ",0
Lefebvre meets and speaks with the pope that perhaps the pope will change his mind ,0
” Because [ the pope ] is not too sure ; the pope is not man of true conviction ,1
He is a mysterious man ,0
We can not give a definition of the man ,0
"He expresses the truth , and then he does the contrary / opposite ",0
Some part of him will speak the truth ,0
Another part of him is open to error ,0
Very curious ,0
And they are afraid that if I reveal the truth [ and tell the Pope ] “ you must affirm the Kingdom of Jesus Christ everywhere and always each day ,0
"You must affirm the Real Presence in the Mass - in the Sacrifice of the Mass , ” then perhaps it is possible that the Pope will change his mind ",0
"And so , Cardinal Villot says , there is a confusion , and they do not want me to visit the pope ",0
It is impossible to admit me ,0
And I know the pope very well ! ,0
"When I was the apostolic delegate to Pius XII , I was going to Rome every year ",0
"And during those eleven years , I met Msgr ",0
Montini ,0
I know him very well ,1
"He received me twice during the Council , for a private audience with the pope ",0
"But , now , with my position against the Council and the reforms , he says : “ No , impossible ! ",0
You must sign in writing that you [ accept ] the Council and all the reforms before I will receive you in audience ,0
” But I can not do that ,0
"For me , if I do that , then I betray my mother , the Church ",1
The Church ! ,1
"So , I thank you very much for your encouragement , and I must say that we have a very good generation of young men and good vocations ",0
"For the coming year we have 59 applications to our seminary in Econe , Switzerland – applications from the United States , from England , from Germany , from France , and Spain ",0
Good young men with good dispositions are coming from everywhere ,0
And why ? ,0
Why do they come to this seminary when they know we are in difficulties with Rome ? ,0
They know that ,0
But still they come ,0
"I ask them , why do you come to Econe ? ",0
You know our situation ,0
"They say , “ Yes , we know your situation , but we want to become true priests and not protestant pastors or modernist priests ",0
We are coming to your seminary because we know that the end of the priest is to offer the true Sacrifice of the Mass. ,0
"And so , we are Coming to Econe ",0
” ,0
"And as I have visited my seminary here in Armada for the past five days , I can see it is the same here ",0
We have very good young men ,0
I also have some Americans in my seminary in Econe ,0
"In six weeks I will ordain one American priest from Detroit , who is a very good seminarian and will be a good priest ",0
But these young men refuse to become protestants ,0
They refuse to become modernist ,0
They ask to become true priests ,0
And it is a pity there are not 100 bishops opening good seminaries ,0
"So , I ask you to pray for these seminarians because when they become priests they will have many worries and many difficulties ",0
"I think , however , they are very well prepared to deal with these difficulties and worries ",0
And we have confidence in God ,0
"Since I began this work six years ago , now , I have evidence that God is assisting us ",0
"Because it is impossible , I realize , to do this by myself ",0
"We now have houses in Switzerland ( 3 ) , Munich , France ( 6 ) , Brussels ( 1 ) , England , Armada , San Francisco , and New York ",0
"In Albano , near Rome , we have a congregation of sisters where I have five vocations from the states ( good sisters ) ",0
And I am building a seminary in Switzerland ,0
It is impossible to do all this without God ’s assistance ,1
"So , I have confidence ",0
It is impossible for the Church to change its tradition ,0
The tradition of twenty centuries ,0
That we can not change ,1
The Church is tradition ,0
The Church is tradition ,1
It is not revolution ,0

The Washington Post first reported on the story prior to Trump ’s tweet ,0
Trump and Tillerson have had a fraught relationship for many months ,0
"Trump told reporters Tuesday that he ultimately decided to fire the secretary because they disagreed over strategy in key areas of foreign policy , such as the 2015 Iran nuclear deal , the approach to North Korea and the overall tone of U.S. diplomacy ",0
"Tillerson said he received a call from Trump around noon Tuesday , more than three hours after his firing was first reported by The Washington Post and announced minutes later in a tweet from the president ",0
"His voice quivering , Tillerson thanked career diplomats for their “ honesty and integrity ” and the American people for “ acts of kindness , ” and he singled out Defense Secretary Jim Mattis for their partnership and mutual support of diplomacy ",1
But he notably did not thank Trump or praise his policies ,0
Tillerson said he will remain in his post until March 31 but is delegating all authorities for running the State Department to Deputy Secretary John Sullivan and is committed to ensuring “ an orderly and smooth transition ,0
” The deposed diplomat also made a clear statement about Russian aggression : “ Much work remains to respond to the troubling behavior and actions on the part of the Russian government ,1

Two White House officials told the Associated Press that Tillerson found out he was fired Friday ,0
"The secretary got a call from White House chief of staff John Kelly but only got told an unspecified presidential tweet concerning him may be coming , officials at the State Department told the wire service ",0
"Later , the White House fired Goldstein , who contradicted the administration ’s account of Tillerson ’s ouster , according to NBC News and the AP ",0
Goldstein was the under secretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs ,0
Trump later told reporters he disagreed with Tillerson on some issues and feels the diplomat “ will be much happier now ,1

I 'll Say What Kavanaugh Would n't : Christine Ford Was Part Of The Political Hit On Him & Here 's The Audio Evidence ,0
"On Thursday , following the hearings where Dr. Christine Ford provided testimony under oath without any evidence at all of a 36-year - old alleged sexual attack by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge , Kavanaugh denied the allegations and blasted Senate Democrats for their involvement in ruining his good name ",1
"However , when asked by Senator Cory Booker whether or not Kavanaugh thought Ford was part of what Kavanaugh referred to as a """""""" political hit """""""" against him , Kavanaugh rightly steered clear of a public relations disaster ",1
"However , I am willing to say would he would not : Of course , she was part of it ! ",1
I do n't say this lightly ,0
There are many things that we heard from Ford on Thursday that indicate there is more going on than she was willing to say ,0
"Clearly , Ford has been outed as a radical political activist who promotes baby murder and other unlawful actions ",1
"However , her story did n't exactly lend credibility except with Democrat members of the Senate Judiciary Committee , one of which has openly professed to sexual assault ",1

She did n't seem distraught over that ,0
She was n't angry it was made public ,1
Why ? ,1
She knew it would be made public ,1
"Ricki Seidman , a Democratic operative and former Clinton White House official who is now an advisor to Mrs. Ford , said in July ( at roughly the same time as the letter was submitted ) that she predicted a """""""" strategy """""""" forming to destroy Brett Kavanaugh ",1
She suggested a “ strategy will emerge ” to destroy Trump 's nomination for the Supreme Court in a conference call with the American Constitution Society in July ,1
"“ I do think that over the coming days and weeks there will be a strategy that will emerge , and I think it ’s possible that strategy might ultimately defeat the nominee , ” Seidman said in audio that was recorded by the Republican National Committee ’s War Room ",0

"If you think Mrs. Ford is ignorant of this considering her father works for the Central Intelligence Agency and her prior criminal political activism , then you are n't thinking clearly ",1
Ford obviously has mental issues and that was on display on Thursday during her testimony ,1
She clearly tried to present herself as a victim while she accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault with absolutely no evidence ,1
Kavanaugh even responded by pointing out that even her friends said they do n't recall such an incident and had literally hundreds of people commend his character as the direct opposite of what Ford claims ,0
"As I 've said before , I do n't support Kavanaugh 's appointment to the Supreme Court on the grounds of lack of constitutional rulings , but that attack on him was orchestrated , it was political and Ford was a part of it ",1
It 's wrong ,0
"Ford did n't even think to act , according to her testimony , until Kavanaugh was on the short list , but did she go to local law enforcement ? ",1
Nope ,0
"She went to her US Democrat representative , Senator Dianne Feinstein and The Washington Post ",0
"If that is not political , I do n't know what is ",0

"Francis and Farrell ’s ' Sinod ' on the Youth , # StopThe Synod2018 ",1
"During the last 5 years of this papacy , Francis and his Synodal Schemers masterfully manipulated , rigged , and exploited the synodal process ",1
"The backdoor tactics and machinations were brilliantly documented by Edward Pentin , Henry Sire , George Neumayr and an array of investigative journalists ",0
"The fool doth think he is wise , but the wise man knows himself to be a fool ",0
"– Shakespeare , As You Like It Pope Francis and Cardinal Farrell sit with students at the 2018 pre - synodal meeting for young people ",0
The upcoming October 2018 Synod of Bishops guarantees more synodal antics as the doctrinal culmination of the “ Who Am I to Judge ” mantra and the recantation of Church teaching on homosexuality ,0
Pope Francis announced in the Pre - Synodal meeting that the Church will be listening to all the young people and that “ no one will be excluded ,0
” That ’s code language that the Pope will be “ dialoging ” and “ accompanying ” and “ hearing ” the pro - LBGT agenda ,0
"Oh , the providential irony ! ",0
"The two themes of the upcoming Synod of Bishops in Rome are none other than , Youth and Vocations ",0
Sound familiar ? ,0
Do I hear the Pennsylvania Grand Jury Report ? ,0
How inconvenient that the two targets of predatory clerics and prelates will be the subject of the Synod of Bishops ,1
"How inconvenient that the head of the Synod on Youth and Vocations , Cardinal Kevin Farrell , was the former roommate of the most prolific serial predator of youth and seminarians in the history of the American Church ",1
"How inconvenient that Farrell , Head of this Synod on Youth , roomed with the notorious Cardinal Theodore McCarrick for six years and never knew anything about McCarrick ’s predatory behavior ",1
How inconvenient that a global homosexual clergy predation scandal is erupting at a time when Francis wants the Synod to minimize that nagging and unmerciful Catholic catechism doctrine of homosexuality as “ intrinsically disordered ” by exploiting the naive views of the youth at the Synod ,1
"How inconvenient that homosexual predation is bankrupting the American Church and the Instrumentum Laboris , the working document of this Vatican Synodal Agenda , embraces the relaxation of the Church teachings on homosexuality ",1
"How inconvenient that the homosexual network of clergy and prelates were blasted as predators and coverup enablers in the Pennsylvania Grand Jury Report , while the Instrumentum Laboris argues that : ",1
"“ Some LGBT youths , through various contributions that were received by the General Secretariat of the Synod , wish to benefit from greater closeness and experience greater care by the Church , while some Bishop Conferences ask themselves what to suggest to young people who decide to create homosexual instead of heterosexual couples and , above all , would like to be close to the Church ",0
” § 197 IL ,0
"How inconvenient that during a global prelate homosexual coverup scandal , the 2018 Synodal Bishop Conferences are exploring for ways during the Synod to discuss ways in which homosexual youths want to be “ closer ” to the Church ! ",1
"How inconvenient that since 2013 during Francis’ impromptu airplane presser when he cleverly sent a powerful message to homosexual clerics , “ Who Am I to Judge , ” now Francis must judge the criminal predatory conduct of homosexual clergy and prelates who preyed on youth and seminarians ",1
The emerging homosexual clergy scandal is just beginning to unfold ,0
"The laity will learn over the course of the next few years that the underlying cause of the criminal scandal lies in the homosexual network of priests , bishops and cardinals who preyed on the youth , assaulted seminarians , promoted their own ilk , and punished any whistleblowers or noncompliant priests ",0
Here is the dirty secret that is now emerging ,1
Many in the hierarchy were active homosexuals who intentionally relaxed and ignored the Church ’s teaching and moral stance on homosexuality ,0
"The personal wreckage brutally portrayed in the Pennsylvania Grand Jury Report is the direct result of a clerical culture which embraced homosexuality and groomed , recruited , and assaulted young people into this sordid lifestyle ",1
"Many priests , bishops , and cardinals practiced what Francis preached , ‘ who am I to judge.’ ",1
The result ? ,0
"A litany of lives of total moral , physical , emotional devastation suffered by victims of homosexual clerics ",1
This is just the very beginning of the dark night of the soul of the Catholic Church ,0
The upcoming Synod and its embrace of the “ LGBT ” lifestyle makes a mockery of the suffering of the clergy victims and justifies the decades - old scandal ,1
"Be forewarned that inviting young people from ages 16 - 29 to the Synod to discuss vocations with Bishops poses serious moral and physical dangers to these unsuspecting youth , many of whom think homosexuality is cool ",1
And the Bishops know it ,0
The full extent of the clerical predation in the hierarchy will take years to uncover ,1
"Until it has , this Synod must be cancelled while the civil authorities and law enforcement fully investigate the breadth and depth of the homosexual clerical predation ",0
The warning signs and rainbow flags are flamboyantly flashing that the 2018 Synod on the Youth and Vocations in Rome presents great moral and physical exploitation of the youth ,0
"According to the Vatican , the chosen topic of the 2018 Synod , is an “ expression of the Church ’s pastoral concern for the young , ” and is in continuity with the findings of the two - fold synod on the family and Francis ’s post - synodal document Amoris Laetitia ",0
We ’ve caught on to his sneaky synodal tactics ,1
Francis cleverly uses the synodal process to relax church doctrine by employing secular tools of surveys and focus groups ,0
"And , if the necessary results are n’t computed , they will skewer the results ",0
Magisterium by majority vote or stuff the ballot box ,0
The only compelling “ expression of the Church ’s pastoral concern for the young ” belongs in the full and transparent cooperation of criminal investigations into predatory homosexual predation ,1
"Turn over the documents secret archives involving predation , both in the Vatican and in the chanceries around the globe ",0
That is the only expression that will demonstrate concern for the young ,0

Kavanaugh 's Nomination Saved ? ,0
Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh ’s outstanding performance at yesterday ’s evidentiary hearing featuring attempted rape accuser Christine Blasey Ford may have revived his embattled nomination for the highest court in America ,0
The meeting of the Senate Judiciary Committee showed the underhanded tactics employed by the Left against Judge Kavanaugh ,0
The nominee and Republican senators used the opportunity to attack desperate Democrats for their efforts at character assassination ,1
President Trump was delighted ,0
"“ Judge Kavanaugh showed America exactly why I nominated him [ , ] ” President Trump tweeted at 6:46 p.m. after the hearing wrapped up ",0
"“ His testimony was powerful , honest , and riveting ",0
"Democrats’ search and destroy strategy is disgraceful and this process has been a total sham and effort to delay , obstruct , and resist ",1
The Senate must vote ! ” ,1
"Ford , who claims Kavanaugh tried to rape her decades ago when he was a high school student , appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee for several hours Thursday ",0
Kavanaugh testified separately after Ford ’s testimony concluded ,0
Kavanaugh stole the show ,1
"The judge forcefully stood up for himself as his voice trembled with righteous indignation , calling out Democratic senators for plotting against him ",1
The behavior of several of the Democratic members of this committee at my hearing a few weeks ago was an embarrassment ,0
But at least it was just a good old - fashioned attempt at Borking ,0
Those efforts did n't work ,0
"When I did at least okay enough at the hearings that it looked like I might actually get confirmed , a new tactic was needed ",0
Some of you were lying in wait and had it ready ,0
"This first allegation was held in secret for weeks by a Democratic member of this committee , and by staff ",0
It would be needed only if you could n't take me out on the merits ,0
"When it was needed , this allegation was unleashed and publicly deployed over Dr. Ford 's wishes ",0
"And then , and then as no doubt was expected , if not planned , came a long series of false last - minute smears designed to scare me and drive me out of the process before any hearing occurred ",1
"Afraid of their own shadows , committee Republicans did n’t relish the prospect of their all - male team of 11 senators questioning a woman so they hired sex - crimes prosecutor Rachel Mitchell of Maricopa County , Arizona , to examine Ford ",1
Opinions differ widely on how Mitchell performed ,0
"She tiptoed around the alleged sexual assault itself , instead focusing on process - related questions , presumably in an effort to show undecided senators how Ford and her handlers have been unfairly manipulating the process ",0
"In much of her testimony , Ford came across as presentable and seemingly credible , though vague and sometimes evasive , her ridiculous overall story notwithstanding ",1
"Ford did well enough that during the break between her testimony and Kavanaugh ’s , commentators on Fox News such as Brit Hume and Andrew Napolitano were openly musing about the nominee withdrawing , opinions that were sharply reversed after the nominee completed his testimony hours later ",0
It ’s not that Mitchell did a bad job creating an inventory of the irregularities in the process and of the odd behavior of Ford and her lawyers ,0
She could do little else ,0
She had many restrictions placed upon her and was only allowed to question Ford for minutes at a time before surrendering the floor to the next committee Democrat ,0
As commentator Sean Davis tweeted : ,0
"“ Hard to do much else when the witness conveniently has no corroborating evidence , no memory of any verifiable facts of what happened , and everyone she says was present at the alleged incident -- even her best friend -- has denied it ",1
” ,1
"Nonetheless , Mitchell ’s questioning came across at times as perfunctory , leading many observers to conclude that Republicans threw away a valuable opportunity by using her as a stand - in ",0
"She failed to lay a glove on a witness whose implausible , internally contradictory story cried out for vigorous cross - examination ",1
"In the end the too - deferential , easygoing Mitchell failed to provide much , if anything , in the way of evidence against Ford or in favor of Kavanaugh ",0
Whether her work will bring over fence - sitting senators to Kavanaugh ’s side remains to be seen ,0
"Like other Democrats , Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii tried to help Ford , lobbing her softballs ",1
"After saying she thought she knew what Mitchell was trying to get at in her questions , the senator said , “ so I 'll just ask you very plainly , Dr. Ford , is there a political motivation for your coming forward with your account of the assault by Brett Kavanaugh ? ” ",1
"“ No , and I 'd like to reiterate that again , I was trying to get the information to you while there was still a list of other what looked like equally - qualified candidates , ” Ford replied ",0
When Sen. Dick Durbin ( D - Ill ,0
") asked Ford “ with what degree of certainty do you believe Brett Kavanaugh assaulted you ? ” Ford replied , “ one hundred percent ",0
” ,0
"Strangely , Ford has a bad long - term memory and a bad short - term memory ",1
"She does n’t know when or where the alleged incident took place , yet she is “ one hundred percent ” certain it was Kavanaugh who attacked her ",0
"At the outset of the hearing , Grassley provided an overview of what Kavanaugh had gone through –including the Democrats’ sordid behavior— since President Trump announced the judge ’s nomination on July 9 ",0
"As part of the confirmation process , Kavanaugh endured his sixth background investigation since 1993 ",0
"“ Nowhere in any of these six FBI reports , which committee investigators have reviewed on a bipartisan basis , was there a whiff of any issue – any issue at all related in any way to inappropriate sexual behavior , ” Grassley said ",1
"Ford shared her allegations in a letter to the committee ’s ranking member , Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif ",0
") , in the summer ",0
"The letter remained secret from July 30 through until September 13 when he first learned about it , the chairman said ",0
"Instead of sharing the letter with the committee , Feinstein did nothing ",0
"Before the hearing , Kavanaugh met privately with 65 senators , including Feinstein , who did n’t ask him about the allegations when she met with him in August ",0
The committee held a four - day public hearing from September 4 to September 7 during which Kavanaugh testified for more than 32 hours in public ,0
"Feinstein did n’t attend it , Grassley said ",0
"Kavanaugh answered almost 1,300 written questions senators submitted after the hearing ",0
"That is “ more than all prior Supreme Court nominees , ” he said ",0
"“ Throughout this period , we did not know about the ranking member 's secret evidence ",0
"Then , only at an 11th hour , on the eve of Judge Kavanaugh 's confirmation vote , did the ranking member refer the allegations to the FBI ",0
"And then , sadly , the allegations were leaked to the press ",0
” ,0
"“ Every step of the way the Democratic side refused to participate in what should have been a bipartisan investigation , ” Grassley said ",0
"After Ford ’s identity became public , Grassley ’s staff “ contacted all the individuals she said attended the 1982 party described in the Washington Post article , ” he said ",0
Kavanaugh “ immediately submitted to an interview under penalty of felony for any knowingly false statements ,0
He denied the allegations categorically ,0
” ,0
"“ Democratic staff was invited to participate and could have asked any questions they wanted to , but they declined ",0
"Which leads me then to wonder : If they 're really concerned with going to the truth , why would n't you want to talk to the accused ? ” ",1
"Grassley said his staff contacted the other individuals who allegedly attended the party at which the conduct Ford complained of allegedly took place : Mark Judge , Patrick Smyth , and Leland Keyser ",0
"“ All three submitted statements to the Senate under – under penalty of felony , denying any knowledge of the events described by Dr. Ford ",0
"Dr. Ford 's lifelong friend , Dr. – Miss Keyser , stated she does n't know Judge Kavanaugh and does n't recall ever attending a party with him ",0
” ,0
"Grassley said his staff repeatedly sought to interview Ford over the past 11 days , “ even volunteering to fly to California to take her testimony , but her attorneys refused to prevent – present her allegations to Congress ",0
” ,0
"“ Consistent with their stated desires to obstruct Kavanaugh 's nomination ” by any means possible , “ pushed for FBI investigations into the allegations ",0
” ,0
"“ We 've been trying to investigate other allegations , ” Grassley said ",0
"“ At this time , we have not had cooperation from attorneys representing other clients , and they have made no attempt to substantiate their claims ",0
” ,0
"Attorneys for new Kavanaugh accusers Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnick have been approached by committee staff on eight and six occasions , respectively , Grassley said ",0
“ Neither attorney has made their clients available for interview ,0
The committee ca n't do an investigation if attorneys are stonewalling ,1
” ,0
"With his performance at the hearing , Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - S.C. ) , who is frequently a target of conservatives for going rogue on important issues , partly redeemed himself in the eyes of many conservatives ",1
"While questioning Kavanaugh , Graham lambasted the confirmation process the judge has been put through , calling it “ the most unethical sham since I 've been in politics ",1

Kate Steinle 's death at the hands of a Mexican national became a flashpoint in the immigration debate — here 's the story behind her killing ,0
"The surprise acquittal of Jose Ines Garcia Zarate in the shooting death of San Francisco woman Kate Steinle set off a firestorm of outrage Thursday night , as top conservatives and critics of so - called """""""" sanctuary cities """""""" pinned blame for Steinle 's death on illegal immigration and insufficiently aggressive deportation policies ",1
"Garcia Zarate , a 45-year - old Mexican national who was homeless and living in the US illegally when he fired the shot that killed Steinle , was acquitted by a jury on murder and manslaughter charges ",0
"The jury convicted him of the lesser charge of being a felon in possession of a gun , which carries a maximum sentence of three years in state prison ",0
"Steinle , 32 , was fatally shot while she walked along Pier 14 of the San Francisco Bay with her father in July 2015 ",0
The bullet that pierced her back had ricocheted off the concrete ground after it was fired by Garcia Zarate from a handgun belonging to a federal ranger that had been stolen four days earlier ,0
Garcia Zarate 's defense attorneys argued that the shooting was an accident — they said he found the gun wrapped in a T - shirt or cloth under a pier bench and unintentionally discharged it ,0
"Lead attorney Matt Gonzalez has argued that the weapon was a SIG Sauer with a """""""" hair trigger in single - action mode """""""" — a model well - known for accidental discharges even among experienced shooters ",1
"Gonzalez told the jury , according to the San Francisco Chronicle , that Garcia Zarate had never handled a firearm before , was frightened by the noise of the gunshot , then flung the weapon into the bay where it was later found by a diver ",0
"Prosecutors , however , alleged that Garcia Zarate brought the weapon to the pier deliberately to do harm , and intentionally aimed and shot Steinle after firmly pulling the trigger ",0
They said Garcia Zarate then threw the weapon into the bay and fled the scene ,0
"Beyond the shooting itself , perhaps the most controversial aspect of Garcia Zarate 's case involves his previous criminal activity and history of deportations , and how San Francisco and federal authorities handled his custody before he ever picked up the gun and shot Steinle ",0
"At the time of Steinle 's death , Garcia Zarate had been convicted of nonviolent drug crimes and deported five times since the early 1990s ",0
"He faced a sixth deportation in 2015 , and was in Justice Department ( DOJ ) custody that March after serving 46 months in prison for a felony re - entry into the US , but instead of transferring him into the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) for deportation , the department transferred him to the San Francisco County Jail for prosecution of a 1995 marijuana charge ",0
"San Francisco prosecutors , who had long ago deprioritized marijuana charges , dismissed the decades - old charge and released Garcia Zarate on April 15 , 2015 ",0
"Due to San Francisco 's policy of limiting cooperation with federal immigration authorities — which some refer to as a """""""" sanctuary """""""" policy — the city did not inform ICE when they released Garcia Zarate ",1
"As a result of the case , both the DOJ and the city of San Francisco have changed several policies ",0
The DOJ announced in 2016 it would no longer release potentially deportable detainees to local jails without first allowing ICE to take custody ,0
"San Francisco , meanwhile , has adjusted its policy to notify ICE if they are releasing suspected undocumented immigrants who face charges of serious or violent felonies ",0
""""""""" This tragedy could have been prevented if San Francisco had simply turned the alien over to ICE as we requested , instead of releasing him back onto the streets , """""""" ICE Director Thomas Homan said in a statement on Thursday ",1
""""""""" It is unconscionable that politicians across this country continue to endanger the lives of Americans with sanctuary policies while ignoring the harm inflicted on their constituents ",1
""""""""" ",1
But ICE has faced criticism of its own over not seeking a judicial warrant to legally obtain custody of Garcia Zarate when it discovered he had been transferred into San Francisco 's custody ,0
The agency has argued that obtaining judicial warrants are unnecessary and would place too much burden on ICE officials and federal courts ,0
"Though the agency did issue a request to the city to detain Garcia Zarate until ICE officials could pick him up , their detainer requests are not signed by a judge and are therefore not legally binding ",0
"San Francisco 's policy is to ignore such requests if they are not accompanied by judge - signed warrants , and the city has cited federal court cases concluding that such detentions violate inmates ' Fourth Amendment rights ",0
"Garcia Zarate 's deportation and criminal history made him an effective target for immigration hardliners , who argued that Steinle would still be alive were it not for an insecure border and lenient treatment toward suspected undocumented immigrants in local jails ",1
"President Donald Trump immediately seized on the verdict on Thursday as evidence of the perils of """""""" Illegal Immigration ",0
""""""""" ",0
"Trump frequently villainized Garcia Zarate and cited Steinle 's death during his presidential campaign , using the case to bolster his argument for a border wall and aid his crusade against """""""" sanctuary cities ",0
""""""""" ",0
"Early on Friday , Trump also falsely claimed on Twitter that Garcia Zarate had previously committed violent crimes and had illegally entered the US six times due to lax border security under the Obama administration ",0
""""""""" The Kate Steinle killer came back and back over the weakly protected Obama border , always committing crimes and being violent , and yet this info was not used in court ",1
His exoneration is a complete travesty of justice ,1
"BUILD THE WALL ! """""""" ",1
Trump tweeted ,0
"In fact , Garcia Zarate had never been convicted of a violent crime before Steinle 's shooting — his previous convictions were for nonviolent drug crimes and illegal entry ",0
"Lax border security , too , does not appear to be a factor since Garcia Zarate was caught by border patrol agents each time he entered the country under the Obama administration ",0
"In contrast , Steinle 's family has expressed nuanced views on immigration and """""""" sanctuary """""""" policies ",0
"They have both condemned Trump for """""""" sensationalizing """""""" Steinle 's death to advance anti - immigration policies , and expressed frustration with San Francisco officials , who they believe went too far in refusing to cooperate with federal immigration authorities ",0
Puerto Rico Hurricane Recovery Worsened By Nearly 1 Million Homes Built Illegally ,0
"After Hurricane Maria barreled through Puerto Rico in September 2017 , it left hundreds of thousands of people displaced and 80 to 90 percent of homes destroyed in some communities ",1
"But even before the hurricane , housing in the U.S. territory — where 43.5 percent of people live below the poverty line — was in crisis , and many homes on the island were built with salvaged fixtures and without permits , insurance or inspections ",0

Obama ’s Treason : Even Worse Than We Thought ,1

"This revelation comes after the news that came to light in February , that , according to Bill Gertz in the Washington Times , “ the U.S. government has traced some of the $ 1.7 billion released to Iran by the Obama administration to Iranian - backed terrorists in the two years since the cash was transferred ",0

It belonged to the Iranian government but was frozen and not paid since 1979 ,0
"” Indeed , and there was a reason for that : not even Jimmy Carter , who made the Islamic Republic of Iran possible , thought that money , which had been paid by the Shah ’s government in a canceled arms deal , belonged to the mullahs who overthrew the Shah ",0
"Likewise Reagan , George H. W. Bush , Clinton , and George W. Bush all thought that the Islamic Republic was not due money that was owed to the Shah ",0
Only Barack Obama did ,0
The definition of treason is giving aid and comfort to the enemy ,1
"The leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran order their people to chant “ Death to America ” in mosques every Friday , and repeatedly vow that they will ultimately destroy the United States of America and the state of Israel ",1
How was giving them billions and helping them skirt sanctions applied by the U.S. government not treason ? ,1
"Other Presidents have been incompetent , corrupt , dishonest , but which has committed treason on a scale to rival the treason of Barack Obama ? ",1
"The Iranians also operate a global network of jihad terror organizations , one of which , Hizballah , is quite active in Mexico now , with the obvious ultimate intention of crossing the border and committing jihad massacres of Americans ",1
"Obama has given a tremendous boost to these initiatives , as well as to Iran ’s nuclear program , with his nuclear deal that has given the Iranians hundreds of billions of dollars and essentially a green light to manufacture nuclear weapons , in exchange for absolutely nothing ",1
There is no telling when the worst consequences of Obama ’s aid and comfort to the Islamic Republic of Iran will be felt ,0
But they likely will be felt in one way or another ,0
"Even as President Trump moves swiftly to restore sanctions and put Iran on notice that its nuclear activity and global adventurism will not be tolerated , those billions can not be recovered , and the Iranians have already spent a great deal for their jihad cause ",0

Lawyer : Ammo dealer saw nothing suspicious in Vegas gunman ,0
"An Arizona man who sold ammunition to the gunman in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history was disturbed that he did n't spot any suspicious signs about his one - time customer , the man 's lawyer said Wednesday ",1
"Douglas Haig had no reason to believe Stephen Paddock would launch the Oct. 1 shooting in Las Vegas that killed 58 people , attorney Marc Victor said ",0
He said Haig wishes he could have figured out the intentions of Paddock but defends the sale of ammunition as legal ,0
""""""""" He wishes there was some clue that could have identified him , """""""" Victor said ",0
""""""""" There was just nothing ",0
""""""""" ",0
"Meanwhile , the coroner in Las Vegas started releasing redacted autopsy records about the 58 people killed in the mass shooting at an outdoor concert ",0
Records relating to Paddock were not being provided ,0
The records were released Wednesday in response to a public records lawsuit filed by The Associated Press and Las Vegas Review - Journal ,0
"Haig was named as a """""""" person of interest """""""" in the investigation by mistake Tuesday when court documents were released nearly four months after the shooting ",0
"The documents did not disclose why authorities considered Haig a person of interest , and officials have n't said whether he has since been cleared of that designation ",0
Victor said his client sold ammunition to Paddock once and does n't believe they have communicated since ,0
""""""""" He is as connected ( to Paddock ) as the guy who sold him a hamburger for lunch , """""""" Victor said ",1
"Las Vegas police and officials with the FBI , U.S. attorney 's office in Nevada and the federal Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives each declined Wednesday to comment about Haig or the investigation ",0
"A law enforcement official told The Associated Press in October that Paddock bought 1,000 rounds of tracer ammunition from a private seller he met at a Phoenix gun show three weeks before the shooting ",0
The official spoke anonymously because they were n't authorized to disclose case information ,0
Tracer bullets contain a pyrotechnic charge that illuminates the path of fired bullets so shooters can see whether their aim is correct ,0
Haig told the AP on Tuesday that he sold unspecified ammunition to Paddock ,0
"He also told """""""" CBS This Morning """""""" on Wednesday that he sold more than 700 rounds of ammunition to Paddock ",0
""""""""" I could n't detect anything wrong with this guy , """""""" he said of Paddock ",0
"The ammunition sale took place at Haig 's home in Mesa , because he did n't have all the ammunition on hand that Paddock wanted while at the gun show ",0
Victor said a box that Paddock used to carry ammunition out of Haig 's house and bore his client 's name was later found in the Las Vegas hotel where the attack was launched ,0
It 's unknown whether the ammunition Haig sold to Paddock was used in the attack ,0
The lawyer said the type and quantity of ammunition Paddock bought from his client was n't unusual ,0
"Robert Spitzer , an expert on firearms and the Second Amendment , said by and large there are no restrictions on the amount of ammunition a person can buy , but a large sale of tracer ammunition would certainly be unusual ",0
Only six states in the U.S. have laws requiring that ammunition buyers pass a background check ,0
"Arizona and Nevada do not have such a requirement , nor do they mandate that dealers keep a record of ammunition transactions ",0
""""""""" If you are in the business of selling anything , you are usually happy to make the sale , and there 's nothing that says you need to write down this person 's name or report the sale , """""""" said Spitzer , who is the chairman of political science at the State University of New York at Cortland ",0
"Victor said his client has cooperated with investigators who contacted him within 24 hours of the shooting and has spoken to them probably four or five times , though he has n't talked to them in months ",0
Haig describes himself as a senior engineer for Honeywell Aerospace in his biography on the professional and social media platform LinkedIn ,0

A rough patch — or a double - dip recession ? ,0
Economists are increasingly befuddled at what awaits the once - great U.S. economy ,1

Unemployment is a case in point ,0
It now seems obvious that one of those mysterious memos has gone out to the Main Stream Media saying that no - one can mention the immigration moratorium solution ,1
But unemployment is befuddling anyway ,0
"Just a few weeks ago professional prognosticators were expecting job growth of 175,000 in May. ",0
"However , nonfarm payroll growth came in at 54,000 in May , the smallest gain since September , and a fraction of the just lowered consensus forecast ( 125,000 jobs ",0
) ,0
"The """""""" other """""""" employment survey , of households rather than businesses , also broadcast mixed signals — at least so far as the prospects for native - born workers are concerned ",0
"VDARE.com has long argued that the household survey captures the employment of illegal aliens ; additionally , it actually mentions ethnicity ",0
"In May , according to the Household Survey , total employment rose by 105,000 ",0
Non - Hispanics actually gained ground : ,0
"Total employment : up 105,000 ( + 0.08 percent ) ",0
"Non - Hispanic employment : up 190,000 ( + 0.16 percent ) ",0
"Hispanic employment : down 85,000 ( -0.42 percent ) ",0

"Over that same period Hispanic employment rose by 3.9 million , up a whopping 24.2 % ",0
"Simply put , the 21st century has not been good for non - Hispanic job seekers ",1
"This Hispanic / non - Hispanic divide was , of course , a convenient proxy for VDARE.com 's primary interest : foreign - born workers and their role in displacing their native - born counterparts ",0
We tracked this by looking at Hispanics because such a high proportion of them are foreign - born — and because the federal government declined to provide data on immigrant vs. non - immigrant unemployment ,0

Pope Francis : Ross Douthat & Massimo Faggioli Debate Catholic Church ’s Future ,0
"Pope Francis visits Genoa , Italy , in May 2017 ",0
( Reuters photo : Giorgio Perottino ) ,0
"In a debate , Ross Douthat and Massimo Faggioli discussed Pope Francis ’s legacy and its effect on internal Church controversies ",0
"On Wednesday night , New York Times columnist Ross Douthat and Villanova professor of theology Massimo Faggioli came together for a debate entitled “ Francis @ Five : Assessing the Legacy of Pope Francis Five Years after His Election ",0
"” As I made my way up to Fordham University , I was excited ",0
"Having followed Douthat and Faggioli ’s ongoing dialogue on Twitter , I knew I was in for a lively , if predictable , conversation ",0
"In his opening remarks , Douthat laid out three criteria that can be used to evaluate Francis ’s papacy thus far : his impact on the public ’s perception of the Church ( a success ) ; his attempts at reforming the Vatican bureaucracy ( a disappointment ) ; and his position on “ moral - theological controversies , ” specifically , communion for the divorced and remarried ( a problem ) ",0
Advertisement ,0
Advertisement ,0
"Faggioli , meanwhile , outlined a genuinely surprising position ",1
"Rather than making a straightforward case for why Pope Francis has changed the Church for the better , Faggioli rejected the possibility of evaluating his papacy in terms of “ continuity ” with past popes , since doing so would assume that “ Christianity at some point ",0
"was complete , ” which Faggioli does not think is true ",0
"While I emphatically disagree with this argument , I have to hand it to Faggioli : From the outset , he made clear that he was not planning to debate Douthat on the implications of the Francis papacy ",0
"Instead , through a combination of rhetorical tricks and soft - peddled Hegelianism , he would completely redefine the role and nature of the Catholic Church ",1
During the crux of the debate — the discussion of communion for the divorced and remarried — Faggioli raised his most theologically unsettling point ,1
"To defend his position that remarried persons should be able to receive communion , Faggioli invoked the case of Germany , where 50 percent of Catholic marriages end in divorce ",0
"For Faggioli , the implication is that at least 50 percent of German Catholic children never see their parents receive communion and lose their faith because of it ",1
"This , he says , is “ bad for evangelization , ” and in order to keep the pews full , the Church ’s role should not be to deny communion to the divorced and remarried , but instead to ask , “ What can the Catholic Church do to make the faithful able to receive sacraments ? ” ",1
Advertisement ,0
"This is a lovely suggestion , and one that I ’m not entirely unsympathetic to ",1
"However , the fact remains that Faggioli is suggesting the Church do much more than provide sacraments to the faithful ",0
"Just before invoking the German case , Faggioli characterized the country as one of the most secular in the world ",0
"But rather than lamenting what secularism has wrought on marital life in Germany , reasserting the Church ’s position on marriage , and insisting that the faithful strive to live according to her laws , Faggioli argues that the Church ought to bend to the will of secular society ",0
Advertisement ,0
"It should be clear to anyone , not just practicing Catholics , that this is absurd ",0
"If the Church exists simply to accommodate the whims and failures of secular modernity , then what is the point of the Church ? ",0
"Pope Benedict XVI has warned against precisely the kind of “ accommodation ” Faggioli is calling for , writing that when “ the people can not cope ” with God , they “ bring him down into their own world , ” and insist that “ he must be the kind of God that [ they need ] ",0
"” In other words , “ Man is using God , and , in reality , even if it is not outwardly discernible , he is placing himself above God ",0
"” To fully drive the point home , Benedict equates this kind of worship with the Israelites desert worship of the bull calf ",0
"Unsurprisingly , this progressive interpretation of Catholic doctrine eventually reveals itself to be rank historicism ",1
"Throughout the debate , Faggioli drew out the argument that allowing the remarried to receive communion would not represent a radical change in doctrine but a return to the teachings of the Gospel ",0
"Eventually , Douthat drew his argument to its logical conclusion with this question : Were priests throughout history in fact misleading their divorced and remarried parishioners by telling them they could not receive communion ? ",1
"After a few seconds’ pause , Faggioli gave the only answer he could : “ There are different responses to the same question in different times ",1
” ,1
Advertisement ,0
"Throughout their conversation , both Douthat and Faggioli repeatedly observed that the debate over Pope Francis and the future of the Church is carried on primarily among Catholic intellectuals , unbeknownst to most of “ the flock ",0
” ,0
Advertisement ,0
"It strikes me , however , that everybody — Catholic or not — has a dog in this fight , which is about more than communion and canon law ",1
"At its core , this debate is about truth and our ability to judge right from wrong ",0
"Could we possibly say , for instance , that it ’s impossible to judge the presidency of Donald Trump relative to past presidents ? ",1

"For Garcia ’s Zarate ’s attorney , Matt Gonzalez , Ralph Nader ’s running mate in the 2008 presidential election , the trial was all about Donald Trump ",0
"“ For those who might criticize this verdict – there are a number of people who have commented on this case in the last couple of years , ” Gonzalez said after the verdict , “ the Attorney General of the United States and the President and Vice President of the United States ",0
"Let me just remind them , they are themselves under investigation by a special prosecutor in Washington D.C. and they may soon avail themselves of the presumption of innocence beyond a reasonable doubt , so I ask that they reflect on that before they comment or disparage the results of this case ",1

I believe today is a day of vindication for the rights of immigrants ,1

"Mexican national Jose Ines Garcia Zarate , 54 , is a seven - time felon and has been deported five times ",0
In 2015 federal authorities sought to detain him for deportation ,0
San Francisco Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi chose to defy the feds and release the Mexican national ,0
"On July 1 , 2015 , the criminal illegal picked up a Sig Sauer .40 caliber pistol , stolen from a Bureau of Land Management officer , and fired the shot that killed Kate Steinle , only 32 years old ",0
"The Mexican nation and career criminal enjoyed all the rights of the American legal system , the presumption of innocence , and a high - profile defense attorney funded by American taxpayers ",1
"During the trial , former vice presidential candidate Matt Gonzalez claimed that Garcia Zarate ’s background and nationality played a role in his prosecution ",1
"As Gonzalez argued , “ If this was a college student or Swedish kid would he be charged with murder ? ” ",1
"That sort of politically correct nonsense plays well in San Francisco , so any observer of the case could be forgiven for believing that prosecution and defense both got the outcome they wanted , regardless of the tragedy for the Steinle family ",1
"The felony firearms charge , the only charge on which Garcia Zarate was found guilty , carries a sentence of 16 months to 3 years ",0
"Since Garcia Zarate has been languishing in jail , the authorities could commute any sentence to time served and he could walk free within weeks ",0
San Francisco is not likely to hand the felon over to ICE for deportation ,0
"Should that happen , Garcia Zarate has already proved five times that anybody can get away with violating U.S. immigration law ",0
"He has already proved that in the sanctuary state of California , false - documented illegals are a privileged class ",1
"Jose Ines Garcia Zarate , or whatever his real name is , has also proved that a career criminal who is not even supposed to be in the country can literally get away with murder in broad daylight ",0

' Oumuamua : Space Cigar Is Still Spinning From Mysterious Violent Collision ,0

"A day after Florida ’s election left top state races too close to call , a Democratic party leader directed staffers and volunteers to share altered election forms with voters to fix signature problems on absentee ballots after the state ’s deadline ",0
"The altered forms surfaced in Broward , Santa Rosa , Citrus and Okaloosa counties and were reported to federal prosecutors to review for possible election fraud as Florida counties completed a required recount in three top races ",0
But an email obtained by the USA TODAY NETWORK – Florida shows that Florida Democrats were organizing a broader statewide effort beyond those counties to give voters the altered forms to fix improper absentee ballots after the Nov. 5 deadline ,0
"Democratic party leaders provided staffers with copies of a form , known as a “ cure affidavit , ” that had been modified to include an inaccurate Nov. 8 deadline ",0
"We also know that a Broward County employee , Chelsey Smith , signed an affidavit affirming that she had seen members of Snipes ' staff engaging in voter fraud ",0
"She ignored a court order , mixed invalid provisional ballots in with valid ones , and destroyed ballots , but do n't worry , a Democrat attorney says that doing so has nothing to do with fraud or corruption ",1
"Now that federal prosecutors have gotten involved , perhaps it 's time to quit talking about it and actually arrest this woman and charge her with crimes against the people of Broward County before more people end up dead in Broward County over their corrupt voting practices ",1

"“ Christian Parent Furious After School Instructs Children To Write Out Their Submission To Allah , ” by Joshua Gill , Daily Caller News Foundation , May 17 , 2018 ( thanks to the Geller Report ) : ",0
A West Virginia school has come under fire for instructing junior high students to write the Islamic profession of faith ostensibly to practice calligraphy ,1
"Rich Penkoski , a Christian parent and founder of online ministry Warriors for Christ , raised alarms over a packet on Islam his daughter ’s seventh grade social studies teacher issued to students , according to Christian Post ",1
"The packet , edited from the full version of a world religions workbook , instructed students to practice writing the Shahada , or Islamic profession of faith , in Arabic calligraphy — an assignment that , if left undone , would result in detention , according to Penkoski ’s daughter ",0
"The Shahada states : “ There is no god but Allah , and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah ",0
"” Penkoski called Mountain Ridge Middle School Principal Ron Branch and objected to the packet , saying it disturbed him and had misinformation about the history of calligraphy ",1
“ I saw the assignment of writing the Shahada in Arabic ,0
"Their excuse was calligraphy , ” Penkoski told The Christian Post ",0
"“ I was like , ‘ Whoa ! ",0
Whoa ! ,0
"Whoa!’ First of all , calligraphy was invented in China 3,000 years prior to Muhammad ",0
The fact that they were trying to get my daughter to write that disturbed me ,1
"” “ I said , ‘ That is not happening ",0
"My daughter is not doing that.’ My daughter told me that if she did n’t do the assignment , then she was going to get a [ detention ] slip , ” Penkoski added … ",0
"There were two different calligraphy assignments — one involving the Shahada and another instructing students to practice writing English letters in calligraphy , Branch told Christian Post ",0
"Hinson “ told the students that they could do these activities if they wanted , ” Branch claimed ",0
“ The teacher has told her class several times that this is a study of world religions and that she is not trying to advocate for any religion over another ,0
"She has told her class that if they had questions about religious beliefs , that those conversations should take place with their parents , ” Branch added ",0
"Penkoski claimed the teacher sent students home with the same packet the day after he lodged a complaint — this time , with certain sections crossed out but still including the Shahada assignment ",0
Penkoksi called the principal again and confronted Hinson over the phone ,0
"“ I said , ‘ This is not OK in asking my kid to write down the Shahada.’ The teacher happened to walk - in and said she made it an option and that the kids did n’t have to do it ",0
"My daughter conflicted that story and said , ‘ No , that is not what was said.’ What was said was , ‘ Do the assignment ; and if you want to learn more about the Quran , ask your parents,’ ” Penkoski told Christian Post ",0
"Each religion studied in the class , including Christianity and Judaism , received “ equitable treatment , ” Branch also told Christian Post ",0
"He said the class spent a week and a half on Christianity and Judaism — other religions took one week — and discussed each religion ’s beliefs , history and practices ",0
"During the section on Christianity , “ Jesus was taught , ” Branch claimed ",0
"“ The students read the chapter in our textbook that discusses Christianity ’s belief that Jesus is the Son of God , and salvation ",0
"They also discussed the Sermon on the Mount , the Last Supper and Jesus’ Betrayal , the Trinity , and the Lord ’s Prayer , among other topics , ” Branch said ",0
"Penkoski and his daughter , Brielle , contested Branch ’s claims ",0
"The Lord ’s Prayer was not taught , and very little time was spent teaching about Jesus , they told Christian Post ",0
“ We did [ the unit on Christianity ] over a week and two days ,0
We watched two different videos ,0
We did n’t finish them ,0
"They taught a little bit about Moses and the Ten Commandments , Peter and Paul , ” Brielle explained ",0
“ We learned about the Israelites and how they are being persecuted by the Romans ,0
We were told about the Jews and told a little bit about Jesus ,0
” Penkoski also shared with Christian Post the packets on Christianity and Judaism passed out in class and allegedly modified from the original full version ,0
"While the packet on Islam contained verses from the Koran , the packets for those religions did not contain scripture and did not encourage students to write prayers or faith statements , he said ",0
"“ Notice no Bible verses , no reciting the Ten Commandments or the Lord ’s Prayer , ” he said ",0
"“ [ There ’s ] no practicing writing in Hebrew as compared to the Islamic packet , ” he added … ",0

"Unfortunately , it is clear that Giuliani never really understood what I was trying to tell him ",0
"Like the rest of the neocons , he either does n’t get it or does n’t want to get it ",0
In a recent speech to the MeK – a violent Islamist - Marxist cult that spent two decades on the US terror watch list – Giuliani promised that the Trump Administration had made “ regime change ” a priority for Iran ,1
He even told the members of that organization – an organization that has killed dozens of Americans – that Trump would put them in charge of Iran ! ,1
Giuliani shares with numerous other neocons like John Bolton a strong relationship with this group ,0

It ’s easy to dismiss the bombastic Giuliani as he speaks to his financial benefactors in the MeK. ,0
"Unfortunately , however , Giuliani ’s claims were confirmed late last week , when the Washington Free Beacon published a three - page policy paper being circulated among National Security Council officials containing plans to spark regime change in Iran ",0
The paper suggests that the US focus on Iran ’s many ethnic minority groups to spark unrest and an eventual overthrow of the government ,0
"This is virtually the same road map that the US has followed in Iraq , Libya , Syria , and so on ",0
The results have been unmitigated disaster after disaster ,1
Unleashing terrorists on Iran to overthrow its government is not only illegal and immoral : it ’s also incredibly stupid ,1
"We know from 9/11 that blowback is real , even if Giuliani and the neocons refuse to understand it ",0
Iran does not threaten the United States ,0
"Unlike Washington ’s Arab allies in the region , Iran actually holds reasonably democratic elections and has a Western - oriented , educated , and very young population ",0
Why not open up to Iran with massive amounts of trade and other contacts ? ,0
Does anyone ( except for the neocons ) really believe it is better to unleash terrorists on a population than to engage them in trade and travel ? ,0

An Arizona man who sold ammunition to the gunman in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history has been charged with manufacturing armor - piercing bullets ,1
A complaint says unfired armor - piercing bullets found inside the Las Vegas hotel room where the attack was launched on Oct. 1 contained the fingerprints of ammunition dealer Douglas Haig of Arizona ,0
The complaint filed Friday in federal court in Phoenix says Haig did n't have a license to manufacture armor - piercing ammunition ,0
He was charged shortly before holding a news conference Friday ,0
He said he noticed nothing suspicious when he sold 720 rounds of ammunition to Stephen Paddock in the weeks before the attack that killed 58 people ,0
Haig is a 55-year - old aerospace engineer who sold ammunition as a hobby for about 25 years ,0
First American Citizen To Be Convicted Of Joining ISIS Gets 20 Years ,0
The first American citizen to be convicted of successfully joining the Islamic State has been sentenced to 20 years in prison ,0
"Mohamad Khweis , unlike the dozens of other people in the United States who failed to join ISIS and were subsequently charged , actually made it to Syria , but after just three months tried to escape and was captured by Kurdish forces , The Washington Post reports ",0
Khweis is an interesting case for numerous reasons ,0
"First , there was no particular event or friend who ignited his radicalization ",0
"Second , he successfully made it to Syria via Turkey ",0
"And third , he came from a secular home that was stable ",0
His life before joining the caliphate was unremarkable ,0
"He obtained an associate ’s degree in criminal justice and worked as a bus driver in Alexandria , Va. ",0
He also abused marijuana over the past few years ,0
Khweis’ defense attorney said Friday that even he has no idea what caused Khweis to join ISIS ,0
"“ It ’s difficult to understand , ” defense attorney John Zwerling said Friday ",0
“ We do n’t really know what caused him to travel to Syria ,0
” ,0
"From the very start of his trial , Khweis said he regretted his actions and said his decision to join ISIS in December 2015 was a drunken one ",1
"“ I hated myself for making the worst decision I ever made , ” Khweis wrote to the judge in a letter ",0
“ I ruined my life and my family ’s life ,1

Army Colonel : False Flag ‘ Gulf of Tonkin Incident’ May Be Used to Get US Into War with Iran ,0
"Often , the American mainstream media becomes a de facto government employee , taking the claims of U.S. officials and reporting them as proven fact — and nothing exemplifies this penchant better than reporting on the Gulf of Tonkin incident — perhaps one of most flagrant lies ever dreamed up as a justification for war ",1
"On August 5 , 1964 , the New York Times reported , “ President Johnson has ordered retaliatory action against gunboats and ‘ certain supporting facilities in North Vietnam’ after renewed attacks against American destroyers in the Gulf of Tonkin ",0
"” Additional outlets , such as the Washington Post , echoed this claim ",0
But it was n’t true ,0
At all ,1
"In fact , the Gulf of Tonkin incident , as it became known , turned out to be a fictitious creation courtesy of the government to escalate war in Vietnam — leading to the deaths of tens of thousands of U.S. troops and millions of Vietnamese , fomenting the largest anti - war movement in American history , and tarnishing the reputation of a nation once considered at least somewhat noble in the eyes of the world ",0

"In 2010 , more than 1,100 transcripts from the Vietnam era were released , proving Congress and officials raised serious doubts about the information fed to them by the Pentagon and White House ",0
"But while this internal grumbling took place , mainstream media dutifully reported official statements as if the veracity of the information could n’t be disputed ",0
"Tom Wells , author of the exhaustive exposé “ The War Within : America ’s Battle Over Vietnam , ” explained the media egregiously erred in “ almost exclusive reliance on U.S. government officials as sources of information ” and “ reluctance to question official pronouncements on ‘ national security issues.’ ” ",0
"If due diligence had been performed , and reporters had raised appropriate doubts about the Gulf of Tonkin false flag , it ’s arguable whether support for the contentious war would have lasted as long as it did ",0

MEK is the Iranian political - militant organization that advocates for the violent overthrow of the current Iranian regime ,0
They are hardly quiet about it ,0
"According to Hersh , MEK members were trained in intercepting communications , cryptography , weaponry and small unit tactics at the Nevada site until President Barack Obama took office in 2009 ",0

"While the current Iranian regime is certainly no bastion of freedom , the idea that US intervention or a violent revolution would be beneficial for the people of Iran is outright insane ",1
"To see what US intervention — through military support and the support of ‘ protesters’—does to countries , one need only look at Syria , Iraq , Afghanistan , and Libya to see the horrific death tolls and war - ravaged dystopias left in America ’s wake ",1

FBI Ca n’t Find Motive of Muslim Who Drove Burning Minivan Onto Travis Air Force Base ,0
"“ Motive a mystery in car explosion at Travis Air Force Base ” was the Los Angeles Times headline , and this one is indeed a real mystery ",0
"A Muslim named Hafiz Kazi , according to the Times , “ drove a burning minivan filled with propane and gas tanks into the front gate of Travis Air Force Base in Northern California ",0
"” After scrutinizing all the evidence closely , the FBI just ca n’t figure out what could possibly have been Kazi ’s motive ",0
And that in a nutshell shows what ’s wrong with today ’s FBI ,0
"Sean Ragan , FBI special agent in charge of the Sacramento field office , stated : “ We do n’t have any nexus of terrorism at this point ",0
"Now the question is , why ",0
Why was he there ? ,0
What led him there ? ,0
"And we do n’t know answers to that , quite frankly ",0
” ,0
"The Times noted that when emergency responders approached the burning van after it crashed , “ they found five propane tanks , three plastic one - gallon gas cans , several lighters , three phones and a gym bag with personal items , Ragan said ",0
” ,0
"Yes , what Kazi could possibly have been up to is a complete mystery ",0
"The Times added that “ the dead man ’s religious beliefs and affiliation are not known at this point , said Ragan , who debunked a rumor that some sort of ‘ jihad’ video was found on Kazi ’s phone ",0
” ,0
All right ,0
No jihad video ,0
"And no “ nexus of terrorism , ” according to Sean Ragan ",0
What is a nexus of terrorism ? ,0
"Ragan most likely means that investigators did n’t find an ISIS membership card in Kazi ’s wallet , or lots of phone calls to Iraq or Syria , or a note from Kazi reading , “ I did this for Allah and Islam ",1
Allahu akbar ,1
” ,0
"Of course , even if they had found those things , given the FBI ’s recent track record of denial and deception , they may still be searching for Kazi ’s motive ",0
"In any case , a larger point is being lost here ",0
And that is that there is a war going on ,0
"We know that the Islamic State , al - Qaeda and other groups have called upon Muslims in the U.S. to try to kill military personnel and police , as well as civilians ",1
"We know that Kazi , with all the propane and gas tanks in his car , was clearly trying to set off a major fire that would kill more people than just himself ",0
"Even if he was n’t on the phone to Baghdadi , the likelihood is that when a Muslim drives into a U.S. Air Force Base with a car full of incendiaries , probably this has something to do with the global jihad ",0
"The FBI ’s bafflement here is part of its deep , deep corruption ",1
"The FBI does n’t acknowledge that there is a global jihad , or that Islam has anything to do with terrorism ",1
"It does n’t admit that there is a war going on , and treats each act of Islamic terror as if it were a separate and discrete criminal event , unrelated to all the others ",1
"So each time something like this happens , they ’re back at Square One , trying to figure out motive ",1
"It ’s as if the U.S. Army stopped to interrogate every German soldier who crashed through the Ardennes Forest at the beginning of the Battle of the Bulge in 1944 , to see if each one ’s actions had anything to do with the German Army and Adolf Hitler ’s war aims ",1
Authorities are also investigating whether or not Kazi was suffering from any mental health issues ,0
"Here again , this is just more of the general refusal to acknowledge the 800-pound gorilla sitting in the living room and screaming “ Allahu akbar ",1
"” Sean Ragan might explain to us that authorities are also trying to determine whether the German invasion of Poland in September 1939 was motivated by Nazism , or by mental health issues among the German High Command ",1
This willful ignorance leads to a diversion and waste of resources that is astronomical and catastrophic ,1
How long is this comic opera going to continue ? ,0
"If the jihadis advance even into the FBI ’s Sacramento offices , will agents there be struggling to determine the jihadis’ motive even as the machete begins to slice through their necks ? ",1

The woman ’s lifeless body can be seen being drug across the parking lot by several men who placed the body behind a pick - up truck while the gunfire continued ,0
"The event was reported by Intellihub ’s Shepard Ambellas on Nov. 11 , 2017 , in the article titled Private surveillance footage reveals “ helicopter hovering overhead ” at time of Las Vegas Massacre , FBI never asked for tape , after an excerpt of the footage aired on Tucker Carlson Tonight ",0
"At 10:16 p.m. , two men drag a “ fallen victim ” across the parking lot ",0
"The men position the victim behind a Ford pickup truck , presumably to shield themselves and the victim from taking any further incoming rounds as they attempted to give the victim medical assistance ",0
"“ Later at ten - twenty - four p.m. , one of the men places his shirt across the victim ’s face and then at ten - thirty - two a man places what appears to be a blanket or towel over the body after they had given up hope , ” Tucker Carlson said ",0
“ Police only arrive in this area for the first time around ten - forty - five p.m. when the body is still there ,0
” The victim ’s body was eventually was loaded into the back of a Ford Raptor pickup truck at 11:50 p.m. and taken away ,0
"Astonishingly , between the times of 10:13 p.m. and 10:16 p.m. a good amount of debris can be seen being pushed downward and sideways in front of the camera which Carlson claims is from a “ helicopter hovering overhead ",0
"” A quick review of flight records during that time reveals that a squadron of EC-130 Eurocopters departed from Maverick Leasing LLC at 10:12 p.m. , several of which appear to have overflown the parking lot where the victim and debris were seen ",0
"However , the departure of the choppers and the fact that several of them overflew the parking lot does not explain all of the debris being kicked up from by a heavy downdraft , prop wash , possibly from a helicopter hovering in place much closer ",0
"In fact , the downdraft appears to be constant from 10:13 - 10:16 p.m. and not intermittent as if several choppers had just passed overhead ",0
"According to Carlson , the owner of the tape maintains that law enforcement investigators have never asked to see the footage ",1

"Viganò Doubles Down , Accuses Francis of Losing Sight of Christ ",0
"Archbishop Viganò has released a new , powerful statement necessitated by the peculiar reaction of Pope Francis to the Aug 22 Testimony ",0
"Many thanks to our friends at LifeSiteNews , especially Diane Montagna , for the following translation and release of the follow - up testimony from arguably the most courageous prelate in the Church today — Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò ",1
"The former Apostolic Nuncio to the United States has , as they say , doubled down ",0
"Far from backing - away and making excuses for his early actions , as we ’ve all become so accustomed to seeing in these rare cases where a hierarch breaks ranks , Archbishop Viganò is digging in with a 4-page bombshell that restates his initial accusations of abuse cover - up against Francis and other powerful members of the hierarchy , and even concludes with a suggestion that Francis is beginning to act as a “ substitute of our Lord ",1
” ,0
Read the Archbishop ’s words for yourselves and note well the ring of truth that resonates in every sentence ,0
This is clearly the testimony of an honest man who has only the good of the Church in his heart — a modern - day Athanasius standing against something so much worse than Liberius ,1
"Friends , let us pray for Archbishop Viganò ",0
"He is standing alone now , and not only against the most dangerous pontificate in history , but also the forces of hell itself — forces which will do all in their power to silence this voice crying in the wilderness ",1
Make no mistake about this : Archbishop Viganò is fighting for the very survival of the human element of the Catholic Church ,1
"He is standing against corrupt men in high places who can not be trusted to do what is best for souls , for the Catholic faithful or indeed for Holy Mother Church herself ",0
The enemy is not only at the gates but has now made their way to the thrones of power and the seats of the Apostles ,1
God help us ,1
"It goes without saying that we here at The Remnant not only stand with Viganò but we thank God for him every day , we pray the Rosary for him every day , and wish him every blessing and heavenly consolation as he undergoes this passion for the sake of the Master he serves so well ",1

"It has been a month since I offered my testimony , solely for the good of the Church , regarding what occurred at the audience with Pope Francis on June 23 , 2013 and regarding certain matters I was given to know in the assignments entrusted to me at the Secretariat of State and in Washington , in relation to those who bear responsibility for covering up the crimes committed by the former archbishop of that capital ",0
My decision to reveal those grave facts was for me the most painful and serious decision that I have ever made in my life ,1
"I made it after long reflection and prayer , during months of profound suffering and anguish , during a crescendo of continual news of terrible events , with thousands of innocent victims destroyed and the vocations and lives of young priests and religious disturbed ",1
"The silence of the pastors who could have provided a remedy and prevented new victims became increasingly indefensible , a devastating crime for the Church ",1
"Well aware of the enormous consequences that my testimony could have , because what I was about to reveal involved the successor of Peter himself , I nonetheless chose to speak in order to protect the Church , and I declare with a clear conscience before God that my testimony is true ",0
"Christ died for the Church , and Peter , Servus servorum Dei , is the first one called to serve the spouse of Christ ",0
"Certainly , some of the facts that I was to reveal were covered by the pontifical secret that I had promised to observe and that I had faithfully observed from the beginning of my service to the Holy See ",0
"But the purpose of any secret , including the pontifical secret , is to protect the Church from her enemies , not to cover up and become complicit in crimes committed by some of her members ",0
"I was a witness , not by my choice , of shocking facts and , as the Catechism of the Catholic Church states ( par ",1
"2491 ) , the seal of secrecy is not binding when very grave harm can be avoided only by divulging the truth ",0
Only the seal of confession could have justified my silence ,0
"Neither the pope , nor any of the cardinals in Rome have denied the facts I asserted in my testimony ",0
"“ Qui tacet consentit ” surely applies here , for if they deny my testimony , they have only to say so , and provide documentation to support that denial ",0
How can one avoid concluding that the reason they do not provide the documentation is that they know it confirms my testimony ? ,1
"The center of my testimony was that since at least June 23 , 2013 , the pope knew from me how perverse and evil McCarrick was in his intentions and actions , and instead of taking the measures that every good pastor would have taken , the pope made McCarrick one of his principal agents in governing the Church , in regard to the United States , the Curia , and even China , as we are seeing these days with great concern and anxiety for that martyr Church ",1
"Now , the pope ’s reply to my testimony was : “ I will not say a word ! ” But then , contradicting himself , he has compared his silence to that of Jesus in Nazareth and before Pilate , and compared me to the great accuser , Satan , who sows scandal and division in the Church — though without ever uttering my name ",1
"If he had said : “ Viganò lied , ” he would have challenged my credibility while trying to affirm his own ",0
In so doing he would have intensified the demand of the people of God and the world for the documentation needed to determine who has told the truth ,0
"Instead , he put in place a subtle slander against me — slander being an offense he has often compared to the gravity of murder ",0
"Indeed , he did it repeatedly , in the context of the celebration of the most Holy Sacrament , the Eucharist , where he runs no risk of being challenged by journalists ",0
"When he did speak to journalists , he asked them to exercise their professional maturity and draw their own conclusions ",0
But how can journalists discover and know the truth if those directly involved with a matter refuse to answer any questions or to release any documents ? ,1
The pope ’s unwillingness to respond to my charges and his deafness to the appeals by the faithful for accountability are hardly consistent with his calls for transparency and bridge building ,1
"Moreover , the pope ’s cover - up of McCarrick was clearly not an isolated mistake ",0
"Many more instances have recently been documented in the press , showing that Pope Francis has defended homosexual clergy who committed serious sexual abuses against minors or adults ",1
These include his role in the case of Fr ,0
"Julio Grassi in Buenos Aires , his reinstatement of Fr ",0
"Mauro Inzoli after Pope Benedict had removed him from ministry ( until he went to prison , at which point Pope Francis laicized him ) , and his halting of the investigation of sex abuse allegations against Cardinal Cormac Murphy O’Connor ",0
"In the meantime , a delegation of the USCCB , headed by its president Cardinal DiNardo , went to Rome asking for a Vatican investigation into McCarrick ",0
Cardinal DiNardo and the other prelates should tell the Church in America and in the world : did the pope refuse to carry out a Vatican investigation into McCarrick ’s crimes and of those responsible for covering them up ? ,1
The faithful deserve to know ,1
"I would like to make a special appeal to Cardinal Ouellet , because as nuncio I always worked in great harmony with him , and I have always had great esteem and affection towards him ",0
"He will remember when , at the end of my mission in Washington , he received me at his apartment in Rome in the evening for a long conversation ",0
"At the beginning of Pope Francis’ pontificate , he had maintained his dignity , as he had shown with courage when he was Archbishop of Québec ",0
"Later , however , when his work as prefect of the Congregation for Bishops was being undermined because recommendations for episcopal appointments were being passed directly to Pope Francis by two homosexual “ friends ” of his dicastery , bypassing the Cardinal , he gave up ",1
"His long article in L’Osservatore Romano , in which he came out in favor of the more controversial aspects of Amoris Laetitia , represents his surrender ",1
"Your Eminence , before I left for Washington , you were the one who told me of Pope Benedict ’s sanctions on McCarrick ",0
You have at your complete disposal key documents incriminating McCarrick and many in the curia for their cover - ups ,0
"Your Eminence , I urge you to bear witness to the truth ",0
"Finally , I wish to encourage you , dear faithful , my brothers and sisters in Christ : never be despondent ! ",1
"Make your own the act of faith and complete confidence in Christ Jesus , our Savior , of Saint Paul in his second Letter to Timothy , Scio cui credidi , which I choose as my episcopal motto ",1
"This is a time of repentance , of conversion , of prayers , of grace , to prepare the Church , the bride of the Lamb , ready to fight and win with Mary the battle against the old dragon ",1

A watchdog group filed a Senate ethics complaint Monday against Sens ,0
Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren for sending out fundraising emails asking for donations to support their votes against Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh — even before they cast their votes against him ,0
"While voting and then asking supporters to back that decision with cash is common , the watchdog group , the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust ( FACT ) , says asking for money ahead of time crosses the line into vote - buying ",0
"FACT asked the Senate ethics committee to probe fundraising emails sent by Ms. Warren , Massachusetts Democrat , and Ms. Harris , California Democrat ",0
"Ms. Warren ’s email said she was demanding a delay on the judge ’s confirmation vote and asked for donations for her 2018 election campaign , while Ms. Harris ’s emails detailed several of her actions as a member of the Judiciary Committee , including her questioning of the president ’s pick for the high court , and asking for contributions ",0
"The Senate 's own rules prohibit this kind of behavior , but will the Senate hold these women to the standard they 've set ? ",1
"“ This is a clear violation of the Senate Ethics rules which safeguard against the appearance or actuality of elected officials ‘ cashing in’ on their official position for political purposes , ” said Kendra Arnold , executive director of FACT ",1
"Of course , but like most of these kinds of violations , the only thing that might actually occur here is censure , and that is highly unlikely in the current climate ",0
"However , voters should be aware of the unethical practice of both of these senators ",0
"While Harris is not up for re - election this year , Warren is ",0

"Dom Paul Delatte , OSB , Abbot of Solesmes ",0
Today I received an email from a monastery of cloistered Carmelite nuns about the new document from the Vatican ’s Congregation for Religious ,0
"They ’re helping me examine this document , having kindly volunteered to serve as consultants , to help me understand it from an inside position ",0
"These , I might add , are not what we would consider a “ traditionalist ” community ",0
They have only the Novus Ordo Mass and use the new rite Divine Office in their native vernacular language ,0
"For obvious reasons I ca n’t identify them , even to say what country they are in ",0
"Writing to me in English , by way of introductory comments in their longer analysis of the document that will be forthcoming , Sister T , fully professed and a senior member of the monastery ’s council , said , “ The Cor Orans document is the death - knell of Carmel ",1
It signals the end of the contemplative monastic life ,0
"Not only does it destroy the autonomy of the Monasteries , something Our Holy Mother St. Teresa was extremely insistent about , but it also removes the Superior , dissolves her authority and power , removes the financial independence of each Monastery , and destroys the specificity of each charism ",1
“ This is a disaster ,1
Especially for Carmel ,0
” ,0
"I contrast this frightening comment with those coming from the man immediately responsible for “ Cor orans , ” Cardinal João Braz de Aviz , the Brazilian prefect of the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life in a speech to religious formation directors in 2015 , in which he laid out pretty clearly what was coming in this piece of legislation , 3 years later ",1
"In fact , as the National Catholic Reporter piece said , the meeting itself was “ unprecedented , ” 1200 formators of religious life gathered by the Congregation for Religious in order to hear the new marching orders ",0
This is the programme : ,0
“ Do not distance yourself from the great lines of the Second Vatican Council ,0
"” “ In fact , those that are distancing themselves from the council to make another path are killing themselves – sooner or later , they will die ",1
They will not have sense ,0
They will be outside the church ,1
"We need to build , using the Gospel and the Council as a departure point ",0
” ,0
"After breathing this threat , the cardinal continued , saying that because modern people ’s “ needs ” are fundamentally different from what they were in the past , there was no reason to stick too closely to what the founders and foundresses – people like St. Anthony , St. Augustine , St. John Cassian , St. Benedict , St. Bruno , St. Dominic , Sts ",0
"Francis and Clare , Sts ",0
Teresa of Avila and John of the Cross - wanted ,0
“ These contexts have changed ,0
"And the council reminds us that consecrated life must be Christian discipleship ... must be discipleship of the founders that we remember , but also must be open to the culture of the present moment ",0
” ,0
“ We must not be closed to new things ,0
"God is not static , ” the cardinal said ",0
"“ God is always new movement – of light , of heat , of demonstration ",0
He speaks in every time to men and women with the true language of that time ,0
” ,0
"The congregation ’s Secretary , Archbishop José Rodríguez Carballo , is reported as saying , “ With this explicit reference to the Second Vatican Council , we point to our profound conviction that the council is the point of reference , non - negotiable , in the formation to the consecrated life ",0
” ,0
"Not the charism of the order , nor the rule , nor the Patristic tradition , nor the Doctors , nor the mystics , nor any of the 2000-year - old tradition of religious life , from the Desert Fathers to the giants of the Tridentine period ; just Vatican II ",0
"And only , apparently , a single “ interpretation ” of it , if we are to judge by the soap and oil Braz de Aviz poured on the ruffled feathers of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious – the most virulently anti - Catholic organisation of “ Catholic ” religious in the world – and by his vicious persecution of the Franciscans of the Immaculate ",1
"Carballo continues his remarks , giving us a clue as to his feelings towards strictly cloistered , contemplative religious life : “ A consecrated life , a life in God but inserted in the ecclesial family , in the church – inserted in the world ",0
"Not in conflict with the world , but inserted in continuity , ” he said ",0
"It is to wonder what this man would make of a comment by the great Dom Paul Delatte , the second abbot of Solesmes and successor to the refounder , Dom Gueranger , who wrote in his commentary on the Rule of St. Benedict : ",0
"“ The Prologue set this choice before us , the world or Our Lord , as mutually exclusive alternatives ; we can not remain neutral , but must belong wholly to the one or wholly to the other ",1
” ,0
"“ After entering into Christ by baptism and by the monastic profession , we should hold ourselves as far aloof from the world as possible and have no connection with it ",0
There shall no longer be more intercourse between us than there is between two corpses : ‘ The world is crucified to me and I to the world.’ ,0
"“ Let us be on our guard against thinking that it may sometimes be proper to soften the differences , to lessen the distance which separates us ",0
"The Apostle warns us that we can only please God by preserving the integrity of our true life : ‘ No man being a soldier to God , entangleth himself with secular businesses : that he may please him to whom he hath engaged himself.’ The world itself is scandalised by our condescending to it , and the words of the Imitation [ of Christ ] are always fulfilled : ‘ Sometimes we think to please others by our company ; whereas we begin rather to be displeasing to them by reason of the bad qualities they discover in us.’ ” ",0
How Cor orans will end St. Teresa of Avila ’s reform of Carmel ,0
"Sister T. continued , saying that the document explicitly derogates the founding intentions of St. Teresa for whom real autonomy was a crucial element of her Carmelite reform ",0
She acknowledges that cloistered orders of nuns have for some time been gathered into federations ,0
"These are already doing the Cor orans programme , having shared initial formation programmes for postulants and novices , “ ongoing formation ” courses for professed nuns , a federal abbess or president who oversees all the federated monasteries ",0
Their funds are already interconnected and they have regular meetings with and input from the male branches ,0
"In 2015 , Carmelite monasteries received a questionnaire from the Father General Fr ",0
"Saverio Cannistra , a Mexican and devotee of Liberation Theology , to ask if they wanted an International Commission of Nuns to oversee the female houses place of the Carmelite Fathers ",0
"This suggestion was rejected , to the annoyance of Maccise ",0
"Maccise also promoted the idea of having no superiors in the individual monasteries , but only federation presidents and shared formation of novices ",0
"The push for these changes is still on , however , under the current General , an Italian , Saverio Cannistrà ",0
"Given the Marxist leanings of the recent crop of Fathers General , it seems clear that what can be expected by “ ongoing formation ” is , in essence , some form of political indoctrination , sprayed over with a micro - thin layer of pious language ",0
"But for Carmelite nuns , Sister said , these ideas are the antithesis of the intentions of St. Teresa ",0
"Authentic autonomy , independence of formation and finances , “ are essential points of our charism that Our Holy Mother established and to do away with them is to do away with the charism ",0
” ,0
"“ They go against our Constitutions , even though Cor Orans states that everything is to be done in accord with the charism and Constitutions ",0
"Each Carmel has its own spirit , its own tempo , it ’s own ‘ feel.’ Each nun is called not just to the Order , but to a specific Carmel ",0
Formation in common is something we ’ve been fighting against for years ,0
” ,0
"“ To have a federal president who can decide to take the novices away , or take all our finances , or tell the Holy See we ’re no longer ‘ viable’ – this is a disaster ",1
St. Teresa specifically set up the monasteries so that none of this would take place ,0
And now it ’s going to be done to us ,0
” ,0
"She points to the extended length of formation for new nuns - previously six years for Carmelites and under Cor orans now nine years , as absurd , saying it will tend to impede new vocations ",1
“ As though the Church is going to ask laypeople to be engaged for nine years before they marry ,0
"Our Constitutions already provide a three year extension of temporary vows if needed , but to make it mandatory will dissuade women from entering ",0
"It will also help the monastery become ‘ less viable’ because by the time anyone younger is professed , the others will be dead ",0
” ,0
"Another requirement will be for a “ religious assistant , ” a priest monitoring the monastery in addition to a chaplain , to be assigned by the federation ",0
Sister writes that this was rejected “ years ago ” by Carmelite monasteries as undue interference ,0
The religious assistant will have unprecedented powers ,1
"Article 23 states , for instance , “ In discerning the foundation of a new monastery on the part of a single monastery , the Federal President and the religious assistant intervene to help the superior of the founding monastery ",0
The discernment on the foundation of a new monastery by the Federation is made within the framework of the Federal Assembly ,0
” ,0
“ One other thing that is very striking to me is the complete loss of our rights ,1
"There are no options in this document , no choices , no recourse ",0
It ’s all being done to us ,0
"In this day and age , when Pope Francis is proclaiming , if not Liberty , Equality , and Fraternity , then at least license and ‘ choice’ for all , plus the ‘ rights’ of women , here our rights are completely taken away ",0
” ,0
Another nun has written saying that they can not conceive of what these people mean by “ ongoing formation ” ,0
"Judging from other documents from already - federated Carmelites in Europe , it means in practical terms going in groups away from the monastery for days or weeks at a time to take “ courses ” together with novices from other monasteries ",0
"The content of these course , of course , is to be formulated by teams of “ experts ” chosen by the Federation ",0
"Sister writes , “ Cloistered nuns have a very full horarium that does not allow for a lot of other things ",0
We already have to deal with the million unexpected things that come up each day ,1
I have no idea how we are going to implement all these ridiculous plans of ‘ on - going formation’ ,1
Can they not comprehend that simply faithfully living our daily life provides plenty of on - going formation ,0
” ,0
Apparently not ,0
"As I wrote in my first analysis piece , the document itself – that we must remember is a piece of legislation , a legal document laying out what all monasteries of contemplative nuns must now do – starts by laying out its working premise : ",0
"Pope Francis , in the wake of the teaching of Pope Pius XII and reaffirmed by Ecumenical Vatican Council II , intended to present in Vultum Dei quaerere the intense and fruitful path taken by the Church in the last decades , in the light of the teachings of the same Council and considering the changed socio - cultural conditions ",0
"In other words , it is the “ intense and fruitful path ” of the last few decades of the Church since Vatican II that all monasteries of cloistered , contemplative nuns must now take ",1
"Anyone who imagines that this document ’s authors will allow leeway , that there will be dispensations forthcoming for traditional or “ conservative ” communities from timid and cowed Vatican bodies like Ecclesia Dei , has failed to pay attention ",0
"In the last 20 years , “ conservative ” Catholics have pointed to the flourishing – mainly in the US – of some groups of sisters who had turned away from the “ intense and fruitful path ” and re - established some of the traditional accoutrements of the religious life ",1
"They point to the Nashville Dominicans , the Missionaries of Charity , the Poor Clares of Alabama , where there are at least habits , ( some ) chant , common life and common apostolates ",0
"But it is these signs of refusal of the programme that have infuriated the despots of the New Paradigm who would not rest until every last individual house of religious life was co - opted , subverted to the new ideology ",1

New Las Vegas Shooter Theory : “ Rushed And Unprepared … Could Have Led To Accident Like Shooting Himself In The Head ” ,0
It should be clear by now that the entire official narrative surrounding the Las Vegas shooting that left 59 people dead and hundreds injured is falling apart ,0
"From shooter Paddock ’s check - in date and the existence of a second person in his room , to possible connections to a terrorist organization , as well as the the actual timeline of events , everything being disseminated by law enforcement and the mainstream media should now come under public scrutiny ",0
In the last 24 hours the Sheriff ’s Department has significantly revised the event timeline and a key incident involving the shooting of a Mandalay Bay security guard ,0
"Originally , as highlighted by The Daily Sheeple , the security guard was hailed as being responsible for preventing the shooter from continuing his massacre because he interrupted him in the middle of the attack ",0
"As it turns out , security guard Jesus Campos was actually shot BEFORE Paddock opened fire on the concert crowd below his 32nd floor hotel suite ",0
"As part of the constantly changing story , officials are now saying that police officers who rushed to the hotel room when the shooting began did n’t know a hotel security guard had been shot “ until they met him in the hallway after exiting the elevator , ” Lombardo said ",1
"The security guard , Jesus Campos , was struck in the leg as the gunman , from behind his door , shot into the hallway on the 32nd floor ",0
"Paddock apparently detected Campos via surveillance cameras he set up outside his hotel suite , police have said ",0
"Paddock shot the guard at 9:59 p.m. local time , Lombardo said , shortly before raining down bullets on the Route 91 Harvest festival in an attack that began at 10:05 p.m. and lasted 10 minutes ",0
Police officers found Campos when they arrived on the floor ,0
"And Campos did not summon police to the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel , according to the timeline recently updated by the authorities ",0

"According to a person familiar with the matter , the FBI does not now plan to launch a criminal investigation of the matter , which would normally be handled by local authorities , if it was within the statute of limitations ",0
"The FBI instead passed the material to the White House , as an update to Kavanaugh 's background check , which already had been completed , the person said ",0
The move is similar to what the bureau did when allegations were leveled against former White House aide Rob Porter ,0

The Washington Free Beacon reports : ,0
"The Trump administration is examining a new plan to help Iranians fighting the hardline regime in Iran following America 's exit from the landmark nuclear deal and reimposition of harsh economic sanctions that could topple a regime already beset by protests and a crashing economy , according to a copy of the plan obtained by the Washington Free Beacon ",0
The three - page white paper being circulated among National Security Council officials in the White House offers a strategy by which the Trump administration can actively work to assist an already aggravated Iranian public topple the hardline ruling regime through a democratization strategy that focuses on driving a deeper wedge between the Iranian people and the ruling regime ,0
"The plan , authored by the Security Studies Group , or SSG , a national security think - tank that has close ties to senior White House national security officials , including National Security Adviser John Bolton , seeks to reshape longstanding American foreign policy toward Iran by emphasizing an explicit policy of regime change , something the Obama administration opposed when popular protests gripped Iran in 2009 ",0
"The regime change plan seeks to fundamentally shift U.S. policy towards Iran and has found a receptive audience in the Trump administration , which has been moving in this direction since Bolton — a longtime and vocal supporter of regime change — entered the White House ",0
"Ah , yes , John Bolton ",0
"While I applaud Bolton for his willingness to call Islamic jihadis just that , I am not so naive as to consider that his membership in the Council on Foreign Relations has no effect in this decision ",0
""""""""" The ordinary people of Iran are suffering under economic stagnation , while the regime ships its wealth abroad to fight its expansionist wars and to pad the bank accounts of the Mullahs and the IRGC command , """""""" SSG writes in the paper ",0
""""""""" This has provoked noteworthy protests across the country in recent months ",0
""""""""" ",0
"Well , why is that ? ",0
It 's due to sanctions imposed by the likes of the US ,0
"As has been pointed out before , sanctions hurt the people , not the governments that lead them and then those same governments use the effects to propagandize the people against those who are ordering the sanctions ",0
"I 'm not saying the Iranian government is good , but it is Iran 's government ",0
"Honestly , I see a ton of corruption and warmongering in our own government that rivals some of that of governments that America stands against ",0
"Still , as was pointed out by Matt Agorist , Bolton told an audience of the Grand Gathering of Iranians for Free Iran : ",0
"“ There is a viable opposition to the rule of the ayatollahs , and that opposition is centered in this room today ",0
"I had said for over 10 years since coming to these events , that the declared policy of the United States of America should be the overthrow of the mullahs’ regime in Tehran ",0
"The behavior and the objectives of the regime are not going to change , and therefore the only solution is to change the regime itself ",1
"And that ’s why , before 2019 , we here will celebrate in Tehran ! ” ",0
"And again , this really has nothing to do with the US ",0
"One source close to the White House who has previewed the plan told the Free Beacon that the nuclear deal , also known as the JCPOA , solidified the Iranian regime ’s grip on power and intentionally prevented the United States from fomenting regime change ",0
"“ The JCPOA purposefully destroyed the carefully created global consensus against the Islamic Republic , ” said the source , who would only speak to the Free Beacon on background about the sensitive issue ",0
"“ Prior to that , everyone understood the dangers of playing footsie with the world ’s largest state sponsor of terrorism ",0
"It ’s now Trump , Bolton , and [ Mike ] Pompeo ’s job to put this consensus back in place ",0
” ,0
The source told the Beacon that Bolton is “ acutely aware of the danger the Iranian regime poses to the region ,0
” ,0
"“ John is someone who understands the danger of Iran viscerally , and knows that you ’re never going to fundamentally change its behavior — and the threats against Israel and the Saudis especially — until that revolutionary regime is gone , ” the source said , adding that “ nothing ’s off the table right now if Israel is attacked ",0
” ,0
"OK , I get they may pose a danger , but let 's look at the reality here ",0
"Those they pose a danger to , namely Saudi Arabia and Israel can both fend perfectly well for themselves and have demonstrated that ability to do it ",0
There is no need for the US to be involved in it in any way ,0
"Why should we be fighting a battle or encouraging , funding , and I 'm quite sure arming , a rebellion ? ",0
Where is that authorized in our Constitution ? ,1
Simple ,0
It is n't ,0
I care little for the Saudi government as they help push Sharia and is the land where many of the 9 - 11 hijackers came from ,0
"The Iranian government I care for even less , but out of each of those , which one should America have dealt with militarily following 9 - 11 ? ",0
"Both , if you 're going to go by information that we have a record on ",0
Why ca n't America focus on it 's own issues and solve those ? ,0
"It 's because we are too busy trying to police the world , keeping the spotlight off of those in our government who are attacking our rights and spending us into more and more debt ",0
And lest you think this is about the nuclear deal ,0
It is n't ,0
"“ The problem is not the Iran nuclear deal it ’s the Iranian regime , ” the source told the Beacon ",0
"“ Team Bolton has spent years creating Plans B , C , and D for dealing with that problem ",0
President Trump hired him knowing all of that ,0
The administration will now start aggressively moving to deal with the root cause of chaos and violence in the region in a clear - eyed way ,1
” ,0
Bolton says it will be accomplished in the next six months ,0
I do n't doubt it ,1
"This will probably end up being another Ukraine situation , something we just do n't need to be in , and yes , I know , I 'll be called a liberal but honest readers who have followed me for some time know that 's not the case ",1
Notice some things that are taking place in Iran that the plan speaks about ,0
"“ More than one third of Iran ’s population is minority groups , many of whom already seek independence , ” the paper explains ",0
“ U.S. ,0
"support for these independence movements , both overt and covert , could force the regime to focus attention on them and limit its ability to conduct other malign activities ",0
” ,0
"“ The probability the current Iranian theocracy will stop its nuclear program willingly or even under significant pressure is low , ” the plan states ",0
"“ Absent a change in government within Iran , America will face a choice between accepting a nuclear - armed Iran or acting to destroy as much of this capability as possible ",1
” ,0
President Trump did made clear earlier in the week that we must make efforts to differentiate between the people of Iran and its ruling regime ,0
"Well , I agree , but that gets real messy when you start intervening in this manner ",0
"“ Any public discussion of these options , and any messaging about the Iranian regime in general , should make a bright line distinction between the theocratic regime along with its organs of oppression and the general populace , ” according to the plan ",0
“ We must constantly reinforce our support for removing the iron sandal from the necks of the people to allow them the freedom they deserve ,0
” ,0
But the Trump administration has spoken out on other countries where the people want their independence ,0
Remember the Kurds ? ,0
How about the people in the Catalan region of Spain ? ,0
"No support for those people , and why ? ",0
Cause it 's not part of the agenda ,0
"I say if the Iranian people want their freedom , let them first free themselves from the bondage of Islam , and then let the passion that burns inside men to be free rise up as it did in our forefathers due to the teachings fo the Holy Scriptures and stand and fight ",0
"Then , they will be in a position to ask for aid , but only then ",0
Florida shooting : Gun control law moves step closer ,0
"New gun control measures for Florida have passed another legal hurdle , weeks after one of the worst school shootings in US history ",1

"The bill , already passed by the Senate , now goes to the state governor ",0
"Seventeen people were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland , Florida , on 14 February ",0

"He is suspected of using a legally bought AR-15 semi - automatic rifle to carry out the 10-minute attack , gunning down teachers and students ",0
What is in the new law ? ,0
"In addition to raising the age and bringing in the three - day waiting period , the legislation : ",0
"Introduces a voluntary armed """""""" guardian programme """""""" for schools , named after Aaron Feis , a coach who died in the Parkland shooting ",0
"It allows school personnel to be armed , subject to school district approval and specialist training ",0
Classroom teachers are excluded from carrying arms unless they have a security forces background ,0
"Bans devices , such as bump stocks , that modify a semi - automatic weapon to fully automatic ",0
Raises mental health funding and increases the power to seize or ban guns under mental health concerns ,0
"The legislation does not include a ban on the sale of assault - style weapons like the AR-15 , despite it being a key demand of Parkland students and their parents ",0
Florida law already mandates a three - day waiting period for the purchase of a handgun but a person as young as 18 can buy a rifle with no waiting period ,0
The Republican - controlled House debated the bill for about eight hours on Wednesday before voting 67 - 50 in favour ,0
Has the move been welcomed ? ,0
"Ryan Petty , whose daughter was among those killed , hailed the House 's vote in a tweet ",1
"He said : """""""" We know that when it comes to preventing future acts of school violence , today 's vote is just the beginning of our journey ",0
""""""""" ",0
"State Democratic Party legislators who backed the bill said it was necessary despite the """""""" poison pill """""""" of allowing more guns in schools under the guardian programme ",1
Florida now joins at least six other states in allowing school employees to carry firearms ,0
"Following the Parkland shooting , many surviving students had lobbied politicians for greater gun control ",0
Gun control activists will hope the Florida measures will be a turning point in their battle with the powerful National Rifle Association and others who defend firearms ownership under the Second Amendment of the US constitution ,0
"On the day the vote passed , a 17-year - old woman student was killed in a suspected accidental shooting at a high school in Alabama ",0
What happens now ? ,0
"Governor Rick Scott will need to sign the bill , known as the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act , into law ",0
It will automatically become law within 15 days unless he vetoes it ,0
"Mr Scott has not yet said he will back it , telling reporters he would """""""" review the bill line by line """""""" and consult victims ' families ",0

Ex - Navy sailor pardoned by Trump says he 's suing Comey and Obama ,0
"A former Navy sailor who is one of five people to receive a pardon from President Donald Trump is planning to file a lawsuit against Obama administration officials , alleging that he was subject to unequal protection of the law ",0
"Specifically , Kristian Saucier , who served a year in federal prison for taking photos of classified sections of the submarine on which he worked , argues that the same officials who meted out punishment to him for his actions chose to be lenient with Hillary Clinton in her use of a private email server and handling of classified information ",0
"His lawyer , Ronald Daigle , told Fox News on Monday that the lawsuit , which he expects to file soon in Manhattan , will name the U.S. Department of Justice , former FBI Director James Comey and former President Barack Obama as defendants , among others ",0
"“ They interpreted the law in my case to say it was criminal , ” Saucier told Fox News , referring to prosecuting authorities in his case , “ but they did n’t prosecute Hillary Clinton ",0
Hillary is still walking free ,0
Two guys on my ship did the same thing and were n’t treated as criminals ,0
We want them to correct the wrong ,0
” ,0
Daigle said that a notice about the pending lawsuit was sent to the Department of Justice and others included in it in December ,0
There is usually a six - month period that must lapse before the lawsuit actually is filed ,0
"“ We ’ll highlight the differences in the way Hillary Clinton was prosecuted and how my client was prosecuted , ” Daigle said ",0
“ We ’re seeking to cast a light on this to show that there ’s a two - tier justice system and we want it to be corrected ,0
” ,0
"While campaigning , and after taking office , Trump frequently voiced support for Saucier , who in March became the second person he pardoned ",0
Trump often compared the Obama administration ’s handling of Saucier ’s case with that of Clinton ,0
"Saucier , who lives in Vermont , pleaded guilty in 2016 to taking photos inside the USS Alexandria while it was stationed in Groton , Connecticut , in 2009 ",0
"He said he only wanted service mementos , but federal prosecutors argued he was a disgruntled sailor who had put national security at risk by taking photos showing the submarine 's propulsion system and reactor compartment and then obstructed justice by destroying a laptop and camera ",0
"Saucier said that he recognized he had erred in taking the photos , which he said he wanted to show only to his family to show them where he worked ",0
"But he lashed out at Obama officials , saying that his prosecution was politically motivated , prompted by sensitivity about classified information amid the scandal involving Clinton 's emails ",0
"“ My case was usually something handled by military courts , ” he said ",0
“ They used me as an example because of [ the backlash over ] Hillary Clinton ,1
” ,1
"Saucier , 31 , said that the pardon has enabled him to pick up the pieces and rebuild his life with his wife and young daughter ",0
A felony conviction left him scrambling to find work ; he finally landed a job collecting garbage ,0
"Now , he works on design and engineering projects for an industrial boiler company ",0
"“ Things are starting to go in the right direction , ” Saucier said ",0
"“ I work with a group of really great people , I get to use my skills set ",0

"Because of the loss of income during his imprisonment , as well as earning below his potential when he collected garbage , he and his wife Sadie lost their home to foreclosure ",0

"Ex - Democratic National Committee head Debbie Wasserman Schultz said she intervened in a Pakistani land deal involving her then – IT aide Imran Awan , according to two House employees ",0
"The dispute came after Awan ’s father was charged with fraud in relation to the deal , and the mysterious exertion of political influence resulted in Pakistani authorities instead targeting the elderly alleged victims , according to a local report ",0
"And when a House Office of Inspector General cybersecurity investigation found that Awan made “ unauthorized access ” to House servers , including the House Democratic Caucus’ shortly before the election , Wasserman Schultz became “ frantic , not normal , ” “ making the rounds ” to House officials in an attempt to kill the investigation , one House employee told The Daily Caller News Foundation ",1
"Awan told people Wasserman Schultz chose the name for his daughter , Leza — a Jewish name — and that the Florida congresswoman ’s daughter regularly rode a horse that Awan kept at a boarding facility , sources with knowledge of the relationship told TheDCNF ",1
"Wasserman Schultz cornered House Chief Administrative Officer Phil Kiko and called him a “ fucking Islamophobe , ” saying “ you will not so much as take away their parking spots , ” the two House employees said Kiko told them ",1
"The congresswoman also told Kiko she had invited Awan ’s whole family to her daughter ’s bat mitzvah and said she had “ helped him with a land deal , ” the sources said ",0
A spokesman for Kiko declined to comment on this story ,0
"A 2009 article in the Pakistani publication Dawn , headlined “ Influential expat shields father from long arm of law , ” said Awan ’s father was facing criminal fraud charges involving a land deal , but Awan used political connections to pressure the police into targeting the alleged victims instead ",1
"Awan ’s father purchased “ huge chunks of land from different farmers in 2008 , ” but all the checks bounced , the report said ",0
"“ The police high - ups are ‘ ominously’ indifferent to proceed against Awan , ” and it ’s “ noteworthy ” how they were “ complying with the desires of ” Awan , who the paper described as a “ White House employee ",1

"Imran Awan also goes by Shahid Imran Awan , Virginia court records show ",0
"The police harassed the 19 would - be victims , including the five elderly brothers and even their lawyer , and charged them with “ frivolous ” cases , apparently to get them to stop trying to get the money they say they were owed , the paper said ",0
"“ Mohammad Abid , a victim of [ Ashraf ] Awan ’s alleged high - profile swindling , said that [ Ashraf ] Awan ’s son had easy access to the corridors of power and that ’s why he was able to [ pressure ] the police to dance to his tunes , ” Dawn reported ",1
"The article details a series of people who say they were then subject to retaliation , including widow Bushra Bibi who said , “ now Imran was threatening her with dire consequences ",1
” ,0
"A third source , who ’s familiar with Imran Awan , told TheDCNF that Awan recounted the intervention in the foreign criminal matter and that Awan said it was Wasserman Schultz who intervened ",0
A fourth source — a fellow House IT aide — previously told TheDCNF that Awan said now - Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel wasinvolved ,0
"Dr. Zafar Iqbal , one of the alleged victims , told TheDCNF that “ Imran came to Pakistan to get [ his father ] out of jail , since he had some [ connections ] in the Congress ",0

"Ashraf Awan ’s business partner in the land deal , Rashid Minhas , told TheDCNF that the elder Awan gave a USB to a Pakistani senator who is a former head of a Pakistani intelligence agency , and that Imran claimed his IT position in Congress gave him the power to “ change the U.S. president ",1
” Minhas is in prison for an unrelated fraud charge ,0
"On July 25 , 2016 , the House Inspector General notified the Committee on House Administration that investigators had detected major cybersecurity violations by the Awan family ",0
"Awan , his wife , two brothers , his brother ’s wife , and even his elderly father were all being paid by various Democrats to manage their servers , with many of the members from Wasserman Schultz ’s Florida ",0
"The finding came at a critical time for Democrats : It was three days after WikiLeaks published the first emails from a hacked on the DNC , setting the stage for Wasserman Schultz to lose her position as party chair and for Democrats to begin electioneering on a theme of Russian hacking ",0
"In February 2017 , Kiko and the House ’s top law enforcement official , Paul Irving , outlined serious violations in a letter to the committee , and the family was banned from the House computer network ",0
The letter also noted that the House Democratic Caucus server disappeared soon after the IG report named it as key evidence ,0
"But Wasserman Schultz refused to fire Awan , with her spokesman saying he would work on “ websites ” and “ printers , ” which a cybersecurity expert previously told TheDCNF would presumably involve network access ",0
"The congresswoman also added Awan ’s wife , Hina Alvi , to her payroll in late 2016 , after the investigation was in full swing , but before the family was banned from the network ",0
"Wasserman Schultz kept paying her until March 17 — 12 days after Alvi went to Pakistan with $ 12,000 in a suitcase ",0
"Her actions so rattled the Administration Committee ’s Democratic staff director , Jamie Fleet , that he planted a negative story in Politico that revealed Wasserman Schultz , his fellow Democrat , was continuing to pay the suspect , two House sources said ",1

He added that his office should have the authority to override members who would want to keep a rule - breaker on the government network ,1
"Wasserman Schultz became fixated on finding out everything investigators knew about Awan , the House sources said ",0
"House investigators briefed her extensively with significant evidence about Awan and his family , including improper computer evidence ",0

"Capitol Police found a laptop with the username RepDWS in a phone booth at midnight along with a copy of Awan ’s ID , a letter to prosecutors and a note that said “ attorney client privilege , ” according to a police report ",0
"Awan ’s ID caused police to tie it to a criminal suspect and seize it , but the note kept them from looking at it ",0
"That led to a tense exchange recorded on video in May 2017 , in which Wasserman Schultz threatened the chief of the Capitol Police with “ consequences ” for not returning the laptop ",0
"When he refused , she mulled attempting to restructuring the Capitol Police ’s entire board so that her committee would have more leverage over it ",0

FBI IG Report : A Slap On The Wrist ,0
"Department of Justice Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz has released his 500 plus - page report , which purports to shine a light on the mishandling at top levels of the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation of the 2016 investigation into Hillary Clinton ’s use of a private e - mail server while she served as Secretary of State under former President Obama ",0
Such mishandling included violations of Department of Justice standards and FBI protocols ,0
"The report from the Department of Justice ’s Office of the Inspector General ( “ OIG ” ) criticized certain actions and decisions of former FBI Director James Comey , together with those of other senior FBI officials who were involved in the probe , including former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe ",0
Mr. McCabe is already the subject of an earlier criminal referral from the OIG for his alleged unauthorized leaks to the media and lying to federal investigators about his media contacts ,0
"Special FBI agent Peter Stzrok and Lisa Page , an attorney who has since left the FBI , were targeted in this report for their blatantly anti - Trump text messages ",1
Former Attorney General Loretta Lynch was also criticized for exercising bad judgment in connection with her infamous tarmac meeting with Bill Clinton ,1
Mr. Horowitz ’s report focused on process and procedures ,0
The inspector general made clear when he launched his investigation in January 2017 that “ his review will not substitute the OIG 's judgment for the judgments made by the FBI or the Department regarding the substantive merits of investigative or prosecutive decisions ,0
""""""""" ",0
"Moreover , this report did not address whether the Department of Justice or FBI abused the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to obtain a surveillance order against former Trump campaign advisor Carter Page , or the government ’s reliance on former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele ’s salacious and unverified “ dossier ” in its FISA court application , which the OIG is investigating separately ",1
"In analyzing the highly anticipated OIG report ’s conclusions , it is clear that either Mr. Horowitz himself decided to pull his punches or that the final version , which had been reviewed by upper echelons in both the FBI and Justice Department before its public release , emerged in a disappointingly watered - down form ",1
"To be sure , the report faulted Comey for deviating from FBI and Justice Department procedures in handling the probe into Hillary Clinton ’s use of a private e - mail server while she served as Secretary of State , thereby negatively impacting “ the perception of the FBI and the department as fair administrators of justice ",0
"” Comey , according to the OIG report , “ engaged in ad hoc decision making based on his personal views even if it meant rejecting longstanding Department policy or practice ",0

"Starting with Comey ’s public announcement on July 5 , 2016 criticizing Hillary Clinton and her staff for being “ extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive , highly classified information , ” but also announcing that the FBI was “ expressing to Justice our view that no charges are appropriate in this case , ” Comey was taken to task for insubordination and usurping the authority of the attorney general ",1
"He “ upset the well - established separation between investigative and prosecutorial functions , ” the report said ",0
"Comey ’s follow - up letters to Congress on October 28 and November 6 , 2016 were similarly criticized ",0
"The first letter informed Congress that agents were reopening their probe into Clinton ’s handling of classified material after discovering her e - mails on the laptop of Andrew Weiner , the husband of Clinton ’s top aide Huma Abedin ",0
"This letter was followed on November 6 , 2016 by Comey ’s statement that the review of the additional information had been completed and that the FBI remained convinced that charges were not appropriate ",0
Comey acted against the advice of senior Justice Department officials in making these disclosures the way he did ,0
"The OIG report was highly critical of the FBI ’s failure to take immediate action on the Weiner laptop when they first learned about it in late September 2016 , rather than waiting another month so close to the election ",0
"The criticisms of Comey 's undisciplined behavior was all well and good , but it was reasonable to expect something more than the equivalent of a departmental employee review after nearly a year and a half of investigation ",0
"Hillary Clinton ’s supporters will no doubt jump on the inspector general ’s criticisms of Comey ’s handling of the July 5th announcement and subsequent letters as proof that he improperly influenced the outcome of the election in President Trump ’s favor , even if he did not do so deliberately for political reasons ",0
"However , what Comey really did was to give Hillary Clinton a Get Out of Jail Free card ",1
"The fix was in as early as May 2016 , well before the FBI interviews of Hillary Clinton and of as many as 17 other key witnesses , when Comey began the process of drafting an exoneration memo ",0
"Comey ’s initial draft statement , which he shared with FBI senior leadership on May 2 , criticized Clinton ’s handling of classified information as “ grossly negligent , ” but concluded that “ no reasonable prosecutor ” would bring a case based on the facts developed in the investigation ",1
"Indeed , Comey admitted in his book that “ we started the Clinton investigation aware that it was unlikely to be a case that career prosecutors at the Department of Justice would prosecute ",0
” ,0
"If putting the cart of exoneration before the horse of investigation were not enough , Comey ’s draft statement underwent various language changes over the course of the next two months , including , most importantly , changing the description of Clinton ’s handling of classified information from “ grossly negligent ” to “ extremely careless ",1
” This change was critical because “ gross negligence ” is specifically the legal term used in stating the statutory requirement in 18 U.S. Code § 793(f ) for a finding of criminal conduct ,1
"Comey ’s substitution of a legally meaningless phrase , “ extremely careless , ” for the “ gross negligence ” statutory legal standard he had originally used , had the effect of prejudging the facts in Hillary Clinton ’s favor ",1
"Andrew McCabe , Peter Strzok and Lisa Page were involved in the edits ",0
Inspector General Horowitz saw no problem with this pattern of obfuscation regarding the deletion of the legally significant phrase “ gross negligence ” from Comey ’s statement ,1
Mr. Horowitz relied in part on opinions from prosecutors that there was not enough evidence to charge Clinton with acting in a manner that rose to a level of criminal gross negligence with respect to sending or receiving e - mails determined to contain classified information ,1
"Mr. Horowitz ’s report thus concluded , “ We did not identify evidence of bias or improper considerations ",0
” This conclusion defies common sense ,0
"Gross negligence is not the same as willful intent , which Comey and his team sought to conflate in exonerating Hillary Clinton before the investigation was concluded ",1
"Clinton was fully aware of what she was doing when she set up the private server arrangement in the first place and knowingly used it to send and receive e - mails involving official government business , which by their very nature would be expected to include classified information ",0
It turns out that some of the e - mails were accessed by foreign parties ,0
Hillary lied repeatedly when she first denied there were any classified e - mails on her system and then described some of the e - mails involved in the investigation as having been classified after the fact ,0
"As Comey has admitted , several e - mail chains concerned matters that were classified at the Top Secret / Special Access Program level when they were sent and received by Clinton ",0
"Coupled with her agents’ destruction of thousands of e - mails that had been subpoenaed by Congress , Hillary ’s conduct was criminally reckless at the very least , if not constituting willful intent to commit an act she knew was wrongful ",1
Yet Mr. Horowitz saw no reason to doubt the sincerity of Comey 's explanations for giving Hillary a free pass ,0
"The failure to at least empanel a grand jury to compel testimony from Hillary Clinton and key witnesses was itself a complete dereliction of duty , which could have only been motivated by a desire to treat Hillary Clinton with kid gloves for improper reasons ",1
"Incredibly , however , Mr. Horowitz ’s report “ found no persuasive evidence … that the outcome of the investigation would have been different had Clinton been subpoenaed before the grand jury ",0
” ,0
Mr. Horowitz also did not deem Comey ’s possible perjury in his testimony before Congress to be an appropriate subject for criminal referral ,0
"Comey testified that his decision to exonerate Hillary was not made before her interview took place , when for all intents and purposes it was ",0
Mr. Horowitz simply took Comey ’s word for what he had meant ,0
"Inspector General Horowitz again emphasized form and process over substance in finding a “ troubling lack of any direct , substantive communication ” between Comey and Attorney General Lynch ahead of Comey ’s July 5 press conference on Clinton and his October 28 letter to Congress ",0
"Attorney General Lynch ’s infamous tarmac meeting with Bill Clinton was discussed in the report , but mostly in the context of how it affected Comey ’s decision to go rogue , so to speak , in making his July 5th announcement without prior approval from the Justice Department ",1
"As to the substance of Ms. Lynch ’s decision to meet with Bill Clinton at all before his wife ’s FBI interview , all Mr. Horowitz ’s report had to say was that it was “ an error in judgment ",0
” ,0
"The OIG report also criticized the conduct of Peter Strzok and Lisa Page , who had exchanged text messages sharply critical of Mr. Trump before and after the election , for casting “ a cloud over the entire FBI investigation ",1
"” The report referenced a text message on August 8 , 2016 , in which Strzok reassured Page that she need not worry about Donald Trump becoming president ",0
"Trump is “ not ever going to become president , right ? ",0
Right ? ,0
! ” Page texted Strzok ,0
“ No ,0
No he ’s not ,0
"We ’ll stop it , ” Strzok responded ",0
"Mr. Horowitz wrote that this exchange was “ not only indicative of a biased state of mind but , even more seriously , implies a willingness to take official action to impact the presidential candidate ’s electoral prospects ",0
” The inspector general questioned whether Strzok ’s decision to prioritize the Russia collusion investigation over following up on the Clinton e - mail - related investigative lead discovered on the Weiner laptop was free from bias ,0
"Ultimately , however , he inexplicably concluded that there was no finding of “ documentary or testimonial evidence that improper considerations , including political bias , directly affected the specific investigative decisions ” discussed in the OIG report ",1
Strzok should have been subject to a criminal referral for arguably violating 18 U.S.C. ,0
"§ 595 , enacted as part of the original 1939 Hatch Act , prohibiting any public officer or employee , in connection with an activity financed wholly or in part by the United States , from using his or her official authority to interfere with or affect the nomination or election of a candidate for federal office including the president of the United States ",0
"The punishment for violation is a fine , imprisonment for not more than one year or both ",0
"Instead , Strzok 's punishment will most likely be limited to disciplinary action and possibly dismissal ",0
"In sum , the long - awaited inspector general report on the FBI ’s and Justice Department ’s handling of the Hillary Clinton e - mail investigation is as disappointing as the rigged outcome of the e - mail investigation itself ",1
President Trump Orders FBI Investigation Into Kavanaugh Following Democrat Temper Tantrum ,1
"Thought Judge Brett Kavanaugh has been through at least 6 FBI background checks , because of Senate Democrat temper tantrums and RINO Republican Senator Jeff Flake 's desire to have another FBI investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh with zero evidence , President Trump succumbed to the pressure and issued an executive order on Friday that authorizes another FBI background check into Kavanaugh ",1
“ I ’ve ordered the FBI to conduct a supplemental investigation to update Judge Kavanaugh ’s file ,0
"As the Senate has requested , this update must be limited in scope and completed in less than one week , ” the president said in a statement ",0

The statement came just a day after Senate Democrats continued their smear of Kavanaugh by declaring they believed Dr. Christine Ford 's allegations against him while at the same time obviously not believing his denial of the allegations ,1
"On top of that , there has been zero evidence submitted to the committee that Ford 's allegations are true ",0
"In fact , everything submitted has refuted her claims , from sworn statements by those she claims were there to Kavanaugh 's calendar to character statements by dozens of women who have known him since high school to those he has worked with in DC ",0

"Well , Senator Flake has given the Democrats what they wanted and you can bet that they are still going to vote pretty much on party lines concerning Kavanaugh ",0
"Now , President Trump has gone along with it ",0
"My guess is that one of two things will occur with the FBI investigation : ( 1 ) Absolutely nothing will be found , and this will have been a huge waste of time or ( 2 ) look for this thing to expand and the need will arise to make this more of a circus than it already is , which will dwarf anything Clarence Thomas had to face from the slanderous accusations of Anita Hill ",1
"Remember , whether you like Judge Kavanaugh or not , this has been nothing but a political hit ",1

"At the end of the day , Horowitz was unable to find solid proof that the agency acted in a politically partisan and biased manner in the Clinton email case ",0
"However , the Inspector General left the door open to the possibility that political bias did indeed play a role , as his current investigation in the Russia - Collusion probe of the FBI and the DOJ could reveal new evidence to damn the FBI ’s Obama era leadership ",1
"While the report refuses to say conclusively that political bias was the animus behind the FBI ’s handling of the Clinton probe , it also indicates that IG Horowitz may have more to say about the FBI ’s political leanings in his Russia report ",0
The Washington Post explains : ,0
"The Justice Department inspector general on Thursday castigated former FBI Director James B. Comey for his actions during the Hillary Clinton email investigation and found that other senior bureau officials showed a “ willingness to take official action ” to prevent Donald Trump from becoming president … Some senior bureau officials , the report found , exhibited a disturbing “ willingness to take official action ” to hurt Trump ’s chances to become president ",1
"Perhaps the most damaging new revelation in the report is a previously - unreported text message in which Peter Strzok , a key investigator on both the Clinton email case and the investigation of Russia and the Trump campaign , assured an FBI lawyer in August 2016 that “ we ’ll stop ” Trump from making it to the White House ",1
"“ [ Trump ’s ] not ever going to become president , right ? ",0
Right ? ,0
"! ” the lawyer , Lisa Page , wrote to Strzok ",0
“ No ,0
No he wo n’t ,0
"We ’ll stop it , ” Strzok responded … ",0
"The inspector general concluded that Strzok ’s text , along with others disparaging Trump , “ is not only indicative of a biased state of mind but , even more seriously , implies a willingness to take official action to impact the presidential candidate ’s electoral prospects ",1
” ,0
"The messages “ potentially indicated or created the appearance that investigative decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations , ” the inspector general wrote … ",0
"Strzok has argued that he was just trying to reassure Page that Trump could n’t win , and that he was n’t implying that they would take action to stop his election ",0
"But it was n’t just Page and Strzok , there were FIVE other investigators on the Clinton case who expressed overtly political views in support of Clinton and/or against Trump … DURING the investigation ",1
Page and Strzok are not the only FBI officials assigned to the Clinton email probe who were found to have exchanged personal messages indicating either an animus against Trump or frustration with the fact that the FBI was investigating Clinton ,0
"The report identified five officials with some connection to the email probe who were expressing political views , faulting them for having brought “ discredit to themselves , sowed doubt about the FBI ’s handling of the midyear investigation , and impacted the reputation of the FBI ",0
” The midyear investigation refers to the Clinton email probe ,0
"“ The messages cast a cloud over the FBI investigations to which these employees were assigned , ” Horowitz alleged ",0
"“ Ultimately the consequences of these actions impact not only the senders of these messages but also other who worked on these investigation and , indeed , the entire FBI ",0
” ,0
"The IG also found that the FBI moved slowly on new evidence that could have damned Hillary Clinton , and did so for reasons that make no sense ",1
The report took particular aim at FBI officials investigating Clinton ’s email server for moving slowly after agents in the New York Field office discovered messages on the laptop of disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner that might be relevant to their case ,1
"By no later than September 29 , the inspector general alleged , the bureau had learned “ virtually every fact ” it would cite as justification late the next month to search Weiner ’s laptop for messages of Clinton and top aide Huma Abedin ",0
"The inspector general derided the bureau ’s reasons for not moving more quickly — that agents were waiting for additional information from New York , that they could n’t move without a warrant and that investigators were more focused on the Russia case — as “ unpersuasive , ” “ illogical , ” and inconsistent with their assertion that they would leave no stone unturned on Clinton ",1
"The report also faulted the bureau for assigning essentially the same personnel to the Russia and Clinton teams , and singled out Strzok , suggesting his anti - Trump views might have played a role in his not acting more expeditiously on the new lead ",0
"“ Under these circumstances , we did not have confidence that Strzok ’s decision to prioritize the Russia investigation over following up on the Midyear - related investigative lead discovered on the Weiner laptop was free from bias , ” the report said ",1
Did you get that ? ,0
"IG Horowitz ca n’t prove it , but he ’s not sure that Strzok was n’t acting in a politically biased manner when he slow - played the Clinton investigation while moving more quickly on the Russia investigation ",0
How in the world can we trust them even as they express bias while investigating malfeasance ? ,1
"We see this kind of corruption all over the world , why should believe that these officials could be immune to acting on their personal biases ? ",0
"There were 7 of them on the case , and they were comfortable enough with each other to express their biases openly and none of them ever chastised the others for expressing those biases ! ",0
"Not only that , the team that handled Clinton ’s investigation so poorly was almost the identical team that was then assigned to handle the Russia investigation ! ",0
"Meaning , the obviously politically biased team that had just cleared the woman that they supported , was now tapped to investigate if the man that they hated was tied to Russian corruption ",0
This is INSANE ,1
"Meanwhile , another story just breaking at Fox News provides even more evidence that Peter Strzok is the big bad guy in the FBI mess ",1
"Not only was he slow - playing the Clinton investigation , he may be the only reason she was never charged with a crime ",0
"In a newly released FBI email , we learned that “ foreign actors ” gained at least some access to Hillary Clinton ’s unsecure email system ",0
"Fox News obtained the memo prepared by the House Judiciary and Oversight committees , which lays out key interim findings ahead of next week ’s hearing with Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz ",0
"The IG , separately , is expected to release his highly anticipated report on the Clinton email case later Thursday ",0
"The House committees , which conducted a joint probe into decisions made by the DOJ in 2016 and 2017 , addressed a range of issues in their memo including Clinton ’s email security ",0
"“ Documents provided to the Committees show foreign actors obtained access to some of Mrs. Clinton ’s emails — including at least one email classified ‘ Secret , ' ” the memo says , adding that foreign actors also accessed the private accounts of some Clinton staffers ",0
Here ’s the email in question : ,0
Peter Strzok email about Clinton emails by Fox News on Scribd ,0
"The email came from FBI agent Peter Strzok and it ’s the first place we see the question of whether or not Clinton can be found as “ grossly negligent , ” in the handling of classified intel ",1
"Remember , Strzok is widely credited as the man who changed FBI Director Comey ’s language on the Clinton email investigation from the prosecutable “ grossly negligent ” to the legally superflous “ extremely careless ",1
” ,0
At HotAir.com John Sexton explains the importance of this discovery : ,0
"In the FBI memo , you can already see the genesis of the distinction the FBI would rely on to clear Clinton ",0
Strzok writes that the media has been focused on the question of why Hillary seems to be getting a pass when “ Petraeus / Berger / Libby ” did not ,0
"He writes , “ We draw the distinction in noting we have no evidence classified information was ever shared with an unauthorized party , i.e. ",0
"notwithstanding the server setup , we have not seen classified information shared with a member of the media , an agent of a foreign power , a lover , etc ",0
"” In other words , Hillary may have been hacked but she did n’t intentionally give anything away ",0
"Of course , the statute itself did n’t make intent a prerequisite ",0
"Herridge reports that the House committee memo once again raises this same issue : “ Officials from both agencies have created a perception they misinterpreted the Espionage Act by stating Secretary Clinton lacked the requisite ‘ intent’ for charges to be filed , ” the memo says , before pointing to statements by Comey that indicated a belief that intent was required — which the memo says ignored “ meaningful aspects ” of the law ",0
"It really does seem that Strzok , an agent who had a personal pro - Hillary bias , was the person who pushed to let her off the hook by focusing on her intent rather than her negligence setting up the server in the first place ",0
I fully believe IG Horowitz’ findings here ,1
"I believe that he was unable to prove that there was any political motive to the FBI ’s handling of the Clinton email case , and I believe that while the case was obviously mishandled , it could have reached the conclusion it did honorably ",1
"However , I also think that the IG has purposely left room in his conclusion to amend that decision after he ’s concluded his Russia investigation ",0
"In fact , there are already signs of him doing that in this report ",0
"Much of the information that he uses to chastise Strzok ’s behavior and judgment in the Clinton email case , would have actually come from his current investigation into the Russia mess ",0
"It ’s quite possible that as bad as this report is for Comey , Strzok , Page , and Obama ’s FBI leadership … Horowitz’ conclusion in the Russia investigation could prove to be even worse ",1

German cardinal : liturgical ‘ blessing’ for gay unions is ‘ truly … sacrilegious’ ,1
NewsCatholic Church ,0
"GERMANY , February 8 , 2018 ( LifeSiteNews ) – Cardinal Paul Josef Cordes criticized fellow German Cardinal Reinhard Marx ’s suggestion that Catholic priests should consider “ blessing ” same - sex relationships liturgically ",0
"Marx ’s idea “ truly seems sacrilegious ” and “ ignores the clear Revelation of God , ” Cordes wrote in a response on kath.net ",1
Dr. Maike Hickson translated it at One Peter Five ,0
"“ The Church is in its pastoral care bound to Holy Scripture and to its interpretation through the Church ’s Magisterium , ” wrote Cordes ",0
"“ Marx does not even mention that homosexuality always contradicts the Will of God , ” citing church teaching through the centuries ",1
"Rather than being about receiving “ God ’s assistance for themselves , ” those engaging in sodomy and wishing to have it “ blessed ” by the Church “ aim with their request at the recognition and acceptance of their homosexual way of life and its ecclesial valorization ",1
” ,1
The Catechism of the Catholic Church teaches that “ under no circumstances ” can homosexual activity “ be approved ” as it is “ intrinsically disordered ,1
” Such acts are “ contrary to the natural law ,1
They close the sexual act to the gift of life ,1
They do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity ” ( CCC 2357 ) ,1
"However , Marx said on February 3 that homosexual couples need “ closer pastoral care ” and “ one must also encourage priests and pastoral workers to give people in concrete situations [ of homosexual unions ] encouragement ",0
I do not really see any problems there ,1
” ,1
Marx is the President of the German Bishops’ Conference ,0
"As LifeSiteNews previously reported , Marx also said “ yes , ” he could imagine the creation of a rite for homosexual couples to be blessed in the Church ",0
This “ encouragement ” from priests which he called for might include some sort of “ liturgical ” recognition of their union ,0
"But “ how this would be done publicly , in a liturgical form , ” is “ another question ... that is where one has to be reticent and also reflect upon that in a good way ",0
” ,0
"After Catholic News Agency ’s initial report on Marx ’s comments , his office contacted the outlet and said they had mistranslated part of what he said ",0
"The cardinal ’s office sent CNA “ a request for correction of [ its ] translation of the interview in question , expressing concern that CNA 's translation constitutes a false reference and does not properly reflect the position of Cardinal Marx ",0
” ,0
"The cardinal ’s office maintains that rather than saying “ yes , ” there is a possibility of liturgical “ blessing ” of gay unions , he answered the question in a more subtle way without giving an explicit “ yes ",1
"” However , the German Bishops’ Conference does n’t seem to deny the rest of his statements on how “ one must encourage priests ” to give encouragement to homosexual couples , which could include public blessings that would take a “ liturgical ” form ",1
"The cardinal ’s staff asked that CNA change his answer about liturgically “ blessing ” gay unions to : “ There are no general solutions and I think that would not be right , because we are talking about pastoral care for individual cases , and that applies to other areas as well , which we can not regulate , where we have no sets of rules ",1
” ,1
Philadelphia Archbishop Charles Chaput has also spoken out against Marx ’s proposal ,0
"“ Any such ‘ blessing rite’ would cooperate in a morally forbidden act , no matter how sincere the persons seeking the blessing , ” wrote Chaput ",1
"He explained such a “ blessing ” would encourage people to continue living in a way the Church considers gravely sinful and spiritually damaging , and therefore would be uncharitable ",1
"“ There is no love – no charity – without truth , just as there is no real mercy separated from a framework of justice informed and guided by truth , ” he wrote ",0
"“ Creating confusion around important truths of our faith , no matter how positive the intention , only makes a difficult task more difficult ",0
” ,0
"“ There are two principles we need to remember , ” Chaput wrote ",0
"“ First , we need to treat all people with the respect and pastoral concern they deserve as children of God with inherent dignity ",1
This emphatically includes persons with same - sex attraction ,0
"Second , there is no truth , no real mercy , and no authentic compassion , in blessing a course of action that leads persons away from God ",1
” ,1
"“ This in no way is a rejection of the persons seeking such a blessing , but rather a refusal to ignore what we know to be true about the nature of marriage , the family , and the dignity of human sexuality , ” he explained ",0

Nowhere did he suggest it will make us comfortable ,1

Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills : ‘ The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’ ,1
"Outside of specialists and seekers , the only reason why there is general interest in the Qur’an among non - Muslims is to seek an answer to the question of whether or not it justifies and encourages Islamic terrorism ",1
"With What the Qur’an Meant : And Why It Matters , religion author Garry Wills is here to reassure us : ",0
What did the scripture of Islam tell me about the duty to kill infidels ? ,1
"Some people are sure it is there , though it is n’t ",0
Then what does it say about Shari’ah law ? ,0
Not a thing ( p. 7 ) ,0
"That would be good to know , were Wills a reliable witness ",1
"Unfortunately , he proves to be just the opposite : Wills laments “ Robert Spencer of Jihad Watch calling for a ban on the Qur’an ” ( p. 58 ) ",1
"I have never called for such a ban , and oppose in principle the banning of any book ",0
"Wills , not surprisingly , does not offer any quotation from me to back up his false claim ",1
His manifest unreliability on this point casts a shadow on his primary assertions about the Qur’an ,0
"Wills seems determined to put the best possible face on the Qur’an , which requires him to ignore a great deal of Qur’anic incitement and hatred ",1
"For example , he quotes 5:51 -- “ You who believe , do not take the Jews and Christians as allies ” ( p. 114 ) -- but he nonetheless concludes , after ten pages of tu quoque arguments and other legerdemain , that “ the Qur’an is fraternal in its treatment of other faiths ” ( p. 124 ) ",1
"Wills never mentions Qur’an 9:29 , which commands Muslims to wage war against Jews and Christians and subjugate them as inferiors under the rule of Sharia ",1
Wills is no more trustworthy when he deals with the question of violence in the Qur’an ,1
"He renders one key passage in this way : “ Fight then until there is no more persecution , and worship [ at the shrine ] is devoted to God ” ( 2:193 ; p. 133 ) ",0
Whence the bracketed interpolation “ at the shrine ” ? ,0
Wills does n’t give any source for it ; apparently it comes from none other than Garry Wills himself ,1
"By adding “ at the shrine ” to this verse , Wills restricts the call to fight to the area around the Sacred Mosque in Mecca ",0
He ignores the fact that some Islamic authorities see this passage as calling for nothing less than unlimited warfare against non - Muslims ,1
The prominent Twentieth Century Indian Islamic scholar Muhammad Ashiq Ilahi Bulandshahri explains the passage this way : ,0
"The worst of sins are Infidelity ( Kufr ) and Polytheism ( shirk ) which constitute rebellion against Allah , The Creator ",0
"To eradicate these , Muslims are required to wage war until there exists none of it in the world , and the only religion is that of Allah ",1
"Wills does n’t mention the existence of such interpretations , even to dismiss them ",1
"Likewise , when he claims that the Qur’an has “ not a thing ” to say about Sharia , he appears unaware that the Qur’an is one of the sources of Sharia ",1
"The Qur’an ’s declarations that a woman ’s testimony is worth half that of a man ’s ( 2:282 ) , that a daughter is to receive a smaller part of an inheritance than a son receives ( 4:11 ) , that thieves are to have their hands amputated ( 5:38 ) , and that those who “ wage war against Allah and his messenger ” are to be crucified or have a hand and foot amputated on opposite sides ( 5:33 ) are part of Sharia in all its various expressions ",0
"Because these stipulations are found in the Qur’an , they can not be questioned or set aside ",0
"Throughout his book , Wills’ assurances that the Qur’an is not really as bad as “ right - wing Islamophobes ” say , or that the Bible contains material that is just as bad or worse , dissolve under close scrutiny ",1
Again and again it turns out that Wills has ignored key passages in order to make his case ,1
He asks why the Qur’an is “ so ferocious to ‘ hypocrites’ and apostates ” ( p. 124 ) ,1
Then he offers a quotation from the New Testament Letter to the Hebrews saying that “ if we sin again on purpose ” there is “ only a terrifying judgment to come ” ( p. 126 ) ,1
"Wills concludes : “ The Qur’an is not as absolute as this , because it always leaves room for God ’s inexhaustible mercy and forgiveness ” ( p. 126 ) ",1
"That sounds wonderful , and certainly pleasing to multicultural ears to learn that the Qur’an is more merciful than the New Testament ",1
"Until one realizes that , in his discussion of apostasy in the Qur’an , Wills has omitted all mention of the primary Qur’anic passage on this topic : ",1

"“ Weighing the Allegations against Brett Kavanaugh , ” by David French , National Review , September 16 , 2018 : ",0
They ’re serious but not solid ,0
The allegations against Brett Kavanaugh — outlined now on the record in the Washington Post by Palo Alto University professor Christine Blasey Ford — are substantial and serious ,0
"She claims that Kavanaugh knocked her down , groped her , and attempted to remove her clothes ",0
Here ’s the core of her story : ,0
"While his friend watched , she said , Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed on her back and groped her over her clothes , grinding his body against hers and clumsily attempting to pull off her one - piece bathing suit and the clothing she wore over it ",0
"When she tried to scream , she said , he put his hand over her mouth ",0
"“ I thought he might inadvertently kill me , ” said Ford , now a 51-year - old research psychologist in northern California ",0
“ He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing ,0
"” Ford said she was able to escape when Kavanaugh ’s friend and classmate at Georgetown Preparatory School , Mark Judge , jumped on top of them , sending all three tumbling ",0
"She said she ran from the room , briefly locked herself in a bathroom and then fled the house ",0
Do not count me among those who would minimize this alleged assault ,0
"I went to a high school that had more than its share of drunken parties , and my classmates could do crazy and stupid things , but an act like this was beyond the pale ",0
This is n’t “ boys will be boys ,1
"” Actions have consequences , and it ’s hardly unjust to tell a person that if he mistreated another human being like this — even a long time ago — he has to remain “ merely ” a judge on the D.C. ",0
Circuit Court of Appeals ,0
"Since Kavanaugh has denied the story , however , the question of whether the event is so egregious that it should disqualify him is moot ",0
"At the very least , if the attack happened , he should be disqualified for lying ",0
"Yet unless all parties start telling the same story , there is no way to know for certain if this event occurred ",0
"We do n’t need certainty , however , to make a decision on whether a man should sit on the Supreme Court ",0
"I have the same standard for Brett Kavanaugh as I did for Roy Moore , for Donald Trump , for Bill Clinton — or for any other politician who ’s accused of misconduct ",0
Is it more likely than not that the allegation is true ? ,0
"Given the totality of the evidence , I believe it is more likely than not that Bill Clinton committed rape and sexual harassment ",0
I believe it is more likely than not that Donald Trump has committed sexual assault ,0
I believe it is more likely than not that Roy Moore engaged in sexual misconduct with underage girls ,0
But the evidence against Kavanaugh falls far short of the evidence arrayed against each of these men ,0
So far at least it falls far short of the evidence against virtually any other politician or celebrity who has faced consequences during this # MeToo moment ,1
Here ’s why : ,0
"First , one way to help test the veracity of old claims is to ask whether there is any contemporaneous corroboration ",0
Did the accuser tell a friend or family member or anyone about the alleged assault when it occurred ? ,0
"With Clinton , Trump , Moore , and many other politicians and celebrities , there was ample contemporaneous corroboration ",0
"Here , there was not ",0
"According to the Washington Post , “ Ford said she told no one of the incident in any detail until 2012 , when she was in couples therapy with her husband ",0
” ,0
That ’s almost three decades of silence — three decades when memories can grow cloudy and recollections can change ,0
But even the allegedly corroborating notes of the therapist raise a separate problem ,0
They actually contradict her story on a key detail ,0
"According to the Post , “ The notes say four boys were involved , a discrepancy that Ford says was an error on the therapist ’s part ",0
Ford said there were four boys at the party but only two in the room ,0
"” Nor do the notes mention Kavanaugh ’s name , even though her husband says Ford named Kavanaugh in the sessions ",0
"Those are important discrepancies , and if six years ago she told the therapist four men and says two men now , that suggests that her memory of the event may be suspect ",1
"As a former trial lawyer , I can tell you that while neither notes nor memories are infallible , in a contest between contemporaneous notes and later verbal testimony about those notes , the content of the written notes usually prevails ",1
"Juries are extremely skeptical of witnesses who contradict written notes — after all , the notes are taken when the words are immediate and there is n’t the overwhelming pressure of a trial to conform your testimony to the desired outcome ",1
At least the investigation seems somewhat manageable ,0
"If there were only four boys there , who were the other two ? ",0
Let ’s hear from them ,0
"In fact , investigators should interview everyone else at the party ",0
"Yet given all the years that have passed , would it be possible to find anyone who remembers being at that party ? ",0
Would they remember any details at all ? ,0
"If someone saw Kavanaugh stumbling drunk at the party , that would obviously bolster Ford ’s account ",1
"If another attendee says , “ He was totally sober and with me the whole time , ” that helps Kavanaugh ",0
"But the odds of getting details that precise are long indeed , and there is always a chance that a motivated classmate might lie — for either person … ",0
Leaked Doc Reveals White House Planning “ Regime Change ” In Iran ,0
This report was originally published by Tyler Durden at Zero Hedge ,0
It appears Rudy Giuliani was n’t lying ,0
"Just a few days after the former NYC mayor and latest member of President Trump ’s unexpectedly let it slip that “ we got a president who is tough , who does not listen to the people who are naysayers , and a president who is committed to regime change [ in Iran ] ” , the Washington Free Beacon has obtained a three - page white paper being circulated among National Security Council officials with drafted plans to spark regime change in Iran , following the US exit from the Obama - era nuclear deal and the re - imposition of tough sanctions aimed at toppling the Iranian regime ",1
"The plan , authored by the Security Studies Group , or SSG , a national security think - tank that has close ties to senior White House national security officials , including – who else – National Security Adviser John Bolton , seeks to reshape longstanding American foreign policy toward Iran by emphasizing an explicit policy of regime change , something the Obama administration opposed when popular protests gripped Iran in 2009 , writes the Free Beacon , which obtained a leaked copy of the circulating plans ",0
"The regime change plan seeks to fundamentally shift U.S. policy towards Iran and has found a receptive audience in the Trump administration , which has been moving in this direction since Bolton — a longtime and vocal supporter of regime change — entered the White House ",0
"It deemphasizes U.S military intervention , instead focusing on a series of moves to embolden an Iranian population that has increasingly grown angry at the ruling regime for its heavy investments in military adventurism across the region ",0
–Free Beacon ,0
"“ The ordinary people of Iran are suffering under economic stagnation , while the regime ships its wealth abroad to fight its expansionist wars and to pad the bank accounts of the Mullahs and the IRGC command , ” SSG writes in the paper ",0
“ This has provoked noteworthy protests across the country in recent months ” it further claims as an argument to push a “ regime change ” policy ,0
"For now – at least – overthrowing the Iran government , with its extensive and close ties to the Kremlin , is not official US policy ; SSG president Jim Hanson told the Free Beacon that the Trump administration does not want to engage in direct military intervention in Iran – and is instead focusing on other methods of ridding Iran of its “ hardline ruling regime ",0
” ,0
"“ The Trump administration has no desire to roll tanks in an effort to directly topple the Iranian regime , ” Hanson said ",0
“ But they would be much happier dealing with a post - Mullah government ,0
That is the most likely path to a nuclear weapons - free and less dangerous Iran ,0
” ,0
"That will likely change , however ",1
"One source close to the White House who has previewed the plan told the Free Beacon that the nuclear deal , also known as the JCPOA , solidified the Iranian regime ’s grip on power and intentionally prevented the United States from fomenting regime change ",0
"“ The JCPOA purposefully destroyed the carefully created global consensus against the Islamic Republic , ” said the source , who would only speak to the Free Beacon on background about the sensitive issue ",0
"“ Prior to that , everyone understood the dangers of playing footsie with the world ’s largest state sponsor of terrorism ",0
"It ’s now Trump , Bolton , and [ Mike ] Pompeo ’s job to put this consensus back in place ",0
” ,0
The source tells the Beacon that Bolton is “ acutely aware of the danger the Iranian regime poses to the region ,0
” ,0
"“ John is someone who understands the danger of Iran viscerally , and knows that you ’re never going to fundamentally change its behavior — and the threats against Israel and the Saudis especially — until that revolutionary regime is gone , ” the source said , adding that “ nothing ’s off the table right now if Israel is attacked ",0
” ,0
"That said , Bolton is confident that an Iranian regime change will occur in the next six months : ",0

"“ The problem is not the Iran nuclear deal it ’s the Iranian regime , ” said the source ",1
"“ Team Bolton has spent years creating Plans B , C , and D for dealing with that problem ",0

"“ More than one third of Iran ’s population is minority groups , many of whom already seek independence , ” the paper explains ",0

"Without a regime change , the United States will continue face threats from Iranian forces stationed throughout the region , including in Iraq , Yemen , Syria , and Lebanon ",0
"“ The probability the current Iranian theocracy will stop its nuclear program willingly or even under significant pressure is low , ” the plan states ",0
"“ Absent a change in government within Iran , America will face a choice between accepting a nuclear - armed Iran or acting to destroy as much of this capability as possible ",1
” ,1
"That said , President Trump made clear earlier in the week that US officials must make efforts to differentiate between the people of Iran and its ruling regime ",1
"“ Any public discussion of these options , and any messaging about the Iranian regime in general , should make a bright line distinction between the theocratic regime along with its organs of oppression and the general populace , ” according to the plan ",0

Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick 's Scandal ,0
"Archbishop Bernard Hebda of St. Paul , MN , responds to the McCarrick scandal ( The Catholic Spirit ) : ",0
"Every time Mass is celebrated , the priest prays that Jesus will “ look not on our sins but on the faith of [ his ] Church … ",0
"” That ’s been an important prayer for me in the time that I have been serving this archdiocese , well aware of our sins but equally aware of the strong and vibrant faith of this local Church ",0
"I ’ve been praying that prayer even more earnestly in these past weeks as the Church in the United States has once again come face - to - face with its sins , with reports that former cardinal Theodore McCarrick , one of the most prominent Churchmen in the United States in the last quarter century , has been accused of abusing two minors and sexually harassing or assaulting a number of seminarians and young priests ",0
"To make matters worse ( if that is even possible ) , evidence has surfaced that indicates that a bishop , as well as some priests and laity , had brought the allegations about misconduct with seminarians to the attention of Church authorities but to no avail : Archbishop McCarrick was nonetheless “ promoted ” to become the archbishop in our nation ’s capital , and elevated to the College of Cardinals ",1
"While I realize that it is not always easy to evaluate the credibility of those bringing allegations , and that there ’s often a tendency to believe those we know over those we do n’t , I do n’t think that the Church in the United States will rest — and confidence will be restored — until the matter is independently investigated and explained , and assurances are given that there are safeguards in place to make sure that something like this could n’t happen again ",0
"The matter has been particularly troubling to me personally due to the fact that I had served in the Archdiocese of Newark as coadjutor archbishop from November 4 , 2013 , to March 25 , 2016 , when I was named archbishop here ",0
It was while I was in Newark that I was introduced to then - Cardinal McCarrick ,0
"A number of good Catholics have written to ask for a personal accounting on my part , inquiring whether I was made aware in my time in Newark of the 2005 and 2007 settlements involving Archbishop McCarrick , or if I knew of any allegations against him ",0
"I can state unequivocally that I learned of those settlements only in June of this year , as news broke about the unrelated claim that had been filed in the Archdiocese of New York ",0
What I know of the settlements I know from the newspapers ,0
"When serving in Newark , I was regularly briefed on current legal matters of all sorts , but not on past legal matters ( unless they were still being discussed in the press ) ",0
"By the time I arrived in Newark in November 2013 , the 2005 and 2007 settlements were apparently considered ancient history ",0
It would be untrue to state that I had never heard any allegations about Cardinal McCarrick ,0
"Years before I ever lived in Newark , and never imagining that I would be assigned there , I had indeed read — as a somewhat geeky ex - lawyer — an allegation about Cardinal McCarrick in the context of a 2005 lawsuit in the Southern District of New York against Archbishop Myers , Cardinal Eagan , Bishop Hubbard and the Irish Christian Brothers ",0
"While the complaint did n’t supply any details , the plaintiff was reported to have said to a journalist that “ Archbishop McCarrick would share a bed with seminarians but not engage in any activity with them ",0
” The complaint would later be formally amended to include that allegation ,0
"Knowing , however , that this lawsuit was completely dismissed by the state and federal courts , I never gave the particular allegation about Cardinal McCarrick any credence ",0
"I can also state without exception that no one in my years in Newark ever told me that they were improperly touched by Archbishop McCarrick , and no one ever told me that they had to share a bed with him or that they had seen anyone share a bed with him ",0
"I heard lots of gut - wrenching stories in my two - and - a - half years there , but none of them involved Archbishop McCarrick ",1
"With St. John Paul II ’s 1995 visit , he was remembered for “ bringing a saint to Newark , ” not as an abuser of seminarians , minors or priests ",0
"When I was installed here in St. Paul , he joined me at lunch along with my father , sister , godmother and then 12-year - old nephew ",0
I can assure you that I would never have allowed that to happen if I had any reason to know or even suspect the things that have been reported in the newspapers this past month ,0
"While the letters and emails of recent days are sober reminders that there ’s still a long way to go in restoring trust , I nonetheless welcome the efforts to hold me accountable to you , the faithful of this archdiocese ",0
"The events of these past weeks have shown that no one can be above the law , regardless of rank or privilege ",0
"I was grateful for the opportunity to reinforce that with our seminarians this past weekend , and I look forward to continuing my work with the Office of Ministerial Standards and Safe Environment , and our Archdiocesan Review Board , in creating a culture in which no one need be afraid or reluctant to bring forth an allegation of misconduct ",0
"Our heavenly patron , St. Paul , reminds us that “ where sin abounds , grace abounds all the more ",0
” May these difficult days be days of great grace for this local Church ,0
"REMNANT COMMENT : While we certainly appreciate His Excellency 's candid explanation of what he knew and did not know about this horrific scandal in the Church , we would also humbly beg him to take it one step further by publicly proclaiming his profession of belief in the Church 's official teaching against the mortal sin of homosexual acts and the so - called """""""" gay lifestyle , """""""" which includes her long - held teaching that homosexual activity between clerics is an ecclesiastical crime ",1
"Far from being reassured of this by their bishops , many Catholic faithful today are informed that the modern Catholic Church is now an """""""" inclusive community """""""" that """""""" welcomes all """""""" and """""""" judges none ",0
""""""""" ",0
"All very well and good , except for the fact that the Church 's constant and unchanging moral teaching on this makes no such allowance ",0
"In fact , this binding and constant teaching of the Church was reaffirmed most recently in her most authoritative modern catechism , which holds the exact opposite position from that apparently held by many bishops : ",0
"Homosexuality refers to relations between men or between women who experience an exclusive or predominant sexual attraction toward persons of the same sex ... Basing itself on Sacred Scripture , which presents homosexual acts as acts of grave depravity , tradition has always declared that """""""" homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered ",0
""""""""" ",0
They are contrary to the natural law ,0
They close the sexual act to the gift of life ,0
They do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity ,0
Under no circumstances can they be approved ,0
"( Catechism of the Catholic Church , 2357 ) ",0
Under no circumstances … except for those dreamed up by a number of bishops in this country who apparently think that it should be left up to individual parishes to decide if they are LGBTQ - friendly or not ,0
"Even Pope John Paul """""""" The GREAT 's """""""" Vatican clarified the Church 's teaching on October 31 , 1986 , in the “ Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons ” : ",0
"Although the particular inclination of the homosexual person is not a sin , it is a more or less strong tendency ordered toward an intrinsic moral evil ; thus the inclination itself must be seen as an objective disorder ",0
"Therefore special concern and pastoral attention should be directed to those who have this condition , lest they be led to believe that the living out of this orientation in homosexual activity is a morally acceptable option ",0
It is not ,0
"Notice the late pope does not say , “ Let the practicing homosexuals have a spiritual home among your faithful , ” as Father James Martin and his episcopal fans are at least implying on a regular basis in the media ",0
Does Archbishop Hebda believe it is time for the Church to stop humiliating herself by stooping to accommodate a special interest group that obviously does n't care about her or the moral code by which she governs ? ,0
Does he believe that all Catholics must follow the rules of the Church pertaining to the Sixth Commandment ... or just the straight Catholics ? ,0
"Does His Excellency believe that if some homosexual Catholics feel they need not bother following the rules they should be warmly welcomed into our """""""" Catholic Christian """""""" community anyway , even if they are in same - sex unions ? ",0
Pope John Paul certainly did n't accept that ,0
"In his 2005 book Memory and Identity , John Paul referred to homosexuality as an “ ideology of evil , ” insisting of so - called ' gay marriage ' that : ",1
"“ It is legitimate and necessary to ask oneself if this is not perhaps part of a new ideology of evil , perhaps more insidious and hidden , which attempts to pit human rights against the family and man ",0
” ,0
Was Pope John Paul THE GREAT an intolerant homophobe ? ,0
"Are Father Martin and his pals in the episcopacy really so enlightened over every pope , saint , and moral theologian in history ? ",0
"Or is it not so that it is both negligent and uncharitable for some bishops to refuse to inform their faithful that according to the Church 's own infallible teaching , everlasting damnation is the price to be paid for this kind of inclusivity and toleration ? ",1
"And if the episcopal retort is going to be that this acceptance refers only to chaste homosexuals , then we call FOUL even louder since this crosses the line into willful deception ",1
"We 're all sinners , of course--- and the Church already accepts repentant homosexuals as they are , just as she accepts repentant practitioners of ANY sins of the flesh ",0
So why are our bishops playing dumb ? ,1

"It is truly homophobic for any bishop to lie to the gay community about this , and to risk the immortal souls of the sheep merely so that the shepherd might pride himself on occupying the politically correct high ground ",1
"This is gross dereliction of duty , and we hope and pray that all the good U.S. bishops would jump at the opportunity to issue statements reaffirming the Church 's clear teaching against all sins of the flesh , homo- and heterosexual ",1
"Again , God bless Archbishop Hebda for this welcome statement , and may God grant him the courage now to finish the task by publicly reassuring the scandalized faithful that it ’s not just abuse of minors or sexual harassment that ’s going on here ",1
Our bishops must make it absolutely clear that the Church 's moral theology on homosexuality will not and can not be trumped by the dictates of political correctness ,0
"And neither can God 's law be changed to accommodate the spirit of our “ most enlightened ” age --- which is , of course , an evil spirit that can be driven out only by prayer and fasting ",0

"The rescript declares that Pope Francis expressly intends both documents — the papal letter and the episcopal guidelines — to bear the character of his """""""" authentic Magisterium , """""""" and that the pope has personally ordered their publication in AAS and on the Vatican website ",0
"Hence Amoris Laetitia VIII , which proposes that people living in adultery can be guiltless and thus be admitted to the sacraments of Confession and Communion when """""""" concrete circumstances """""""" make it difficult to renounce their adulterous state , is now declared """""""" magisterial """""""" by the Holy See ",0
"The problem with this is that heresy or sacrilege can never be declared magisterial , so that if it is , it not only has no binding force , but the faithful are obliged to resist and refute such a declaration ",0

"Thus , it took more than a year - and - a - half for the Factory to roll out the old reliable “ mistranslation ” defense to explain away the infamous paragraph 303 of Amoris Laetita ( AL ) , which reads as follows in the official English translation on the Vatican website : ",1
Yet conscience can do more than recognize that a given situation does not correspond objectively to the overall demands of the Gospel ,0
"It can also recognize with sincerity and honesty what for now is the most generous response which can be given to God , and come to see with a certain moral security that it is what God himself is asking amid the concrete complexity of one ’s limits , while yet not fully the objective ideal ",0
"In other words , the conscience can “ inform ” a sinner that his continued sinning is not only acceptable to God but is even what God is asking “ for now , ” given one ’s particular “ limits ",0
"” This outrageous proposition , a form of situation ethics that strikes at the very foundation of Catholic moral teaching , has justly provoked a storm of criticism from lay and clerical defenders of the authentic Magisterium ",0
"But it ’s all a misunderstanding , say Dr. Robert Fastiggi , professor of Systematic Theology at Sacred Heart Major Seminary , and Dr. ",0
"Dawn Eden Goldstein , S.T.D. , professor of Dogmatic Theology at Holy Apostles College and Seminary ",0
"All of the critics of AL are wrong — every one of them!—because , you see , the original Latin text does not say what the English text does ",1
Dr. Robert Fastiggi and Dr. ,0
Dawn Goldstein ,0
Here we go again ,0
So what does the Latin say ? ,0
Here is the paragraph in the official Latin : ,0
"Haec autem conscientia agnoscere potest non modo statum quendam ab universali Evangelii mandato obiective dissidere ; etiam sincere honesteque agnoscere poteste quod sit liberale responsum in praesenti Deo reddendum atque eadem conscientia firma quadam morali certitudine intellegere illam esse oblationem quam ipse Deus requirit inter rerum impedientium congeriem , quamvis perfectum nondum sit obiectivum exemplar ",0
"Yes , and so what ? ",0
"Well , according to Fastiggi and Goldstein , while the English translation reads : “ what for now is the most generous response which can be given to God , ” the Latin employs the word oblationem , which means offering ",0
"So , What the Pope Really Means ® is : “ what for now is the most generous offering which can be given to God ",0
"” So , it ’s an offering to God , not a response to God ",0
Big difference ,0
But just a moment : how can objectively immoral behavior ever be characterized as an “ offering ” to God ? ,0
It would seem the Latin version has graver implications than the English because it suggests that falling short of what the moral law requires is an oblation pleasing to God if one ’s “ limits ” make obedience to the moral law difficult ,0
And that is exactly the nonsense Fastiggi and Goldstein expect us to swallow : “ Pope Francis is not talking about an offering of an objectively sinful action but a gift of self that moves toward God and the objective moral norm ,1
” ,0
"So , our intrepid presenters of What the Pope Really Means ® would have us believe that objectively immoral behavior , which is the best one can do according “ the “ concrete complexity of one ’s limits , ” is no longer simply objectively immoral behavior but rather a gift of self because it moves toward morally licit behavior ",1
Fastiggi and Goldstein have managed to make the problem even worse in their attempt to explain it away ,0
"What about the English locution “ while yet not fully the objective ideal , ” which seems to reduce the negative precepts of the natural law to mere ideals ? ",0
"Not so , Fastiggi and Goldstein contend ",0
"Do not all those ignorant critics of AL know that the Latin text employs the phrase “ obiectivum exemplar , ” which , translated literally into English is “ objective exemplar ",1
"” They declare triumphantly : “ The Latin term exemplar does not mean an unattainable ideal , it specifically means a pattern or model to follow ",0
” ,0
Give ,0
Me ,0
A. ,0
Break ,0
"A pattern or model to follow is an ideal , as a standard Latin dictionary confirms with its definition of exemplar : “ ( 1 ) copy / reproduction , ( 2 ) model , pattern , example , original , ideal ",0
"Likewise , the definition of the English word “ exemplar ” is simply : “ an ideal model ",0
” ,0
Here too Fastiggi and Goldsetein only worsen the problem they try to explain away ,0
For if moral behavior is now to be viewed as merely “ exemplary ” rather than divinely mandated by the natural law that binds all men — including Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery — then basic morality becomes a kind of heroic virtue ,0
"Thus , continence can not realistically be expected , at least “ for now ” ( AL 303 ) , of the average Joe or Jane with an “ ex ” who has “ remarried ” and is now mired in the “ concrete complexity one ’s limits ",0
” ,0
"So , as Fastiggi and Goldstein would have it , all the tumult triggered by AL is just a misunderstanding caused by uninformed people who have n’t consulted the Latin text — including those ignorant Vatican translators ",1
"According to their proposed “ alternate translation ” into English , What the Pope Really Means ® is that objectively immoral behavior one feels unable to correct due to one ’s “ limits ” is “ the offering that God himself is asking amid the mass of impediments , although it may not yet be the perfect objective model ",0
” Which is what the official English translation already says but with fewer words ,0
It seems Fastiggi and Goldstein are hoping no one will notice that their linguistic tinkering produces no real change in meaning but only an intensification of its perniciousness ,0
"Indeed , their “ proposed alternate translation ” reduces the avoidance of adulterous relations in “ second marriages ” to the “ perfect objective model ",0
"” Now , how could anyone but a Pharisee expect perfection from people living in adultery ? ",0
Are you perfect ? ,0
"Then again , the Pharisees are precisely the ones Our Lord condemned for accommodating divorce and remarriage in violation of the natural law ",0
But such embarrassing truths need not impede the Bergoglian Mercy Train as it barrels toward a train wreck at the end of the line ,1
"And Fastiggi and Goldstein are busily helping it along , changing red signals to green ",0
No problem here ! ,0
has been the mantra of the neo - Catholic establishment for nearly half a century of ecclesial auto - demolition ,0
"But wait , there ’s more ! ",1
"Our dynamic translators even provide their own dynamic interpretation of AL to mean that the “ offering ” to God of which Francis speaks is merely the decision by a divorced and “ remarried ” couple with children not to end their relationship , which would be the “ perfect objective model , ” but rather to “ live in continence until they may — after the hoped for declaration of nullity — enter into a true marriage ",1
"” That is , they would have Francis affirming John Paul II ’s Familiaris consortio , which repeats the Church ’s constant teaching that continence is required of those who have entered into adulterous “ second marriage , ” failing which they can not be admitted to the sacraments ",0
"But the Fastiggi - Goldstein interpretation is precisely the contrary of the interpretation Francis has assiduously promoted and which Fastiggi and Goldstein just as assiduously ignore : i.e. , that people in “ second marriages ” do not have to live in continence , but rather — in “ certain cases”—may continue their adulterous relations while receiving absolution and Holy Communion during a “ process of discernment ",0
"” As we know , in his letter to the bishops of Buenos Aires , published on the Vatican website ( in response to a query he himself may have solicited ) , Bergoglio informed them “ there is no other interpretation ",0
” ,0
"Moreover , the Maltese bishops ' “ guidelines ” for implementing AL , published in L’Osservatore Romano — for which Bergoglio thanked them — declare thus : ",0
"If , as a result of the process of discernment , undertaken with “ humility , discretion and love for the Church and her teaching , in a sincere search for God ’s will and a desire to make a more perfect response to it ” ( AL 300 ) , a separated or divorced person who is living in a new relationship manages , with an informed and enlightened conscience , to acknowledge and believe that he or she are at peace with God , he or she can not be precluded from participating in the sacraments of Reconciliation and the Eucharist ( see AL , notes 336 and 351 ) ",0
"This Pope ’s plan of promulgating a deliberately ambiguous document whose heterodox interpretation and application he would later approve with a series of sub - magisterial winks and nods , both oral and written , is the reason I signed onto the Correctio Filialis ",0
See the piece by Joseph Shaw in this regard ,0
Shaw maintains that AL can be “ bent into some kind of orthodoxy ,0
” Perhaps ,0
But it is not our responsibility to bend a Pope ’s statements into conformity with the Faith ,0
"Moreover , any Pope who promulgates a document that can be read as orthodox only by a forced interpretation imposed by certain readers — while others disagree — has by that very fact inflicted grave harm upon on the Church , which he alone has the duty to correct ",0
"But Francis , as any reasonable observer can see , has no intention of offering any such correction ",0
"Quite to the contrary , confusion as a cover for the introduction of Holy Communion for “ certain ” public adulterers by Bergoglio ’s co - conspirators in the Vatican and various dioceses is exactly what he was aiming to achieve from the beginning of the whole synodal charade , which was merely a vehicle for promulgation of AL ",1
As Shaw observes of AL : “ What we [ the signers of the Correctio ] are saying is that it has become clear that orthodoxy is not what Pope Francis wants us to find there ,0
” ,0
"In a sense , what Bergoglio is doing is worse than explicit heresy , which could at least be readily identified and denounced as such ",1
"But Bergoglio wants the effects of heresy — undermining Holy Matrimony , Confession and Holy Communion , whose integrity is affirmed verbally — without the guilt of an explicit promulgation ",0
"In so acting , he is very much in the mold of Honorius I , who was posthumously anathematized by an ecumenical council ( the Third Council of Constantinople ) and by his own successor ( Leo II ) for aiding and abetting the spread of the Monothelite heresy ( no human but only a divine will in Christ ) ",0
"Honorius did so by means of private correspondence with the author of the heresy , endorsing the heresy without ever formally proclaiming it as doctrine ",0
And yet Honorius I is listed in the canon of the Popes and is not considered to have fallen from office on account of heresy ,0
"A similar judgment might well befall this Pope , but it is not for us to level it ",0
"Meanwhile , as Fastiggi and Goldstein labor to convince us that nothing is amiss with AL , Pope Bergoglio is sending clear signals of concern about the rising opposition among the faithful to his master plan to subvert the Church according to his false notion of mercy ",0
"In a classic power move , he has just given a sop to Cardinal Burke , the perceived leader of the opposition , by appointing him to a minor position on the Apostolic Signatura — the same tribunal from which Bergoglio brutally removed him as Prefect ",0
"And this after also humiliating Burke as the spiritual patron of the Knights of Malta , to which he was exiled after his removal ",0
"Will this sop buy Burke ’s silence , staving off the feared public correction ? ",0
We will soon know if the Cardinal can be bought so easily ,0
"But this move demonstrates — if more evidence were needed — that Bergoglio has never been the humble apostle of mercy depicted in his carefully crafted public relations narrative , but rather a cunning ecclesiastical politician , constantly plotting and scheming to get what he wants ",1
That the neo - Catholic establishment refuses to recognize the grim reality of this unprecedented pontificate is but another page in the long annals of its shameful defense of the indefensible to the detriment of Holy Mother Church ,1

Barack Hussein Obama Hid Efforts to Aid Iran ’s Windfall ,0
A new Senate report reveals that Barack Obama secretly paved the way for Iran to tap into U.S. banks to convert cash it received from sanctions’ relief to dollars — despite the face the White House assured lawmakers it would do no such thing ,0
The report shows how State Department and Treasury Deparment officials during the Obama era quietly gave a special license for a major Omani bank to do business with two U.S. banks ,0
"Barack Obama spent considerable time selling the American people on the idea of a cooperative Iran — all the while cutting quiet deals , behind closed doors , with the rogue nation ",1

The U.S. banks were pressured into complying with the deal ,0
The Washington Times has more : ,0
"The Obama administration — despite repeatedly assuring Congress that Iran would remain barred from the U.S. financial system — secretly mobilized to give Tehran access to American banks to convert the windfall of cash it received from sanctions relief under the 2015 nuclear deal into dollars , an investigative report by the Senate has revealed ",1
"A copy of the report , obtained by The Washington Times , outlines how Obama - era State and Treasury Department officials discreetly issued a special license for the conversion to a major Omani bank and unsuccessfully pressured two U.S. banks to partake in the transaction , all while misleading lawmakers about the activities ",0
"The document , compiled by the Senate ’s Republican - led chief investigative subcommittee , began circulating Tuesday , just as the Trump administration issued its harshest warnings to date to foreign governments and companies to avoid doing business with Iran or find themselves in the crosshairs of Washington ’s reimposition of sanctions as part of Mr. Trump ’s withdrawal from the nuclear deal ",1
"“ Companies doing business in Iran face substantial risks , and those risks are even greater as we reimpose nuclear - related sanctions , ” said Sigal Mandelker , Treasury Department undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence ",1
She also called on foreign governments to harden their financial systems against “ deceptive ” Iranian transactions that ultimately channel money to terrorists ,0
"The Iranian government “ uses shell and front companies to conceal its tracks ” as part of an elaborate scheme designed to procure cash for the Quds Force of Iran ’s militant Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps , which the U.S. designates as a terrorist organization , Ms. Mandelker said ",0
She issued the warnings in a speech at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank as Iran announced Tuesday that it was formally moving ahead with preparations to increase its nuclear enrichment capacities — the sharpest response to date by the Islamic republic to Mr. Trump ’s pullout from the nuclear accord ,1
"Iranian officials said the increase , while provocative , does not violate its commitments under the nuclear accord ",0
"The president sent shock waves around the world with his May 8 decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear pact and begin reimposing U.S. sanctions , which the U.S. , Europe , China and Russia had collectively lifted in 2015 in exchange for Iran ’s promise to curb its suspect nuclear programs and allow international inspections ",1
"While Iran told the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency on Tuesday that it plans only to increase enrichment within limits set by 2015 deal , the announcement came with threats from a top Iranian official that the activities could be quickly expanded ",1
The warning put fresh pressure on European leaders to keep the nuclear accord alive despite Mr. Trump ’s withdrawal ,1
"The head of Iran ’s nuclear agency , Ali Akbar Salehi , said Tehran is prepared to dramatically increase its capacity for enrichment but that the work so far is limited to building a facility for assembling the centrifuges ",1
"He made the comment a day after Iran ’s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , ordered the increase in capacity and vowed that Iran would preserve its nuclear program despite the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 accord ",0
The Senate report focuses new scrutiny on the lengths President Obama ’s team was willing to go to ensure the deal ’s success as it was still being negotiated ,0
"The Senate Homeland Security Committee ’s permanent subcommittee on investigations probe contends that the Obama administration went out of its way to keep U.S. lawmakers in the dark about calculated and secretive efforts to give Tehran a back channel to the international financial system and to U.S. banks , facilitating a massive U.S. currency conversion worth billions of dollars ",0
"“ Senior U.S. government officials repeatedly testified to Congress that Iranian access to the U.S. financial system was not on the table or part of any deal , ” according to a draft copy of the document obtained by The Times ",0
"“ Despite these claims , the U.S. Department of the Treasury , at the direction of the U.S. State Department , granted a specific license that authorized a conversion of Iranian assets worth billions of U.S. dollars using the U.S. financial system ",0
"“ Even after the specific license was issued , U.S. government officials maintained in congressional testimony that Iran would not be granted access to the U.S. financial system , ” the report said ",0
Sen. ,0
"Rob Portman , the Ohio Republican who chairs the subcommittee , is set to outline his panel ’s findings Wednesday ",0
"Under terms of the nuclear deal , Iran was given the right to reclaim billions of dollars in state assets and bank accounts frozen by international sanctions , but it remained “ illegal for U.S. persons , entities , and financial institutions to do business with Iran or parties on behalf of Iran ",0
” ,0
The ban included any “ intermediary ” transactions by U.S. banks to convert currency for Iran — a development that would have elevated the value of the Iranian assets on the global market and allowed Tehran to more easily move the money through the international banking system ,0
"On the day the nuclear deal was implemented in 2015 , Tehran had some $ 5.7 billion worth of assets at Bank Muscat in Muscat , Oman , according to Senate investigators , who said Tehran moved quickly to request access to the U.S. dollar ",0
"On Tehran ’s request , Bank Muscat contacted the U.S. Treasury Department ’s office of foreign assets control ",0
According to the Senate report : “ Muscat sought to convert $ 5.7 billion in Omai rials into euros ,0
"[ But ] because the rial is pegged to the U.S. dollar , the most efficient conversion was with an intermediary step through a U.S. bank using U.S. dollars ",0
” ,0
"Obama Treasury Secretary Jack Lew told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in July 2015 that Iran would “ continue to be denied access to the [ U.S. ] financial and commercial market ” under the proposed accord , but the Treasury office went ahead with attempts to quietly allow the currency transaction sought by Iran ",0
"“ On February 24 , 2016 , OFAC issued a specific license to Bank Muscat authorizing Iranian assets worth roughly $ 5.7 billion to flow through the U.S. financial system , ” according to the Senate report , which claims the move was made “ even though U.S. sanctions prohibited it ",0
” ,0
"Even as office of foreign assets control officials directly “ encouraged two U.S. correspondent banks to convert the funds , ” the Treasury Department continued to deny it was working to facilitate the currency transaction , said the report , which cites a 2016 letter from the department to Sen. Marco Rubio , Florida Republican , and Sen. Mark Kirk , Illinois Republican , that contended the Obama “ administration has not been and is not planning to grant Iran access to the U.S. financial system ",0
” ,0
"The catch , according to Senate investigators , was that neither of the U.S. banks approached by the office of foreign assets control would take on the Iranian currency exchange — in part because of political concerns over the prospect of being found out to have secretly circumvented the remaining ban on U.S. transactions with the Islamic republic ",0
"Despite the Obama administration ’s efforts , Iran was ultimately forced to convert its Bank Muscat assets to euros in small increments using European banks and without accessing the U.S. financial system , the Senate investigators said ",0
Mr. Portman said in a statement Tuesday night that “ the Obama administration misled the American people and Congress because they were desperate to get a deal with Iran ,1
” ,0
"“ Despite claims both before and after the Iran deal was completed that the U.S. financial system would remain off limits , the Obama administration issued a specific license allowing Iran to convert billions of dollars in assets using the U.S. financial system , ” Mr. Portman said ",0
"“ The only reason this transaction was n’t executed was because two U.S. banks refused , even though the administration asked them to help convert the money ",0
” ,0
"Such sanctions , he added , “ are a vital foreign policy tool , and the U.S. government should never work to actively undermine their enforcement or effectiveness ",0

The Last - Minute Character Assassination of Judge Kavanaugh ,1
"Using any despicable tactic at hand to derail Judge Brett Kavanaugh ’s Supreme Court confirmation less than a week before the Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote on whether to approve his nomination , Senate Democrats have sunk to their lowest level of character assassination yet ",1
They have resorted to peddling an allegation of sexual misconduct against Judge Kavanaugh that supposedly occurred while the judge was in high school ,0
The accuser had refused to identify herself before and during the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings ,0
She conveniently waited until this Sunday to come forward via an on - the - record interview with the Washington Post ,0
"The accuser ’s name is Christine Blasey Ford , a registered Democrat who is currently a California professor teaching clinical psychology ",0
"Judge Kavanaugh issued a statement on Friday in which he said , """""""" I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation ",1
I did not do this back in high school or at any time ,0
""""""""" ",0
Senator Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif ,0
") , the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee that heard Judge Kavanaugh ’s public testimony earlier this month during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing , had received last July a copy of a letter written by the woman making the charge , who we now know was Ms. Ford ",0
"Even though Senator Feinstein had the letter in hand , she never brought up the charge during the public hearing , nor during her own meeting with the judge ",0
"Instead , Senator Feinstein sat on the letter until late last week , when she issued a cryptic release stating that she had received the letter but did not want to give more details in deference to the woman ’s wish to keep the matter confidential ",0
Senator Feinstein turned the letter over to the FBI ,0
The FBI placed the letter in its background file on Judge Kavanaugh but decided not to pursue any further investigation ,0
"Senator Feinstein had initially resisted sharing the contents of the letter with her fellow Democrat members of the Senate Judiciary Committee or to go public with its existence because “ the incident was too distant in the past to merit public discussion ” and she had already “ taken care of it , ” according to a source quoted by The New Yorker ",0
"Nevertheless , Senator Feinstein evidently bowed to pressure from her leftist colleagues to find a way to insert the allegation into the cesspool of public gossip at the eleventh hour ",1
"The New Yorker article , written before Ms. Ford publicly identified herself , provided some details regarding her allegation ",0
"However , now Ms. Ford has decided to do what she called her “ civic responsibility ” and tell her own story publicly ",0
"How convenient , coming just 4 days before the scheduled Senate Judiciary Committee vote ! ",1
"The whole sequence of events surrounding how this allegation has suddenly come to light reeks of a set - up , reminiscent of how Anita Hill surfaced in a last - minute attempt to derail Justice Clarence Thomas 's Supreme Court confirmation ",1
"Christine Blasey Ford claims , according to the Washington Post article , that “ one summer in the early 1980s , Kavanaugh and a friend — both ‘ stumbling drunk,’ Ford alleges — corralled her into a bedroom during a gathering of teenagers at a house in Montgomery County ",1
"While his friend watched , she said , Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed on her back and groped her over her clothes , grinding his body against hers and clumsily attempting to pull off her one - piece bathing suit and the clothing she wore over it ",0
"When she tried to scream , she said , he put his hand over her mouth ",0
"‘ I thought he might inadvertently kill me,’ said Ford ",0
"‘ He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing.’ ” Ms. Ford said she was able to escape the room and go home without any apparent further incident after “ Kavanaugh ’s friend and classmate at Georgetown Preparatory School , Mark Judge , jumped on top of them , sending all three tumbling ",0
” ,0
Here is where Ms. Ford ’s story becomes quite murky and begins to fall apart ,0
"Although Ms. Ford believes the alleged incident occurred during the summer of 1982 , she “ said she does not remember some key details of the incident , ” according to the Washington Post article ",0
"For example , Ms. Ford “ said she does not remember how the gathering came together the night of the incident ",0
” She also does not remember how she got home ,0
"Yet she claims to be absolutely certain that Kavanaugh , whom she presumably knew only as an acquaintance and said she had not spoken to since the night the incident allegedly occurred , was involved in the alleged incident ",0
Ms. Ford admitted that she “ told no one at the time what had happened to her ,0
"” In fact , she said she recalled thinking : “ I ’m not ever telling anyone this ",0
"This is nothing , it did n’t happen , and he did n’t rape me ",0
"” Even if one explains this behavior as the natural reaction of a frightened teenager to a highly traumatic incident , that does not explain why , by her own admission , she “ told no one of the incident in any detail until 2012 , when she was in couples therapy with her husband , ” according to the Washington Post article ",0
"Most revealingly , the article reported on a gaping hole in the therapist ’s notes , portions of which were provided by Ms. Ford for the Washington Post ’s review ",1
The therapist ’s notes “ do not mention Kavanaugh ’s name but say she reported that she was attacked by students ‘ from an elitist boys’ school’ who went on to become ‘ highly respected and high - ranking members of society in Washington.’ ” ,1
"In other words , the only written documentation Ms. Ford has offered in support of her allegation about the incident she said took place while she was in high school – a therapist ’s notes of a couples therapy session occurring 30 years after the alleged incident – did not mention Judge Kavanaugh ’s name ",0
"Judge Kavanaugh has had extensive background checks performed on him in the past for his various federal government positions , including for his current position as a federal appellate court judge , without the accusation ever having surfaced ",0
"Ms. Ford may believe her story to be true , but the lack of any credible corroborating evidence , her partial memory of details surrounding the alleged incident , and the absence of any pattern of such sexual misconduct by Judge Kavanaugh undercut the reliability of her version of the incident ",1
"In a letter addressed to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley ( R - Iowa ) and Senator Feinstein , 65 women who said they knew Judge Kavanaugh in high school vouched for his character : ",0
We are women who have known Brett Kavanaugh for more than 35 years and knew him while he attended high school between 1979 and 1983 ,0
"For the entire time we have known Brett Kavanaugh , he has behaved honorably and treated women with respect … Brett attended Georgetown Prep , an all - boys high school in Rockville , Maryland ",1
He was an outstanding student and athlete with a wide circle of friends ,0
Almost all of us attended all - girls high schools in the area ,0
"We knew Brett well through social events , sports , church , and various other activities ",0
Many of us have remained close friends with him and his family over the years ,0
"Through the more than 35 years we have known him , Brett has stood out for his friendship , character , and integrity ",0
"In particular , he has always treated women with decency and respect ",0
"That was true when he was in high school , and it has remained true to this day ",0
The signers of this letter hold a broad range of political views ,0
"Many of us are not lawyers , but we know Brett Kavanaugh as a person ",0
And he has always been a good person ,0
"Nevertheless , using their standard contemptible , obstructionist tactics , the Democrats opposed to Judge Kavanaugh happily seized on the unsubstantiated allegation of teen sexual misbehavior in high school to assassinate Judge Kavanaugh ’s character ",1
"They have done so in the face of Judge Kavanaugh ’s lifetime record of stellar public service , multiple background checks producing no evidence of sexual misconduct , and the letter written by the 65 women , who knew him when he was in high school and thereafter and who signed their names to a ringing endorsement of his good character ",0
Feminists gave the serial sexual predator Bill Clinton a free pass because his policies were in line with their ideology ,1
"Senator Feinstein called Ted “ Chappaquiddick ” Kennedy an """""""" inspiration and a friend , """""""" presumably also based on their compatible ideologies ",1
"Hypocritically exploiting an unsubstantiated allegation of decades - old purported teenage sexual mischief , Democrats seeking to torpedo Judge Kavanaugh ’s Supreme Court confirmation for ideological reasons have debased themselves with a shameless smear campaign against an eminently qualified candidate for the Supreme Court ",1
"Predictably , Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer ( D - N.Y. ) and other Democrats , including Senator Feinstein , have called for the Senate to postpone a vote on Judge Kavanaugh ",0
""""""""" Senator Grassley must postpone the vote until , at a very minimum , these serious and credible allegations are thoroughly investigated , ” Senator Schumer said ",0
"If a thorough investigation was considered to be so important , why did n't Senator Feinstein set the ball rolling back in July when she first received word of the allegation ? ",1
The answer is that this is all a ruse to block Judge Kavanaugh 's confirmation by all means necessary ,1
"Senator Schumer is fulfilling his promise to oppose Judge Kavanaugh with """""""" everything I 've got ",0
""""""""" ",0
"As of now , the Senate Judiciary Committee Republican majority plans to move forward with Judge Kavanaugh 's nomination as scheduled ",0
It is time for the Democrat obstructionists to slink back into their shadowy corner ,1
No sign of breakthrough after Pompeo meets with Saudi rulers over missing journalist ,0
"WASHINGTON — On an emergency mission to resolve a diplomatic crisis , Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo held delicate talks Tuesday with the rulers of Saudi Arabia amid growing suspicions that a Virginia - based Saudi columnist was killed on their orders ",1
"Pompeo did not report any progress following a day of meetings in Riyadh with Saudi King Salman and his powerful son , Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman , the country ’s de facto ruler ",0
"President Donald Trump on Monday ordered Pompeo to rush to the desert kingdom to try to determine the fate of the missing journalist , Jamal Khashoggi , and the diplomat quickly hopped a plane ",1
"In his meetings , Pompeo conveyed “ U.S. ",0
"concern ” about Khashoggi ’s disappearance two weeks ago , the State Department said , and stressed “ the importance of a thorough , transparent , and timely investigation ",0
” ,0
"The talks were “ direct and candid , ” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said ",0
"Pompeo reminded his hosts that despite the numerous bilateral issues the two governments share , determining Khashoggi ’s fate was the urgent purpose of this trip , she said ",0
"Khashoggi , a prominent critic of the autocratic Saudi leadership , was last seen entering the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul , Turkey , on Oct. 2 , where he was seeking papers to marry his fiancée ",0
"Turkish media reports , based in part on apparent audio recordings , have said Khashoggi was beaten to death and then dismembered in the building ",1
"A 15-member Saudi military team had entered the consulate with a bone saw shortly before Khashoggi arrived , and flew out of the country soon after , the reports said ",0
Saudi officials insisted that Khashoggi left the consulate but have provided no video or other evidence ,0
They have denied any responsibility for his disappearance ,0
"Hoping to stem a growing furor , Trump on Monday suggested “ rogue killers , ” not the Saudi royal family , may have carried out the murder ",0
"Critics quickly said that Trump was providing an excuse for the Saudi leaders , and participating in a cover - up ",0
That seemed to set the stage for Saudi officials to find a way to explain away the alleged shocking death ,1
"They floated the idea later Monday of claiming that Khashoggi , who wrote opinion pieces for the Washington Post and Arab media , was accidentally killed in an interrogation gone awry inside the consulate — supposedly without the approval of the king or crown prince ",0
"Publicly , Pompeo and his hosts looked calm and friendly when they met Tuesday in Riyadh ",0
"At one point , as they greeted each other , Prince Mohammed noted the two countries were important allies ",0
"“ Absolutely , ” Pompeo said , smiling ",0
The United States long guaranteed Saudi security in exchange for a steady supply of oil ,0
Those ties have frayed even as the Trump administration has embraced the Saudi rulers as a crucial regional ally in efforts to constrain Iran and to craft a peace plan between Israel and the Palestinians ,0
"The current crisis has put those broader goals at risk , and the White House has scrambled to find a face - saving solution for the Saudi rulers ",0
"Trump has said he would impose “ severe ” punishment if proof emerges that Saudi rulers sanctioned Khashoggi ’s murder , but he has not said what that would entail ",1
He has ruled out cancelling or suspending billions of dollars in arms deals with the oil - rich country ,0
"Many members of Congress have demanded the White House take tougher actions , including punitive sanctions on Saudi rulers ",0
But Congress has taken no action on its own ,0

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban Calls For Global Anti - Migrant Alliance ,0
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban who has been at the forefront in Europe in standing against illegal immigration and the invasion of Muslims into his country has called for a global alliance to stand against the migrant invasion ,1
"Viktor Orban , who openly professes the Reformed faith of Christianity , told an audience at the Royal Castle in Budapest , “ Christianity is Europe ’s last hope ",1
” ,1
"He continued by stating that mass immigration , especially from Africa , “ our worst nightmares can come true ",1
The West falls as it fails to see Europe being overrun ,1
” ,1
Reuters reports : ,0
Hungarian leader Viktor Orban called on Sunday for a global alliance against migration as his right - wing populist Fidesz party began campaigning for an April 8 election in which it is expected to win a third consecutive landslide victory ,0
"Popular at home but increasingly at odds politically and economically with mainstream European Union peers , Orban has thrived on external controversy , including repeated clashes with Brussels and lately the United Nations ",0
"Those conflicts , mostly centered on migration since people fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and Africa flooded into Europe in 2015 , have intensified as the elections approach and Orban poses as a savior of Europe ’s Christian nations ",1
"One thing to note is that Christianity is not Europe 's """""""" last hope , """""""" it 's the world 's """""""" only hope ",1
""""""""" ",1
"In speaking of the influx of Muslim migrants into Europe , Orban sees it as destroying the culture of Europe and referred to it as an “ immigrant zone , a mixed population world that heads in a direction different from ours ",1
” ,0
Orban then called out the traitors in the midst of Europe who want to push Hungary to accept Muslim invaders ,1
"“ Absurd as it may sound the danger we face comes from the West , from politicians in Brussels , Berlin and Paris , ” he told the crowd to applause ",0
"“ Of course we will fight , and use ever stronger legal tools ",0
The first is our ‘ Stop Soros’ law ,1
” ,0
"Orban has seen the influence of George Soros and his organizations in Hungary and has openly criticized it and Soros , calling Soros a """""""" public enemy ",1
""""""""" ",0
"He also said that Soros has """""""" ruined """""""" millions of lives via his """""""" mafia network ",1
""""""""" ",0
Reuters adds : ,0
"Soros , for his part , compared Orban unfavorably to both the Nazis and the Communists , saying his rule evoked dark tones from the 1930 ’s — when Hungary was allied with Nazi Germany — and was more oppressive than Cold War Soviet occupation ",1
"Orban has tightened the screws on non - government organizations , particularly ones funded by Soros , and attempted to close a prominent Soros - founded university ",0
"Attributing to Soros a recent United Nations plan on creating a global blueprint to handle the migration crisis , Orban said he anticipated that powerful allies would help him prevent the U.N. from greasing the wheels of migration ",0
"“ Soros has antagonized not only us but also England , President Trump and Israel too , ” Orban said ",0

Pilger Excoriates Media ,0
"DB : John , what is the latest we know about how Julian Assange is being treated and his current state ? ",0
"John Pilger : His state of health is just about the same , as I understand it ",0
"He needs medical attention , the kind of treatment you get only in a hospital ",0
But it has been made clear to him that if he attempts to go to a hospital he will not be given free passage and he will be arrested ,0
"Since he was arrested in 2010 , Assange has not been charged with a single crime ",0
His treatment amounts to the most unprecedented persecution ,1
"Julian could leave the embassy if his own government , the government of his homeland , Australia , applied legitimate diplomatic pressure on behalf of its citizen ",1
We must ask ourselves why this has n’t happened ,1
"My own feeling is that there is a great deal of collusion between the Australian , the British and the US governments – meant to close down WikiLeaks completely and/or deliver Julian Assange to the Americans ",0
"Recently the Australian foreign minister , Julie Bishop , traveled with senior officials to London and to Washington and raised the whole matter of Julian ",0
But they raised it in a way that did n’t support the idea that a government should represent its citizens ,0
These people listened to the more powerful governments ,0
"In Washington they met Mr. Pompeo , who refused to discuss Assange altogether ",0
I think there is collusion which amounts to an attempt to try to do a deal with Assange whereby he might be allowed free passage of return to Australia if he shuts down WikiLeaks ,0
"I think that is very , very likely ",0
"As I understand Julian , this is something he would not even contemplate ",1
But that might be one of the so - called “ wretched deals ” that are being offered Assange ,1
Some very strange things are being said by senior members of these two governments ,0
"The new foreign secretary of the United Kingdom , Jeremy Hunt , said sarcastically that the British police would offer Julian “ a warm welcome ” when he came out , when he would face serious charges ",1
There are no serious charges ,0
He has n’t been charged with anything ,0

Was Hunt referring to a deal which has already been done with the United States on extradition ? ,0
I do n’t know ,0
But this is the milieu of machination around someone who has the right of natural justice concerning his freedom ,1
"Putting aside freedom of speech , the persecution of this man has been something that should horrify all free - thinking people ",1
"If it does n’t horrify us , then we have surrendered something very valuable ",1
DB : Among those who should be especially horrified are those of us in the journalistic community ,1
"John , I would like you to explain once again why Julian Assange is such a significant journalist , why so many journalistic institutions have collaborated with him based on the information he provided ",1
We are talking about a publisher and reporter who has changed history ,1
JP : Nothing in my time as a journalist has equaled the rise of WikiLeaks and its extraordinary impact on journalism ,1
It is probably the only journalistic organization that has a 100 % record of accuracy and authenticity ! ,1
All of WikiLeaks’ revelations have been authentic ,0
And it has been done “ without fear or favor ,0
"” Although there has been a concentration on , say , the release of the Hillary Clinton / Podesta emails , or the Iraq and Afghan war logs , WikiLeaks has released information that people have a right to know across the spectrum ",0
"It has released something like 800,000 documents from Russia , and now WikiLeaks is accused of being an agent of Russia ! ",0
WikiLeaks’ journalism has covered a universal space and that is the first time this has happened ,0
"In Tunisia , the release of WikiLeaks documents foretold the Arab Spring ",0
The people at the forefront of the uprising in Tunisia credit WikiLeaks for informing them of what their repressive government was doing behind their backs ,0
"In Venezuela , WikiLeaks released cables which described in great detail how the United States intended to subvert the government of Hugo Chavez ",0
"Some of this was published in the mainstream media , when there was still a collaboration with WikiLeaks ",0
"The Clinton / Podesta emails , which appear to have made a number of people resentful , were published in the New York Times ",0
These emails showed the close role that Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation played in support of extreme jihadism in the Middle East ,1
That was a very important piece of information for people to know and understand ,0
"By doing that , WikiLeaks performed an extraordinary public service , while at the same time making some very serious enemies ",1
"Randy Credico : People sometimes forget that , apart from being a journalist , Julian Assange is a human being ",0
You have known him a long time ,0
Could you give us a feel for the kind of person Julian Assange is ? ,0
JP : Julian is a very principled individual ,1
He feels very strongly about the moral basis of WikiLeaks ,0
"When he first put up WikiLeaks , he wrote that the whole idea of transparency , honoring people ’s right to know , was the central aim of the website ",0
He feels that very strongly ,0
Any attempt to do a deal with Julian to shut down WikiLeaks will no doubt be resisted ,0
"As a person , Julian is an extremely interesting man ",1
He is very well read ,0
He studied physics ,0
"He has a very good sense of humor , and I have often laughed out loud with him about situations that others might consider too bleak to discuss ",0
His black humor is a part of his survival kit ,0
"Obviously , he is incredibly resilient ",0
"Personally , I could never endure what he has , especially in recent years ",0
But this comes with a cost and his health is continuing to deteriorate ,0
Those close to him are extremely worried ,1
Cypherpunks : Freedom a ... Julian Assange Best Price : $ 3.04 Buy New $ 9.55 ( as of 06:45 EDT - Details ) ,0
"In a letter to the Australian prime minister , Malcolm Turnbull , Julian ’s father , John Shipton , wrote : “ I ask the prime minister to do all within his power to return Julian home before Julian ’s situation becomes an irreversible tragedy ",1
” That is why this is such an urgent case of justice toward a single human being as well as a case of a journalistic organization ’s right to function and our right to have the information it provides ,0
"Only seven years ago , the current prime minister said that when an Australian citizen is threatened in this way the prime minister should respond ",0
That was Turnbull before he became prime minister ,0
Now the government is playing its usual role of being the fifty - first state of the United States ,1
It is a true disgrace ,1
RC : What about Theresa May and the British government ? ,1
Are they getting pressure from the United States or are there internal reasons why they want to keep Julian Assange quiet ? ,1
JP : Everything comes down to the relationship with the United States ,0
"Australia has an almost totally servile relationship with America , in which its national security structure , much of its academic life and certainly much of its media is integrated into the US system ",1
That is not entirely the case in Britain ,0
"Since the loss of its empire after the Second World War , Britain has been eager to play a secondary role to the new imperial power ",0
"In many parts of the world , Britain is still the biggest corporate investor ",0
But it does move in lockstep with the US on much of its foreign policy ,1
It is interesting to see the corruption that this kind of relationship produces ,0
Information has come out that the Crown Prosecution Service tried to prevent the Swedes from giving up the case against Julian on bogus sexual assault charges ,1
The pressure was on from London to keep it going ,0
Julian is also seen as defying a system and that is just not acceptable ,0
There is a real element of vindictiveness here ,0
The Crown Prosecution Service kept this case going when otherwise the European warrant put out by the Swedes would have been abandoned in 2013 ,0
"When Julian came up to a bail hearing last year , it was an absolute disgrace ",1
The judge described Julian ’s circumstances as if he were on some sort of extended vacation ,0
What did n’t emerge was the whole conflict of interest in this hearing ,1
The judge ’s husband is a figure deep within the national security establishment in Britain who was named in WikiLeaks documents ,1
"Because there is no serious media examining the whole WikiLeaks witch hunt , virtually none of this emerges ",1
"DB : The corporate press has a major responsibility if Julian Assange goes down , do n’t you agree ? ",0
"JP : As you know , Dennis , governments do respond to pressure from powerful media interests ",0
It rarely happens but when it does governments do change their tune ,0
"There has been no pressure from media in the United States , Britain , Australia or pretty much anywhere except in programs like yours outside the mainstream ",0
You are absolutely right in that the responsibility of journalists for what has happened to Julian Assange and what might happen to WikiLeaks is undeniable ,1
I was looking this morning at a report by Media Lens in Britain describing how the British press has reported on Julian Assange ,0
"It describes the tsunami of vindictive personal abuse that has been heaped upon Julian from well - known journalists , many claiming liberal credentials ",1
"The Guardian , which used to consider itself the most enlightened newspaper in the country , has probably been the worst ",1
The frontal attacks have been coming not from governments but from journalists ,0
"I described this recently as “ Vichy journalism , ” a term which now fits so much of the mainstream media ",1
It collaborates in the same way that the Vichy government in France collaborated with the Nazis ,1
"The WikiLeaks Files : T ... WikiLeaks Best Price : $ 2.75 Buy New $ 7.00 ( as of 12:00 EDT - Details ) There used to be spaces within the so - called mainstream for unbiased discussion , for the airing of real grievances and injustices ",0
These spaces have closed completely ,0
The attacks on Julian Assange illustrate what has happened to the so - called free media in the West ,0
"I have been a journalist for a very long time and I have always worked within the mainstream , but the journalism I see now is part of a rapacious establishment and one of its prime targets is Julian Assange and WikiLeaks ",1
This is precisely because WikiLeaks is producing the kind of journalism that they ought to be doing ,1
"WikiLeaks has in fact shamed journalists , which might help to explain the deeply personal abuse he has suffered ",1
WikiLeaks has revealed what journalists should have revealed a long time ago ,0
"DB : Even the attorney for the New York Times happened to mention that if Julian Assange gets prosecuted , the Times could get prosecuted under the same laws ",0
"JP : It could but I do n’t believe it would be , because power respects power ",1
The New York Times is part of the establishment ,0
The difference with WikiLeaks is that it is outside of the establishment and is truly independent ,0
DB : What would be your strongest plea for Julian Assange ? ,0
JP : It ’s very simple ,0
This is about justice ,0
"In a famous speech given in the 1930 ’s by Parson Martin Niemoller , he said that first the Nazis came for socialists , but he did n’t speak up because that did n’t concern him ",0
"Then they came for trade unionists , but he did n’t speak up because that did n’t concern him ",0
He did n’t speak up when they came for the Jews because he was n’t a Jew ,0
"And , of course , finally they came for him ",0
"That might not be a precise parallel , but if Julian Assange is allowed to literally go under , it represents the conquest of all of us ",1
It means that we have kept quiet ,0
Keeping quiet has allowed the great atrocities of histories to take place ,1
"If Julian is allowed to be spirited away to some super - max hellhole , it will be a great atrocity ",1
"DB : In the library , silence is golden ",1
"In the world of human rights , silence equals mass murder ",1
They say you should n’t yell fire in a crowded theater just to get a reaction ,0
"But if you know the theater is in fact on fire and you do not shout out , what happens after is your responsibility ",1

The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event ,0
"Daniel Greenfield , a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center , is an investigative journalist and writer focusing on the radical left and Islamic terrorism ",0
The American Jewish Historical Society was founded to study and preserve Jewish history ,0
These days it ’s instead partnering with Jewish Voice for Peace : an anti - Israel BDS hate group that defends anti - Semitism and which sponsored talks by an anti - Semite who accused Jews of drinking blood ,1
The fruits of the AJHS and JVP partnership have been a series of events attacking Israel ,0
Coming up in late October is “ The Balfour Declaration : Support for a Jewish Homeland or Jewish State ? ” ,0
"The two speakers are Robert Herbst , the coordinator of the Westchester chapter of JVP , and Jonathan Kuttab , who advocates a one - state solution for eliminating Israel ",0
"He had tweeted , """""""" EU no longer considers # Hamas a terrorist group ",1
Time for US to do same ,1
""""""""" ",1
Kuttab has defended Islamic anti - Semitism by claiming that the “ distrust Moslems feel towards Jews ” is due to “ two acts of betrayal by Jewish tribes against the Prophet ,0
” And that Jews suffer from a “ Holocaust Syndrome ” of entitlement ,1
"He justified hijacking planes , described suicide bombers as “ taking the supreme sacrifice ” and defended Hezbollah as “ an armed - resistance movement ” ",1
"He has claimed that the """""""" Jewish community gradually consolidated its power , wealth , and influence in all sectors of society """""""" especially in """""""" crucial sectors like banking , finance , media ” where """""""" their influence both as individuals and an organized community far exceeded their numbers """""""" and that their power strengthens “ conspiracy theories about ‘ Jewish control’ that are reminiscent of the infamous “ ’Protocols of the Elders of Zion.’ ” ",0
Robert Herbst and Jonathan Kuttab are both supporters of a one - state plan for eliminating Israel ,0
"The American Jewish Historical Society is co - sponsoring a JVP anti - Israel event by two opponents of Israel , one of whom has defended Hamas ",0
"An organization that hands out the Emma Lazarus Award , named after a passionate Zionist , at its posh dinners is hosting attacks on the existence of Israel ",0
"The “ Jewish Homeland ” or “ Jewish State ” argument is a hook for contending that the Balfour Declaration did n’t endorse Israel , but some sort of Jewish Bantustan within a Muslim country ",0
That worked so well for the Christians and Jews of the Middle East ,0
The American Jewish Historical Society is not only co - sponsoring a one - state event by an anti - Israel hate group ,0
But it ’s also hosting it at the Center for Jewish History ’s headquarters ,0
AJHS is a component of the Center for Jewish History ,0
"And the partnership between AJHS and JVP sheds light on the controversy over the appointment of David N. Myers , an anti - Israel activist , to head the Center for Jewish History ",0
"During the Myers controversy , the Center took pains to disassociate Myers and themselves from JVP because a JVP handout had listed him as a “ JVP Academic Advisory Board Member ",0
"” But in reality the Center , through AJHS , has an ongoing relationship with JVP ",0
The Balfour event was not AJHS’ only partnership with JVP ,0
"In December , the AJHS will feature “ Rubble Rubble ” , a play by Dan Fishback based on his trip to Israel ",0
Fishback is a BDS supporter and a member of the JVP Artists Council ,0
His goal is to “ normalize Jewish anti - Zionism ” ,0
AJHS and JVP members get discounted admission ,0
The venue is once again the Center for Jewish History ,0
Specifically the Leo and Julia Forchheimer Auditorium at CJH ,0
Leo Forchheimer ’s philanthropy had left its mark on Israel ,0
What would he think if he knew the anti - Israel purposes that CJH is putting his gift to ? ,0
"A third AJHS - JVP event featured Efrat Yerday , an anti - Israel activist , accusing Israel of racism ",1
"Efrat has claimed that , """""""" Zionism does not only dispossess Palestinians , but it also dispossesses in a very sophisticated way , non - white Jews ",1
Being Jewish is highly identified with being white because of Zionism ,1
""""""""" ",0
AJHS will claim that it is only offering different perspectives ,0
"But when it comes to Israel , there ’s only one perspective ",0
“ Balfour ” and “ Rubble Rubble ” are to be part of AJHS’ “ 1917 : How One Year Changed the World ” ,0
"The exhibition is supposed to cover WWI , the Bolshevik Revolution , and the Balfour Declaration ",0
But the only Balfour program on the list questions whether Israel should even exist ,0
The exhibition closes with Fishback ’s anti - Israel agenda ,0
And these are the only listed AJHS programs that focus on Israel ,0
JVP is also the only organization that AJHS chooses to partner with on political events ,0
The American Jewish Historical Society appears to be uninterested in holding any pro - Israel events ,0
It ’s uninterested in partnering with pro - Israel groups ,0
Instead it ’s providing a forum for a BDS hate group ,0
And it ’s no mystery why ,0
The AJHS Academic Council is packed with anti - Israel activists ,0
"Lila Corwin - Berman , the chair of the AJHS Academic Council who also serves on its board of trustees , is a member of the Open Hillel Academic Council ",0
"Open Hillel seeks to """""""" open """""""" the campus group to BDS and other anti - Israel views ",0
"Berman has defended the anti - Israel hate group IfNotNow , which employs JVP tactics , and condemned efforts to fight BDS ",0
She signed a petition in support of BDS activists being allowed to enter Israel ,0
"Other AJHS Academic Council members who signed the pro - BDS activist petition include Ari Kelman , Riv - Ellen Prell , Deborah Dash Moore , Rachel Kranson , Libby Garland and Kirsten Fermaglich ",0
"When we look at what is going on in CJH ’s components like the AJHS , the elevation of David N. Myers to head CJH is unsurprising ",0
Myers is a symptom of the problem ,0
As is AJHS ’s partnership with JVP ,0
A great deal of shocking behavior is taking place inside Jewish organizations whose inner workings most people in the Jewish community generally pay very little attention to ,0
"Unlike CJH , the American Jewish Historical Society is an organization that dates back to the 19th century ",0
Its perversion by the radical anti - Jewish and anti - Israel left to serve anti - Semitic narratives is tragic ,1
And yet it ’s inescapable ,0
"Even as the Myers scandal continues to simmer , the AJHS partnership with JVP is making the choice painfully clear ",1
The radical anti - Israel left will not be satisfied with embedding “ moderate ” opposing voices into Jewish organizations ,0
Instead it seeks to normalize the furthest extremes of anti - Israel hatred ,0
And it will not be satisfied with anything less ,0
"During the Myers controversy , defenders of his appointment , including some figures named here , claimed that it was an issue of apolitical scholarship ",0
Is co - sponsoring events with a hate group that has sponsored talks by a woman who accused Jews of drinking blood also apolitical scholarship ? ,1
The anti - Israel leftists at the AJHS are clearly not leaving their politics at home ,0
And support for them and for Myers can not be distinguished from support for their views ,0
Not when JVP is at AJHS ,0
We all have choices to make ,1
Sometimes the choices are murky ,0
Other times they are simple and easy ,0
"When the American Jewish Historical Society hosts and co - sponsors an event by a BDS hate group attacking the existence of Israel and featuring a speaker who had defended terrorism and anti - Semitism , the choice becomes easy ",0
"Either you stand with BDS , Hamas , blood libels and those who want to destroy Israel or with Jews ",1
"As the anti - Israel radicalism of the left grows , such choices will become even more obscenely simple ",0
But they will not be any less difficult ,0
Opposing the anti - Israel left makes many important enemies and wins few friends ,0
"The anti - Israel left has built networks that can blacklist , smear and silence almost anyone in an academic field ",0
Speaking out against hate is easiest when it ’s weakest ,0
It ’s hardest when it ’s strongest ,0
"When we think about Nazi Germany , we remember those who spoke out ",0
We do n’t remember those who were too intimidated and uncertain to rise against anti - Semitism when they saw it and heard it ,0
History tells us why so many people are afraid to do the right thing when it counts ,0
It also tells us how irrelevant history makes them ,0
"There are lessons here for the Center for Jewish History and the American Jewish Historical Society , for those on the inside who see the corruption of their organizations every day and for those on the outside who are worried about speaking up ",0
There are lessons here for all of us ,0
"If you ca n’t speak out against the American Jewish Historical Society ’s partnership with a hate group linked to a literal blood libels and a speaker who defends Hamas , when will your voice be heard ? ",0

"Members of the Pope 's own Commission for the Protection of Minors , set up in 2014 as part of efforts to counter sex abuse by clergy , have told the Associated Press they hand - delivered the letter to Francis 's top adviser on sex abuse , Cardinal Sean O'Malley , in April 2015 ",0

The JFK Cover - Up Continues ,0
"While the mainstream media was announcing for the past two weeks that President Trump was going to release the CIA ’s long - secret records on the JFK assassination , I took a different position ",0
"On Monday of this week , I predicted that Trump would make a deal with the CIA that would enable the CIA to continue its cover - up of the JFK assassination ",0
( See “ I Predict Trump Will Continue the CIA ’s JFK Assassination Cover - Up ” and “ No Smoking Guns in the JFK Records ? ” ) ,0
"On Thursday , the day of the deadline established by law for releasing the records , Trump granted the CIA ’s request for continued secrecy , on grounds of “ national security , ” more than 50 years after the Kennedy assassination ",0
"Please , do n’t start calling me Nostradamus ",0
A blind man could see what was happening ,1
"Donald “ Art of the Deal ” Trump was obviously negotiating all week with the CIA , and he was obviously pushing to get what he wanted all the way up to the very last day ",1
"On Thursday , the deadline established by law for releasing the records , the CIA undoubtedly blinked and Trump presumably got what he wanted in return for granting the CIA request for continued secrecy ",0

The fact is that the CIA put in its request to Trump for continued secrecy of its JFK records long before yesterday ,0
"But “ Art of the Deal ” Trump obviously sat on the request , undoubtedly hoping that he could get what he wanted in return if he just continued holding out and conveying that he was ready to release the records ",1
"Do n’t forget : According to Trump ’s own tweets , he had already ostensibly decided to deny the CIA ’s request for secrecy before the Thursday deadline : ",0
"Trump tweet sent on Saturday , October 21 : “ Subject to the receipt of further information , I will be allowing , as President , the long blocked and classified JFK FILES to be opened ",0
"” Trump tweet sent on Wednesday , October 25 : “ The long anticipated release of the # JFKFiles will take place tomorrow ",0
So interesting ! ,1
"Now , it ’s theoretically possible that the CIA presented Trump with some earthshattering new information on the Thursday deadline that showed that the United States would fall into the ocean if Americans were finally permitted to see the CIA ’s long - secret JFK records ",1
But how likely is that ? ,1
Not likely at all ! ,0
"Instead , it is a virtual certainly that when Art of the Deal Trump sent out those two tweets , he was sending a message to the CIA as part of the negotiations : Give me what I want or I will release the records ",1
"In the negotiations , both Trump and the CIA knew that Trump was in the catbird seat ",0
The Kennedy Autopsy Jacob Hornberger Check Amazon for Pricing ,0
"In the end , the CIA blinked , just as Trump knew it would ",0
"Contrary to what the mainstream press is asserting , the records undoubtedly contain more incriminating circumstantial evidence that fills in the mosaic of a U.S. national - security regime - change operation on November 22 , 1963 ",1
"That ’s what the mainstream media , forever wedded to the official story no matter how ridiculous and illogical it is , simply can not bring themselves to confront ",1
Trump knew that he had the CIA over a barrel ,0
"As I indicated in my two articles this week , the CIA was between a rock and a hard place ",0
"On the one hand , it could refuse to grant Trump what he wanted and let the records be released , which it knew would point to the CIA ’s guilt in the assassination ",1
"On the other hand , it could give Trump what he wanted and have to suffer the obvious inference that people would draw — that the CIA was continuing to cover up incriminatory evidence ",1
What did the CIA give Trump in return for Trump ’s extending the CIA ’s 50-year - plus secrecy ? ,0
"We do n’t know , but my hunch is that it pertains to Russia ",0
Here ’s my next prediction : the congressional investigations into Trump ’s supposed “ collusion ” with Russia are about to fizzle out ,0
"That ’s because I believe that the CIA , as part of its deal with Trump , will order its assets in Congress to cease and desist with respect to that investigation ",0
"In my opinion , that ’s the price the CIA had to pay in return for its continued cover - up of its U.S. regime - change operation in November 1963 ",0
Notice something else about the deal that Trump has presumably made with the CIA : The secrecy arrangement extends only to April ,0
"Ostensibly , the next six months are needed to carefully review the records to determine whether the records really to relate to “ national security ",0

"Not surprisingly , the mainstream media is n’t even questioning that ludicrous notion ",1
"For more than 50 years , the CIA has known why it has wanted those particular records to be kept secret ",0
"During the term of the Assassination Records Review Board in the 1990s , the CIA decided to keep these particular records secret for another 25 years ",0
There are bound to be lots of CIA memoranda detailing why it was imperative to keep these particular records secret for as long as possible ,0
"Finally , the CIA made its request for secrecy to Trump at least several weeks ago ",0
"The notion that the CIA suddenly hit Trump yesterday with a new argument as to why “ national security ” would be threatened , after Trump had supposedly already rejected the arguments that had been presented to him , causing Trump to suddenly change his mind , is , well , laughable ",1
"So , why the April deadline ? ",0
"Why not extend the secrecy for another 25 years , which is undoubtedly what the CIA wanted ? ",0
Because Trump obviously needed collateral to ensure that the CIA complied with its part of the deal ,0
"If Trump had extended the secrecy for 25 years , he would have lost leverage to ensure that the CIA complied with its part of the bargain ",0
"Let ’s say , hypothetically , that I ’m right : that the CIA agreed to use its assets in Congress to shut down the Russia investigation ",0
"To make certain that the CIA fulfills its part of the bargain , Trump would need the April deadline so that the threat of the records release would continue hanging over the CIA ",0
"If the CIA fails to fulfill its part of the bargain , Trump releases the records in April ",0
"If the CIA squelches the Russia investigations , Trump grants another extension of time in April ",0
Let ’s state the obvious : The CIA records that are still being suppressed have nothing to do with “ national security ,1
"” They have everything to do with covering up the CIA ’s role in the U.S. national - security regime - change operation that took place in Dallas in November 1963 , which succeeded in ousting from power a president who was , in the eyes of the U.S. national - security establishment , engaged in actions The CIA , Terrorism , an ... Jacob Hornberger Check Amazon for Pricing ",1
"that constituted a grave threat to “ national security , ” i.e. , befriending the Russians ( i.e. , the Soviets ) and Cubans and entering into peaceful coexistence with the communist world ",1
"In other words , unlike Lee Harvey Oswald , who had absolutely no motive to kill President Kennedy , the national security establishment did have motive , a powerful motive , the same motive that motivated the CIA and Pentagon to target other political leaders for regime change or assassination around that time , such as Mohamad Mossadegh , Jacobo Arbenz , Patrice Lumumba ( who Kennedy admired ) , Fidel Castro , and Salvador Allende ",1
"For a more detailed analysis of motive , read FFF ’s ebook JFK ’s War with the National Security Establishment : Why Kennedy Was Assassinated by Douglas Horne , who served on the staff of the Assassination Records Review Board in the 1990s ",1
"Immediately upon the arrest of Lee Harvey Oswald , the official account was that this was just a lone nut , former U.S. Marine communist who decided , for no apparent reason , to assassinate Kennedy ",1
"One big problem is the official story , however , requires a suspension of logic and common sense ",1
"For anyone who has a mindset of conformity and deference to authority , that story makes sense because nothing is questioned or challenged ",0
"For anyone who has a critical , analytical , independent mindset , the official story is filled with holes ",1
"For example , how many communist Marines have you ever heard of ? ",0
"Why would a genuine communist join the Marines in the first place , especially since the Marines had just recently killed millions of North Korean communists ? ",0
"Why would a genuine communist join the Marines knowing that he could be called upon at any moment to go to Korea , Laos , Vietnam , Europe , or elsewhere to kill fellow communists ? ",0

And what better person to frame than a communist or an intelligence agent who the public would believe was a communist ? ,0
"Part of the scheme , obviously , would be to establish Oswald ’s communist bona fides ",0
"That ’s why he was sent to New Orleans , where , contradictorily , he would work for a right - wing business owner , work with a right - wing former FBI agent , and conduct a public protest in favor of Fidel Castro and Cuba ",0
"It was also why he was sent to Mexico City , where he would be ordered to visit the Cuban and Soviet Embassies , no doubt being told that he was being prepared for an important mission , maybe to enter Cuba to assassinate Castro ",1
But no government operation ever goes perfectly ,1
Things obviously went dreadfully wrong with the Mexico City operation because the investigation into it after the assassination was quickly shut down ,1

You guessed it ! ,0

"The letter is not from the dubia cardinals , or from the more than 800,000 signers of the 2015 Filial Appeal , or from the signatories of the Filial Correction , but from a group of Islamic converts to Catholicism , who want Francis to answer a simple question : why did they literally risk their lives to become Catholic if Islam is “ a good religion in itself ” as the pope “ seems to teach ” ? ",0
"It ’s a question he refuses to answer , despite endless platitudes of how important it is to be close to the marginalized and to accompany those on the peripheries of the Church ",0
"The signers , however , are not dissuaded in their pursuit of a paternal answer : ",0
"You do not like to beat around the bush , and neither do we , so allow us to say frankly that we do not understand your teaching about Islam , as we read in paragraphs 252 and 253 of Evangelii Gaudium , because it does not account for the fact that Islam came AFTER Christ , and so is , and can only be , an Antichrist ( see 1 Jn 2.22 ) , and one of the most dangerous because it presents itself as the fulfillment of Revelation ( of which Jesus would have been only a prophet ) ",1

"As a proper Antichrist , Islam exists only as an enemy of all : “ Between us and you there is enmity and hatred forever , until you believe in Allah alone ! ” ( Qur’an 60.4 ) For the Qur’an , Christians “ are only impurity ” ( Quran 9.28 ) , ” “ the worst of Creation ” ( Qur’an 98.6 ) , all condemned to Hell ( Qur’an 4.48 ) , so Allah must exterminate them ( Quran 9.30 ) ",1

Evidence shows Pope Francis is a ‘ principal in a cover - up’ of clergy sex - abuse in Chile : Expert ,1
NewsCatholic Church ,0
"WASHINGTON , D.C. , February 12 , 2018 ( LifeSiteNews ) – Those familiar with Jorge Bergoglio in Argentina before he became Pope Francis say it is a “ classic ” move of his to provide “ mercy ” to clergy who are sexual predators while asking everybody else to simply “ move on , ” said attorney and child advocate Elizabeth Yore on an EWTN show last week ",1
“ I think this is a misplaced mercy ,0
"It is mercy for the predator priests , ” she told EWTN ’s Raymond Arroyo on the February 8 episode of World Over ",1
"“ There are many people who know the Pope from Argentina who have said this is classic Bergoglio to provide mercy to the predators and ask everybody else to move on , ” she added ",1
( See original The World Over program segment on this issue that begins at 47 seconds into the video below ) ,0
"Yore , who has handled child abuse investigations and clergy abuse investigations throughout her legal career , was commenting on the latest sexual abuse case to touch the Francis papacy , in this case where the Pope appointed a bishop with a history of complicity in child sex abuse ",0
The Pope ’s claim that he had never received any victim testimony regarding the complicity of Chilean Bishop Juan Barros in child sex abuse has proven to be false ,0
"“ The Barros case is putting the Pope , for the first time , in the middle as a principal in a cover - up , ” Yore said during the interview ",1
"Yore said that not only is it now known that the Pope received a letter from one of the victims , but it is also now known that he was “ told from the moment he appointed Bishop Barros in 2015 that this was a bad decision ",0
” ,0
“ The Chilean Archbishop conference told him to revoke this appointment ,0
"He received petitions and letters and calls , yet , ignored them all , ” she said ",0
"As details continue to surface , the pontiff ’s professed empathy for abuse victims has come into question as well ",0
Yore called the child sex abuse case involving infamous Chilean priest abuser Father Fernando Karadima and Bishop Juan Barros “ a scandal of epic proportions ,1
” ,1
"The scandal signals that the Church under Francis is slipping backwards in its handling of abuse , said Yore ",0
Yore called the example Pope Francis set in the way he handled the abuse information “ extremely dangerous ,0
” ,0
"“ But it is extremely dangerous as the head of the Catholic Church — you know , the last appeal — that this is the kind of behavior that is going to be mimicked around the world by bishops , [ who will say ] ‘ Well if the Pope is not going to intervene and impose zero tolerance , why should I?’ ” ",1
Reports say Pope Francis personally received the eight - page letter from the Chilean victim graphically detailing the alleged abuses by Karadima and linking Barros as having witnessed and covered up the abuse ,0
The alleged abuse took place decades prior to Francis ’s 2015 appointment of Barros to the Diocese of Osorno in southern Chile ,0
"Pope Francis received the victim ’s letter in 2015 , its author and a member of Francis ’s sex abuse commission have said , contradicting the Pope ’s recent insistence that no victims had come forward in the matter and no evidence had been produced ",0
"Francis encountered protests in Chile over his defense of Barros during his visit there last month , calling the accusations against the priest “ calumny ",1
” ,0
"While Francis later apologized , he persisted in defending Barros , denying that he had received any testimony himself and restating that such unproven accusations are “ slander ",1
” ,0
The Pope later said he would send Malta Archbishop Charles Scicluna – the former top Vatican abuse investigator - to Chile to investigate the matter ,0
Expectations were high in 2014 when the Pope created the abuse commission ,0
"And while he has continually condemned clergy sex abuse throughout his pontificate , some have argued his actions in some serious cases do n’t match his tough stances on abuse ",0
"Four members of the commission had met with Cardinal O’Malley in 2015 , conveying their objections to Francis ’s 2015 appointment of Barros as bishop of Osorno ",0
"It was at the meeting with O’Malley that the abuse commission representatives reportedly gave the letter to the cardinal to deliver to Francis , and O’Malley later confirmed to a commission member that he had in fact personally delivered the letter to the Pope ",0
"Yore explained that the Pope has been told from the moment he appointed Barros in 2015 that it was a bad decision , between the Chilean bishops’ conference , petitions , letters and calls , that were all ignored ",0
"Further , a Chilean judicial inquiry found all the victims who testified — including the letter ’s author Juan Carlos — to be credible , and that there was a major cover - up of the abuse by Father Karadima ",0
"Arroyo spoke with Cruz as well , who said he was “ incredibly frustrated ” when Barros was going to be appointed ",1
"He ’d testified about three bishops who had witnessed abuse , he said , but Barros had special significance for him because Barros’ part went beyond witnessing the abuse , to violating his seal of Confession with Karadima and psychological abuse through intimidation ",1
Cruz recounted how he and other victims had been dismissed or slandered by local Church hierarchy for numerous attempts to be heard ,0
"And he spoke about holding out hope that there would be a different response from the Pope , discussing specifics of getting the letter to the Francis via Cardinal O’Malley ",0
"Cruz told Arroyo he was really hurt and felt betrayed by the Pope ’s comments that the accusations were slander , and there were no witnesses or evidence ",0
"“ To hear him talk about us that way , ” Cruz said , “ calling us slanderers , it was terrible because it set the clock back for so many victims ",0
” ,0
"Scicluna will be meeting with Cruz , who said he hopes other abuse survivors will be heard as a result of his case coming more to the forefront ",0
"“ This leaves us with very strong evidence that the Pope was , in fact , aware of what has happened , ” Yore said ",0
"“ Here we have victims 10 , 15 years after their abuse , begging the Pope , having to take pictures of a letter that ’s handed to a cardinal to ensure that there is evidence that the Pope is receiving this information ",1
” ,0
"The whole of Latin America , including Argentina , was well aware of what was happening when this case broke in Chile in 2010 , Yore noted , and yet the Pope continues to shrug his shoulders and say he has no information ",1
"This was precisely what he ’d been saying when he was cardinal and archbishop in Buenos Aires , she said , that no one ever came forward with information , and there were never any cases of clerical abuse in the entirety of the two - million - plus member Archdiocese of Buenos Aires ",1
"“ This is n’t just simply a cover - up of a predator priest , ” Yore stated ",1
"“ This is Barros present , in the room when the abuse is ongoing with these young minor boys ",0
” ,0
She said she would argue as a child advocate that Barros was involved in sexual exploitation of children ,0
"“ So I do n’t think this is simply just a case , as bad as it is , of a cover - up of an abuser , ” she said ",0
"“ This is also sexual exploitation of children in a grooming gang , a predator priest ",1
This is why it is so heinous ,1
” ,0
"Yore said that given the Church ’s sex abuse crisis , one would have thought going into the 2013 conclave ( which elected Francis ) that an obvious priority in vetting candidates for the papacy would have meant a serious look at their history of handling abuse allegations in their previous sees ",0
"There are more cases out there just like Barros that have been covered up , Yore told Arroyo , maybe even some even worse than the Barros case ",0
"“ Those cases are going to be haunting this papacy and really causing a rift in the major protection of children that Pope Benedict had worked very hard to really build up , ” she said ",1

Can the Church Defend Herself Against Bergoglio ? ,0
"Fisher is rightly incensed by Bergoglio ’s cunning response , “ I will not say a single word on this , ” concerning Archbishop Viganò ’s damning indictment of Bergoglio ’s rehabilitation of the monster once known as Cardinal McCarrick for some five years before adverse worldwide press coverage forced to him to punish that serial homosexual rapist of whose crimes Viganò had personally informed him back in 2013—information of which Bergoglio was clearly already aware at that time , as Viganò testifies ",1
"I never thought I ’d see the day when a preening , Internet - created neo - Catholic doyenne such as Simcha Fisher , as notorious as Mark Shea for her crude and often unprintable invective against traditionalists , would unload on Pope Bergoglio with the following headline : “ Does Francis know he sounds like an abuser ? ” ",1
"The scales have fallen from Fisher ’s eyes and now , at last , she sees Bergoglio , however grudgingly , for what he is : a power - mad ecclesiastical tyrant ",1
"( A tyrant , moreover , who has ascended to the papacy in a manner reminiscent of the ascension of the corrupt Benedict IX , another “ disgrace to the Chair of Peter , ” following the machinations of a Roman cabal , as I discuss below ",1
) ,0
Quoth Fisher : ,0
I have a number of friends who have escaped abusive marriages ,0
They tell me that Pope Francis is sounding more and more like the men who abused them ,1
"He ’s sounding like the men who hid that abuse from the world , who taught their victims to blame themselves , who used spiritual pressure to persuade them and their families that it would actually be wrong , sinful , to defend themselves ",1
Just listen to him ,0
"After responding to a question about Vigano ’s very serious accusations , he said point blank , “ I will not say a single word on this ",0
"” … [ F]or the rest of the week and more , he kept up an unmistakable theme of calling for silence , equating silence with holiness , and painting himself as a Christlike victim in his silence ",1
Then he says it ’s “ ugly ” to accuse others of sinning ,0
Then he suggests that healing and reconciliation will only come if we take a hard look at our own flaws … ,1
"To the victims of the Church , and to those who love them , it sounds like he is saying , “ Who do you think you are ? ",1
I do n’t have to explain myself to you ,1
You ’re the guilty one ,1
You brought this on yourself ,1
"If you want to be loved , then know your place ",1
"I ’m the victim , here , not you ",1
"If you know what ’s good for you , keep your mouth shut ",1
” This is how abusers talk ,1
"They ’re not content with power ; they have to keep their victims doubting and blaming themselves constantly , so they do n’t become a threat ",1
"Whether Francis knows it or not , this is how he sounds ",1
We can overlook the fig leaf “ whether Francis knows it or not … ” ,0
"Fisher knows that Francis knows it , even if she still can not bring herself to say explicitly what should now be apparent to the entire body of the faithful : that Bergoglio ’s very presence on the Chair of Peter is a grave threat to the common good of the Church and the integrity of the Faith ",1

Yet Fisher maintains a sliver of space for deniability in order to maintain that indispensable distinction between her and those loathsome traditionalists : “ I do n’t have any ideological reason to want to bring him down ,1
"I have defended him as long as I could , up until the Chile debacle ",0
"And so I am working as hard as I can not to assume the worst , not to believe that this man who promised so much fresh air is really so intent on slamming doors shut before we find out even worse things hidden inside ",1
But he is not making it easy ,1
I am not saying he is an abuser ,1
But he sounds like one ,1
” ,0
"That is , Fisher was not concerned about Bergoglio ’s relentless assault on traditional Catholic teaching and practice — to her , opposition to Francis on that account is just “ ideology”—but only his role in covering up sexual abuse by bishops and priests ",1
But why is Fisher still “ working hard not to assume the worst ” when there is no longer anything to assume as the ever - mounting evidence of malintent has been in plain view for years ? ,0
"Indeed , why else did Archbishop Viganò risk everything in order to expose this Pope , even to the extent of revealing matters supposedly within the scope of “ the Pontifical secret ” ? ",1
"On orders of the Vatican Secretary of State , the Vatican secret police are reportedly scouring the globe in search of Viganò , who has gone into hiding , “ in order to prevent more unpredictable damage to the image of Pope Francis and the Holy See on the world stage , but also to ‘ prepare the terrain’ for the former apostolic nuncio - turned - whistleblower to be prosecuted ” under canon law ",1
The Dictator Pope must destroy his most potent critic thus far ,1
Everything depends on it ! ,1
But it may already be too late to save a regime whose only defense is not truth but raw power ,0
"At last count , some 29 bishops have publicly declared Viganò ’s allegations against Bergoglio credible and worthy of investigation ",0
"Now even the distinguished canonist Edward Peters , who is no less than a Referendary of the Apostolic Signatura appointed by Pope Benedict XVI , declares that if Viganò ’s allegations are true then Bergoglio must go : ",0
"Of what was said above concerning resignation from Church office in general , what would not apply to a pope , of all office holders , if he , as alleged by Viganò , from the first months of his papacy knowingly protected and favored a cardinal who was [ pick a disgusting verb]-ing seminarians ? ",0
By what possible stretch of the imagination would such an occupant be suited for the Chair of Peter ? ,1
Does the historical fact that some pretty bad popes held on to office despite committing various offenses justify other popes acting badly in shirking even the minimal gesture of resigning ? ,0
"Viganò is unquestionably in a position to know , and claims to know , whether his central allegation that Francis’ was covering for McCarrick , big time , for years , is correct ",1
"Believing , as he does , that his claims are correct , Viganò , in calling for Francis’ resignation , has done nothing more or less than exercise his right under canon law “ to manifest to the sacred pastors [ his ] opinion on matters which pertain to the good of the Church and to make [ his ] opinion known to the rest of the Christian faithful … ” 1983 CIC 212 § 3 ",0
"I have not called for Francis’ resignation because I do not know ( with the degree of certitude that a lawyer seeks ) whether Viganò ’s key allegations against Francis are substantially true ; most assuredly , however , if I reach the conclusion that they are true , I would say , without hesitation , that Francis should resign ",0
"Bergoglio will not , of course , resign ",1
He will cling to power with his last breath in order to carry out the many other acts of ecclesial subversion he clearly has in mind ,1
The only remedies for the plague of Bergoglio are his natural death or deposition ,1
"Yes , deposition ",0
"Canon212 has linked to an interesting and timely piece on the role of the Synod of Sutri , near Rome , in 1046 , which dealt with the problem of three rival claimants to the papacy , each installed by a Roman faction : First , the execrable Benedict IX , mentioned above ",1
"Second , the interloper Sylvester III , installed in the Chair of Peter after Benedict had been driven from Rome ",1
"Third , the well - intentioned but dimwitted Gregory VI , whose election was tainted by a seemingly simoniacal negotiation with Benedict , who had returned to Rome in 1045 and ousted Sylvester , according to which Benedict would receive a generous pension if he resigned the papacy , which Benedict did only to rescind his resignation ",1
"The Synod was convoked by Henry III , the German king and soon - to - be - crowned Holy Roman Emperor , a pious and austere Christian and an exponent of the Cluniac spirit of reform ",1
The Synod declared that Benedict IX ( who had refused to appear ) was deposed notwithstanding his attempt to undo his resignation ,0
"As for Sylvester , the Synod declared that he be “ stripped of his sacerdotal rank and shut up in a monastery ",1
"” Gregory was also declared deposed , either by the act of the Synod itself or by Gregory ’s own voluntary resignation in view of the Synod ",0
"At Henry III ’s designation , the German Bishop of Bamberg became Clement II , but he died after only a year , whereupon Benedict reasserted his claim to the papacy for the third time in 1047 , only to be driven from Rome again by Imperial troops in 1048 ",0
"Damasus II , another German bishop designated by Henry , reigned for a mere three weeks before dying , whereupon Pope St. Leo IX succeeded to the papacy , reigning until 1054 ",0
"Leo , as John Rao observes , was the first in a line of Popes who “ took charge of the movement of innovative Christian restoration ” which included a breaking of the dominance of Roman nobility over papal elections ",0
"( Rao , Black Legends , 147 - 148 ) ",0
"As the cited article on the Synod of Sutri notes , although the scurrilous Benedict IX objected to his deposition by the Synod , “ the Church has always accepted his deposition as valid ",1
"The King of Germany then appointed Clement II as Pope , who promptly crowned the King , Holy Roman Emperor ",0
"Benedict IX , after the death of Clement , claimed the papacy again ! ",0
The Church to this day recognizes Clement II as a true Pope ,0
” ,0
"Moreover , Benedict IX himself is recognized as a true Pope — a valid but deposed Pope — during three separate periods listed as three distinct pontificates in the canon of Popes ",0
This was possible owing to the lack of any set canonical form for papal elections ; a Pope could gain or regain the office by various machinations ,0
"Indeed , even the Vatican ’s own website states that Benedict was Pope from 1047 - 1048 , the very year of his third ascension to the office from which he was finally driven by force ",0
"Only with the ascension of Pope Nicholas II in 1059 was it established that henceforth the cardinal - bishops would elect the Pope , with the other cardinals having the right to confirm or veto the nominee ",0
"By 1100 what we now know as the College of Cardinals , embracing all the cardinals of different titles , had the exclusive right to elect a Pope , and the members of the College “ have held it ever since ",0
"” ( Eric John , The Popes , 181 ) ",0
"These lessons of history should suffice to dispel the pious fable , never a teaching of the Magisterium , that every Pope is chosen by the Holy Ghost to lead the Church ",1
"This theological error , which Bergoglio has exploited to the hilt , is a key element in the related error of papalotry , which elevates the person of the Pope above the office he occupies and makes of him the leader of a personality cult everyone is commanded to “ love ” ( in the superficially emotional sense ) and obey no matter what he says or does , rather than a custodian and defender of the Deposit of Faith whose lovability , personality and opinions are utterly irrelevant to the exercise and scope of his office ",1
"As Pope Benedict has observed , when it comes to the election of a Pope “ the Spirit ’s role should be understood in a much more elastic sense , not that he [ sic ] dictates the candidate for whom one must vote … ",0
There are too many contrary instances of popes the Holy Spirit obviously would not have picked ! ” Bergoglio is undeniably one of them ,1
So what can be done to defend the Church against Bergoglio ? ,0
"That the mode of papal election by cardinals has persisted for nearly a thousand years has led to the general impression that it pertains to the irreformable divine constitution of the Church , but it certainly does not ",0
As to matters of purely ecclesiastical law such as this one the Church has always allowed for departures from traditional practice in cases of emergency or grave necessity ,0
"And just as a synod was employed to address three rival claimants to the papal throne in 1046 , declaring at least two of them deposed , so today might it be possible for reform - minded cardinals and bishops , comprising an imperfect council , to undo the incalculable damage caused by the cabal that lobbied for Bergoglio ’s election before the last conclave — a cabal that included none other than McCarrick , whom Bergoglio rewarded by rehabilitating that monster despite the massive evidence of his unspeakable crimes ",1
What would be the grounds for a declaration of deposition at such a gathering of prelates ? ,0
"One could readily point to the evidence that a faction that included Bergoglio himself had agreed upon his election before the conclave , and that all those involved , including Bergoglio , were thereby excommunicated latae sententiae in accordance with Article 81 of John Paul II ’s Universi Dominici Gregis , which provides : ",1
"The Cardinal electors shall further abstain from any form of pact , agreement , promise or other commitment of any kind which could oblige them to give or deny their vote to a person or persons ",1
"If this were in fact done , even under oath , I decree that such a commitment shall be null and void and that no one shall be bound to observe it ; and I hereby impose the penalty of excommunication latae sententiae upon those who violate this prohibition ",1
"To quote Cajetan on this point ( citations taken from the linked article by Robert Siscoe ) , deposition by an imperfect council is appropriate “ when one or more Popes suffer uncertainty with regard to their election , as seems to have arisen in the schism of Urban VI and others ",1
"Then , lest the Church be perplexed , those members of the Church who are available have the power to judge which is the true pope , if it can be known , and if it can not be known , [ it has ] the power to provide that the electors agree on one or another of them ",1
” ,0
I am not saying that such a case has been proven ,0
"Rather , what I am saying is that this hypothetical imperfect council could determine that it has been proven and act accordingly , and that the Church would judge any resulting deposition of Bergoglio in the same manner it judges the deposition of Benedict IX ",0
"Another ground for deposition — as determined by the imperfect council , not any of us — would be that Bergoglio has deposed himself by promulgating heresy , fracturing the Church ’s universal discipline respecting marriage and the Eucharist , and undermining the teaching of even his own immediate predecessors on matters of fundamental morality upheld by the Magisterium for two millennia ",1
Surely the Church can not be without any remedy for a Pope who relentlessly attacks her very foundations ! ,1
To quote Cajetan again : “ Indeed the Church has the right to separate herself from an heretical pope according to divine law ,1
"Consequently , it has the right , by the same divine law , to use all means of themselves necessary for such separation ; and those that juridically correspond to the crime , are of themselves necessary”—meaning the resort to an imperfect council ",1
"If a synod was able to declare the deposition of a pope in 1046 , why not an imperfect council today — or , for that matter , another synod ? ",0
It will be argued that such a deposition would provoke massive schisms in the Church ,0
"But that would not be the first time that defense of the Church ’s common good has done so , as the Great Western Schism demonstrates ",0
"And are we not in the midst of schisms already , provoked by none other than Bergoglio himself , whose insane drive to shatter the Church ’s bimillennial discipline has produced the totally unprecedented situation in which what is still considered mortally sinful in one diocese is an imperative of “ mercy ” in another ? ",1
"In any case , this much is certain : barring Bergoglio ’s conversion and reversal of course , the Church can not abide this pontificate any longer ",0
"One way or another , the Church will have to repel an attacker at her very summit ",0
"Either the human element of the Church will act according to the means which seem possible , however extraordinary , or Heaven itself will intervene in a manner that might well involve a divine chastisement due to the negligence of time - serving pastors who left their sheep completely undefended against the wolves who preyed upon them , including the wolf the cardinals improvidently elected Pope ",1
"Some four months before Archbishop Viganò ’s testimony Cardinal Willem Jacobus Eijk , the Archbishop of Utrecht , Netherlands , perhaps the most liberal territory in the entire Church , protested that Bergoglio ’s blatant nod to intercommunion with Protestants in Germany means that “ the bishops and , above all , the Successor of Peter fail to maintain and transmit faithfully and in unity the deposit of faith contained in Sacred Tradition and Sacred Scripture ” and that the situation reminds him of Article 675 of the Catechism of the Catholic Church , which refers to the Church ’s “ final trial ” before the Second Coming , “ that will shake the faith of many believers … [ a ] ‘ mystery of iniquity’ in the form of a religious deception offering men an apparent solution to their problems at the price of apostasy from the truth ",1
"What can the Church do when confronted by a Pope who , as a prominent cardinal declares to the whole world , “ fail[s ] to maintain and transmit faithfully … the deposit of faith contained in Sacred Tradition and Sacred Scripture ” and is leading “ an apostasy from the truth ” ? ",1
"It seems absurd to argue that she can do nothing but exhort the faithful to pray and do penance while a papal malefactor , treated as if were an absolute dictator , is allowed to continue wreaking havoc upon faith and morals to the detriment of countless souls , without the least impediment , for so long as he shall live ",1
"No , Bergoglio must go ",0
"The successors of the Apostles , the only ones in a position to end his rampage , must demand his resignation and , should he refuse as expected , act in this unprecedented emergency to declare his removal from the office he has criminally abused and whose very credibility he threatens to destroy ",1
May God give them the grace to do what must be done and what history will vindicate as a rescue of the Church during the height of the worst crisis in her history ,1
Iran Admits To Aiding Al - Qaeda and Facilitating 9/11 Jihad Terror Attacks ,0
"This has long been known , although the mainstream media dismissed it as a conspiracy theory ",0
But now we have definitive confirmation ,0
"It was Iran Bush should have invaded after 9/11 , not Iraq ",0
"Now consider this : even though , as President of the United States , Barack Obama had access to information that the general public does not have , and certainly knew of Iran ’s involvement in the 9/11 attacks , Obama still pursued the Iran nuclear deal and gave billions to the Islamic Republic ",0
"The Iran nuclear deal should never have proceeded — President Obama , the worst president in American history ",1
"“ Iran Admits To Facilitating 9/11 Terror Attacks , ” by Adam Kredo , Washington Free Beacon , June 8 , 2018 : ",0
"Iranian officials , in a first , have admitted to facilitating the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the U.S. by secretly aiding the free travel of al Qaeda operatives who eventually went on to fly commercial airliners into the Twin Towers in New York City , according to new remarks from a senior Iranian official ",0
"Mohammad - Javad Larijani , an international affairs assistant in the Iran ’s judiciary , disclosed in Farsi - language remarks broadcast on Iran ’s state - controlled television that Iranian intelligence officials secretly helped provide the al Qaeda attackers with passage and gave them refuge in the Islamic Republic , according to an English translation published by Al Arabiya ",0
"“ Our government agreed not to stamp the passports of some of them because they were on transit flights for two hours , and they were resuming their flights without having their passports stamped ",0
"However their movements were under the complete supervision of the Iranian intelligence , ” Larijani was quoted as saying ",0
The remarks represent the first time senior Iranian officials have publicly admitted to aiding al Qaeda and playing a direct role in facilitating the 9/11 attacks ,0
The U.S. government has long accused Iran of playing a role in the attacks and even fined the Islamic Republic billions as a result ,0
The U.S. 9/11 Commission assembled to investigate the attacks concluded that Iran played a role in facilitating the al Qaeda terrorists ,0
Larijani admitted that Iranian officials did not stamp the passports of the al Qaeda militants in order to obfuscate their movements and prevent detection by foreign governments ,0

Puerto Rico ’s Power Grid Failure Is Causing A Public Health Crisis Of Epic Proportions ,1
"One month after the devastating Hurricane Maria wreaked havoc on the island of Puerto Rico , the territory is still facing a public health crisis ",1
And it ’s a crisis of epic proportions ,1
"On Friday , former Puerto Rican Governor Alejandro García Padilla tweeted a photo from inside a hospital , in which scrubbed - up doctors leaned over an operating table performing surgery lit only by a flashlight ",0
"According to Slate , the image quickly made the rounds on the internet ; it currently has almost 9,000 retweets and many speculate that that ’s probably because the blurry picture feels like it ’s worth a good deal more than 1,000 words ",1
It illuminates just a small sliver of the public health crisis Puerto Rico is currently facing ,1

"Millions of residents still do n’t have access to electricity or proper health care , and bacteria in the water have exposed many people to disease ",0
And calls for help have gone unanswered besides the few willing to travel to the devastated island privately ,1
Senator Martin Heinrich ( D - NM ) along with a handful of other lawmakers are calling on the federal government to continue to provide aid to the post - apocalyptic ravaged territory ,1
"“ Even before Hurricanes Irma and Maria hit the U.S. territories , the islands’ health care system was suffering from the ongoing economic crisis ",0
"The islands are grappling with physician shortages , Medicaid programs facing an impending funding cliff , and widespread disparities in Federal health programs — and that was before hurricane season , ” the lawmakers stated in a letter ",1
"“ We are grateful for the public health emergency declaration in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands , but more can and should be done to help Americans impacted by these disasters ",1
” ,0
"The senators stressed that much of the islands’ power and communication networks are out and , according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) , it will take months before power is fully restored ",0
"Hospitals have been forced to prioritize patients , ration services , and forgo elective surgeries ",0
"The power grid ’s failure has caused more problems than many anticipated , like the stall of relief efforts ",0
"Without electricity , communications are non - existent too ",0
"Some 33 days after Hurricane Maria made landfall on Puerto Rico , only 23 percent of residents have electricity , according to Status.pr , which provides daily updates on basic services on the island ",0
"While there are still other problems as well , such as gas stations being slow to reopen , and roads getting badly damaged , the power grid ’s utter annihilation in the category 4 winds is not just a temporary inconvenience ",1
The different ways that the lack of electricity can set off a cascade of other crises is becoming increasingly clear ,0
"A giant government - owned hospital ship , the USNS Comfort , arrived in Puerto Rico weeks ago to help out , but many people do n’t know about the ship ",0
"Without electricity , most cell phone towers are down ",0
"But even if communications were working , residents ca n’t get to the port , as many of the island ’s roads are impassable and most are without gasoline to power a car ",0
"The ship has extensive space and equipment for trauma care and a large staff , but CNN reported that as of last Tuesday , only 33 of 250 beds were full ",0
"The looming crisis seems to be getting worse , not better , and Puerto Rico is experiencing a medical crisis of epic proportions ",1

"The word khalifa means “ successor ” ; the caliph in Sunni Islamic theology is the successor of Muhammad as the military , political , and spiritual leader of the Muslims ",0
"As I show in my book The History of Jihad From Muhammad to ISIS , the great caliphates of history , from the immediate post - Muhammad period of the “ Rightly Guided Caliphs ” to the Umayyads , Abbasids , and Ottomans , as well as other Islamic states , all waged relentless jihad warfare against non - Muslims , subjugating them under the rule of Islamic law and denying them basic rights ",0
"These were n’t the actions of a “ tiny minority of extremists , ” abhorred by the vast majority of peaceful Muslims for “ hijacking ” their religion ",1

"And so it is today : Said Khecharem has enunciated that responsibility more clearly and directly than most Muslim spokesmen do these days , but he is by no means the only one who believes that it exists ",0
What is noteworthy also about The History of Jihad is something that it does not contain ,0
"As the jihadis move against non - Muslim states without any letup , pause , period of coexistence , period of tolerance , reformation , or reconsideration , there never appears any force of Muslims to oppose them ",0

"There is still no mosque or Islamic school in the United States that teaches young Muslims why they should reject the understanding of Islam taught by al - Qaeda , ISIS , and other jihad terror groups ",1

"During an appearance with Tucker Carlson on Fox , Rep. Scott Perry ( R - Pa ",0

"ISIS terrorists , he said , infiltrated the U.S. via the southern border prior to the attack blamed on alleged lone gunman Stephen Paddock ",0
"“ Recently I have been made aware of what I believe to be credible evidence , credible information regarding potential terrorist infiltration through the southern border regarding this incident , ” Perry said ",0
Perry added that ISIS warnings of a forthcoming attack on Las Vegas prior to the shooting make a terror link even more likely ,0
"“ Well , they could be – lets face it , ISIS twice before the attack , ISIS warned the United States that they would attack Las Vegas in June and August after the attack claimed responsibility four times ",0

Where did it originate from ? ,0
Ebola virus disease ( EVD ) was first discovered in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks ,0
One in what is now Nzara in South Sudan ,0
The other outbreak in Yambuku in Zaire in what is now DR Congo ,0
"The latter occurred in a village near the Ebola River , from which the disease takes its name ",0
Why is it so dangerous ? ,0
The average Ebola fatality rate is about 50 percent ,0
But the rates have varied from 25 percent to 90 percent in recent outbreaks ,0
"There is as of yet no proven cure available for Ebola , though some vaccines are being tested ",0
"Some people who have recovered from Ebola have developed long - term complications , such as joint and vision problems ",0
It is not known why some people recover from Ebola while most succumb to the disease ,0
Why does it keep coming back ? ,0
"The disease infects humans through close contact with infected animals , including chimpanzees , fruit bats and forest antelope ",0
"In Africa where most outbreaks happen , particular species of fruit bats are considered natural hosts for the Ebola virus ",0
"Infected bats are believed to transmit the disease to humans , or indirectly through other animals that are hunted for their meat ",0
"The family of the first victim of the 2014 outbreak , a two - year - old child , hunted bats and it is believed bushmeat was the origin of the outbreak ",0
"An estimated five million tonnes of bushmeat is consumed on the continent every year , according to the Centre for International Forestry Research ",0
"The virus then spreads between humans by direct contact with infected blood , bodily fluids or organs , or indirectly through contact with contaminated environments ",0
"Even funerals of Ebola victims can be a risk , if mourners have direct contact with the body of the deceased ",1
Cardinal Müller : Blessing homosexual couples would be an ‘ atrocity’ ,1
NewsCatholic Church ,0
"BRATISLAVA , Slovakia , February 13 , 2018 ( LifeSiteNews ) – Former Vatican doctrine chief Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller has decried the Church 's current adaptation to the modern world and rejected the idea of blessing homosexual couples ",0
"The remarks , made in a February 6 talk in Slovakia , indirectly respond to new initiatives coming from Germany , especially from Cardinal Reinhard Marx and Bishop Franz - Josef Bode ",0
"Cardinal Müller , former Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , spoke at a conference on John Paul II 's encyclical Veritatis Splendor at the Comenius University in Bratislava , organized by the Slovakian Bishops ' Conference ",0
"In remarks after his address , reported by the German Catholic newspaper Die Tagespost , the cardinal made it clear what he thinks about the recently presented German idea of blessing homosexual unions , even if only in individual cases : “ If a priest blesses a homosexual couple , then this is an atrocity at a holy site , namely , to approve of something that God does not approve of ",1
” ,1
"According to the Tagespost report , Cardinal Müller said in his address that he regrets the separation of the Church 's doctrinal and moral teaching and called Christianity a “ theocentric humanism ",1
” He said the “ submissive change of the Church into a NGO for the embetterment of the this - worldly life conditions ” is a “ suicidal modernization ” that denies mankind the Truth of God ,1
"In this context , the German cardinal also criticized Martin Luther 's own denial of man 's free will and his teaching about the total depravity of man that separates morality from the relationship with God ",0
"Morality , Müller explained , is rooted in Grace ; that is why any teaching about “ rules and exceptions ” ignores the character of the ethics of the Covenant and of Grace ",0
"In the discussion following his talk , Cardinal Müller also responded to questions concerning Pope Francis ' post - synodal exhortation , Amoris Laetitia ",0
The cardinal said that he is “ not happy ” about the fact that there are different interpretations of this papal text by some bishops ' conferences ,0
"“ In dogmatic questions , there can not be a plurality , ” he added ",1
"There is only one Magisterium , he said , and bishops ' conferences can only decide about pastoral questions ",1
"Contradictory conceptions concerning the Sacraments , said the cardinal , lead into chaotic conditions ",0
"Thus , explained the cardinal , the Sacraments have to be celebrated the way Christ Himself willed it when he instituted them ",1
"The controversial eighth chapter of Amoris Laetitia has to be understood “ in an orthodox way , ” namely that “ he who lives in the state of mortal sin can not receive Holy Communion ",1
"” It is , in Müller 's eyes , the pope 's duty “ to unite the Church , that is what the pope is there for ",1
"” This is what he , Müller , himself told the pope : when the bishops ' conferences present different interpretations of Amoris Laetitia , the Church enters “ into a situation like the one before the Reformation ",0
” ,0
"Archbishop Stanislav Zvolensy , President of the Slovakian Bishops ' Conference and archbishop of Bratislava , told Die Tagespost that Veritatis Splendor is not only still valid , but shows timeless truths ",0
"Promulgated 25 years ago , the encyclical rejects authoritatively the theory of situation ethics , a theory that seems to be getting again much attention in our time , for example by theologians such as Professor Maurizio Chiodi ",0
"Professor Livio Melina , the former President of the Pontifical John Paul II Institute for Studies on Marriage and the Family , was another speaker at the February 6 conference ",0
"He stressed that Amoris Laetitia has to be “ read in the context of the magisterial instructions of the encyclical Veritatis Splendor , which recalls the connection between conscience and truth , as well as the necessity of a well - formed conscience ",0
"” In returning to that encyclical , explained the Italian professor and theologian , Amoris Laetitia could be given a hermeneutic in light of a “ continuity with the Magisterium of the Church ",0
” He also said : “ The Commandments are an expression of the Love of God for us ,1
"If we fulfill them , we are united with God ",1

Gonzalez is contending the jury should have been told that “ momentary ” possession of a gun is not necessarily a crime ,0
"“ If you possess it just to dispose of it or abandon it , it would n’t be a crime , ” Gonzalez told reporters ",0
"The Steinle family and relatives of murder victims have new cause for outrage , but this gambit is consistent with Gonzalez and the San Francisco show - trial in which he co - starred ",1
"Gonzalez hails from McAllen , Texas , and attended Columbia University on a scholarship ",0
"As he explained , “ I think I was a product of affirmative action , ” and ethnic preferences doubtless played a role in admission to Stanford Law School ",0
"In San Francisco , Gonzalez became known as “ The Great Left Hope , ” and a hero to Bay Area radicals ",1
"The La Raza Lawyers Association named Gonzalez Lawyer of the Year , and the Mexican American Political Association , a group with roots in the Communist Party , gave him the Bert Corona award , after one of the CPUSA ’s most high - profile Stalinists ",0
"In 2,000 , after a decade as a public defender , Gonzalez gained election to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors ",0
"In 2003 , as board president , he commissioned a graffiti artist to spray SMASH THE STATE on his office wall , in “ traffic cone orange ",1
"” As Gonzalez explained , “ This is a sentiment I think all of us have had ",0
You have to rally and find ways of opposing what you do n’t like ,0
” ,0
In 2003 Gonzalez ran for mayor of San Francisco but lost to Gavin Newsom ,0
In 2008 Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader tapped Gonzalez for vice president ,0
"“ He has a great , steadfast commitment to justice , ” Nader told reporters ",1
"On that score , the Steinle family and other relatives of murder victims have room for reasonable doubt ",0
"In jury selection , Gonzalez and the prosecutor , assistant district attorney Diana Garcia , included three “ immigrants , ” quite possibly false - documented illegals ",0
"True to form , judge Samuel Feng sealed the identities of the jurors ",0
So observers have grounds to believe that Garcia and Gonzalez both got the jury they wanted ,0
"Garcia told the court Zarate was playing his own “ secret version of Russian roulette , ” and thus parroted the defense ’s contention that the shooting was all a matter of chance ",1
"As it happens , in Russian roulette a shooter loads one bullet into a six - shot revolver , spins the cylinder , then puts the gun to his own head and pulls the trigger ",0
"In a central fact of the case , Zarate did not aim the gun at himself but fired in the direction of Kate Steinle ",0
"In another established fact , the bullet struck her in the lower back and tore through her abdominal aorta ",0
"This happened in broad daylight , but as in In the Heat of the Night , they had the body which was dead ",0
Garcia Zarate confessed to firing the shot and had gunpowder residue on his hands ,0
"After firing , he tossed the gun in the water ",0
"He said he had found the stolen weapon wrapped in a cloth and that it discharged by itself , both utterly unbelievable claims ",0
"Even so , the politically correct jury found the career criminal not guilty of murder and manslaughter ",0
Any observer could be forgiven for believing that prosecution and defense both got the outcome they wanted ,0
"Unlike Stalin ’s trials of the old Bolsheviks , and Fidel Castro’ trial of General Arnaldo Ochoa , this show trial aimed to establish innocence for the guilty , and the dynamics of the left were on full display ",1
Denunciations of “ gun violence ” were nowhere in evidence and expressions of sympathy for the Steinle family proved pathetically weak ,0
"As Arthur Koestler said , on the left the truth is spoken with loathing and falsehood with love ",0
"On the left , as Orwell had it in Animal Farm , rats are comrades , and criminals are victims of capitalist society ",0
"In the view of Gonzalez , society is progressing toward a social justice paradise ruled by a wise elite that knows what ’s best for all ",1
"In this inexorable progress , determined by history , some people are going to have to die ",0
"As Bertolt Brecht told Sidney Hook about Stalin ’s victims , “ the more innocent they are , the more they deserve to be shot ",1
” ,1
"Out for a summer - day walk with her father and a friend , Kate Steinle was a completely innocent victim , gunned down by a career criminal who was not even supposed to be in the country but found special protection in the sanctuary city of San Francisco , part of the sanctuary state of California ",0
"As defense attorney Francisco Ugarte said , the verdict was a “ vindication for the rights of immigrants ",0
” ,0
"Since Donald Trump mentioned the case , former vice - presidential candidate Matt Gonzalez had to establish the complete innocence of the shooter ",0
That explains the effort of “ The Great Left Hope ” to have his client ’s felony gun possession conviction tossed ,1
Any observer of the case could believe it probably will be ,0
"Solar Storm Will Strike Earth Tonight , ‘ Weak Power Grid Fluctuations’ Possible ",0
The NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center forecasts an aurora could light up the sky above areas in the United State including Michigan and Maine ,0
"A solar storm , which occurred Monday , is expected to strike Earth tonight ",0
"On Monday , the sun spit out a slew of charged particles in a moderate solar flare ",0
These particles are now making their way towards Earth ,0
"The planet ’s magnetic field will block most of the particles , but some will make it into Earth ’s atmosphere ",0
The particles collect at the north and south poles and interact with atmospheric gases to create the aurora borealis or the Northern Lights ,0
And some say this show could be quite spectacular ,0
"Solar flares have been known to cause power grid failures , but it looks like we ’ll only get the light show this time ",0
"Although a grid failure is possible , it is unlikely ",0
"According to Seeker , the forecast calls for a high probability of a G-1 or “ minor ” storm , which could strengthen to a G-2 or “ moderate ” storm depending on how the stream of particles hit the Earth ",0
"Geomagnetic storms are ranked on a scale , with G at the bottom , R in the middle , and S as the most severe ",0
Forecasts now say the particles will give our planet a glancing blow ,0
"Although this storm has been categorized as “ G-1 , ” which means it is minor , it could still cause some havoc down on Earth ",0
Solar flares and particle ejections are associated with sunspots — dark areas on the sun ’s surface — that host intense magnetic activity ,0
"As the magnetic fields in a sunspot cross , NASA stated , this can cause a sudden energy explosion , also known as a solar flare ",0
"This sends radiation out into space , and that radiation can be hurled toward the Earth ",0
"G1-level storms , such as Monday ’s , may affect migratory animals , and can cause “ weak power grid fluctuations ",0
” The barrage of particles may even have a minor impact on satellites ,0
"A gird failure would almost immediately fling the United States into a state of panic , and it ’s always good to be prepared just in case ",1
But it does n’t look like there will be any serious damage to the power grid because of this storm as of right now ,0
Hungarian Prime Minister : ‘ Christianity is Europe ’s last hope’ ,1
"NewsFaith , Politics - World ",0
"BUDAPEST , Hungary , February 19 , 2018 ( LifeSiteNews ) – Brushing aside any semblance of political correctness , Hungary ’s Prime Minister said in his state of the nation speech on Sunday that , “ Christianity is Europe 's last hope ",1
” ,1
"Addressing his country and the world , Prime Minister Viktor Orbán warned that European nations which have encouraged migration have , “ opened the way to the decline of Christian culture and the advance of Islam ",1
” ,1
Orbán painted an image of Western Europe being overwhelmed by the accelerating influx Muslim immigrants in recent years ,0
"“ According to estimates , the proportion of immigrants will grow at an accelerated pace in the European countries west of us , ” said Orbán ",0
"“ I wo n't even say anything about France and Holland , but even the born Germans are being forced back from most large German cities as migrants always occupy big cities first ",0
” ,0
"Orbán warned that as Western Europe becomes saturated with Muslim occupants , Islamists would soon seek to stream in to his country from both Western Europe as well as from Islamic nations ",1
"“ This means that the Islamic civilization , which always considers its vocation to convert Europe to what it calls the true faith , in the future will be knocking on the door of Central Europe not only from the south , but from the west , as well , ” he said ",1
Prime Minister Orbán said his government will oppose efforts by the United Nations or the European Union to “ increase migration ” around the world ,0
"In June , LifeSiteNews reported that Orbán had taken a strong stand and not backed down against outside globalist influences seeking to control his nation ’s politics ",0
"Billionaire George Soros , who famously backs many progressive initiatives around the world , locked horns with Orbán over the Central European University ( CEU ) he founded in 1989 , which has been criticized as a funnel for anti - nationalist views ",1
"Orbán and Soros have a history , beginning in partnership and ending in acrimony ",0
Orbán started public life as a crusader against communism and attended Oxford University on a Soros scholarship ,0
"Soros , who expatriated from Hungary , also funded Orbán ’s political organization , the Alliance for Young Democrats ",0
"But Orbán ’s defense of conservative values has led to breaking ties with Soros , whom he now criticizes as a foreigner meddling in his country ’s affairs ",1
"After Prime Minister Orbán delivered his strongly worded state of the nation speech , a UK Daily Mail report said , “ Orbán has conflated the issue of immigration with the image of Soros , 87 , whose name was used in a tough anti - migrant bill sent to Parliament on Wednesday ",1
” ,0
The Daily Mail report continued : ,0
"Soros , for his part , compared Orbán unfavourably to both the Nazis and the Communists , saying his rule evoked dark tones from the 1930 's , when Hungary was allied with Nazi Germany ",1
"But Orbán remains committed to his policy , claiming that Soros and supporters of migration are losing the fight ",0
"He said : “ Soros has antagonised not only us but also England , President Trump and Israel too ",0
Everywhere he wants to get migration accepted ,0
It wo n't work ,0
We are not alone and we will fight together and we will succeed ,0
” ,0
"In addition to inviting Soros’ ire , Orbán came under fire a couple years ago from the U.S. State Department under President Obama as well as the European Parliament for purportedly discriminating against homosexuals because of Hungary ’s insistence on defining marriage between a man and a woman , and that pre - born babies have rights ",0
"Last year , Orbán also criticized liberals and encouraged citizens to give life to more children during the 11th conference of the World Congress of Families ",0
Three thousand “ natural family ” advocates who attended the four - day conference heard Orbán in his opening address lambaste the European Union ( EU ) for its “ relativizing liberal ideology that ’s an insult to families ,0

"President Donald Trump said he ’ll mobilize the U.S. military to close the border with Mexico to stop an “ assault ” on the nation by a caravan of migrants from Central America , according to a report by Bloomberg.com ",1
"Trump , who ran in 2016 promising to tighten U.S. immigration laws and stanch the inflow of undocumented migrants , has called for cutting off foreign aid to Guatemala , Honduras and El Salvador if they do n’t stop the migrants ",0
He claimed Thursday — without providing evidence — that Democrats are backing the human movement to bolster their case for “ open borders and existing weak laws ,0

"“ In addition to stopping all payments to these countries , which seem to have almost no control over their population , I must , in the strongest of terms , ask Mexico to stop this onslaught — and if unable to do so I will call up the U.S. Military and CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER ! ” Trump said on Twitter ",1
"Days ago the president threatened to withhold American aid from Honduras , Guatemala and El Salvador if the flow of immigrants was n’t stopped ",0
"This prompted the Honduran Foreign Ministry to urge its citizens not to join the group , according to Reuters ",0
Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernandez said in a public address on Tuesday evening some Hondurans in the caravan had already returned home and the government was preparing to support them ,0
He did not specify how many had turned back ,0
"Still , the caravan had grown to about 4,000 people today ",0

During World War II Cardinal Jozsef Mindszenty was a huge critic of fascism and wound up in prison ,0
In Oct. 1945 he became head of the Church in Hungary and spoke out just as strongly against Communist oppression ,0
"He wound up back in prison for eight more years , including long periods of solitary confinement and endured other forms of torture ",0
In 1949 he was sentenced to life in a show trial that generated worldwide condemnation ,1
"Two weeks after the trial began in early 1949 , Pope Pius XII ( having failed to speak out forcefully against the Third Reich ) did summon the courage to condemn what was happening to Mindszenty ",0
Pius excommunicated everyone involved in the Mindszenty trial ,0
"Then , addressing a huge crowd on St. Peter ’s Square , he asked , “ Do you want a Church that remains silent when she should speak … a Church that does not condemn the suppression of conscience and does not stand up for the just liberty of the people … a Church that locks herself up within the four walls of her temple in unseemly sycophancy … ? ” ",1
"When the Hungarian revolution broke out in 1956 , Mindszenty was freed , but only for four days ",0
"When Soviet tanks rolled back into Budapest , he fled to the U.S. embassy and was given immediate asylum by President Eisenhower ",0

"“ It seems altogether fitting and proper that this year ’s award be presented in London , where Edmund Burke coined the expression “ Fourth Estate ",0

"He suppressed what happened in Baghdad that day , dismissed it as simply “ one bad day in a surge that was filled with such days , ” and then had the temerity to lavish praise on the unit in a book he called “ The Good Soldiers ",1

"Trump calls on Sessions to stop Mueller ’s Russia probe , raising specter of attempted obstruction ",0
"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump called on Attorney General Jeff Sessions to “ stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now , ” opening the president to further complaints that he is trying to obstruct the investigation into Russia ’s election interference and his campaign ’s possible complicity ",1
Trump is already reportedly under investigation for potential obstruction of the Russia probe led by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III ,0
"The tweet early Wednesday was the president ’s most explicit post or statement to date seemingly aimed at getting his attorney general , the nation ’s top law enforcement officer , to end the probe ",1
"The tweet , along with several others Wednesday morning , accelerated the president ’s attacks on the investigation , which he claims is tainted by bias ",1
"They were likely prompted by the start of the trial on Tuesday of Paul Manafort , Trump ’s former campaign chairman , on 18 charges of tax evasion , bank fraud and conspiracy ",0
"“ This is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now , before it continues to stain our country any further ",1
"Bob Mueller is totally conflicted , and his 17 Angry Democrats that are doing his dirty work are a disgrace to USA ! ” Trump wrote ",1
"The president suggested in a subsequent tweet that Manafort was being treated worse than Al Capone , the notorious Prohibition - era Chicago gangster ",1
“ Where is the Russian Collusion ? ” Trump added ,0
"Trump ’s tweets prompted Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California , the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee , to accuse the president of obstruction “ hiding in plain sight ",1
” ,0
"“ The President of the United States just called on his Attorney General to put an end to an investigation in which the President , his family and campaign may be implicated , ” Schiff tweeted ",0
“ This is an attempt to obstruct justice hiding in plain sight ,1
America must never accept it ,1
” ,0
"Although the White House has said that Trump ’s tweets are official presidential statements , his lawyer , Rudolph W. Giuliani , responded to the latest one as he has before , by brushing off suggestions that Trump ’s tweets could be used as evidence of obstruction ",0
"“ The president was expressing his opinion on his favored medium for asserting his First Amendment right of free speech , ” Giuliani said in an interview ",0
"“ He said ‘ should,’ not ‘ must,’ and no presidential order was issued or will be ",0
” ,0
He said he spoke with Trump to make sure that the president was n’t actually issuing an order ,0
"“ I talked to him about it to make sure he was on the same page as we are , ” Giuliani said , and the president indicated he was not ordering Sessions to act ",0
"On Sunday , Giuliani told CBS’ “ Face the Nation ” : “ Obstruction by tweet is not something I think works real well ",0
"Generally obstruction is secret , it ’s clandestine , it ’s corrupt ",0
” ,0
"Giuliani added , “ I ’ve looked at all those tweets and they do n’t amount to anything ",1

"For months , Trump ’s lawyers also have argued that it ’s impossible for the president to obstruct justice because his constitutional authority extends over the Justice Department ",0
"That power allows him to direct officials where to focus their resources or to fire them when he chooses , as Trump did when removing James B. Comey as FBI director last year ",0
"That firing , however , led to Mueller ’s appointment as special counsel ",0
"Wednesday ’s tweet was a reminder of Trump ’s unabated anger at Sessions , who recused himself from overseeing the Russia investigation on March 2 , 2017 — as members of both parties and legal experts have contended that he should ",1
"Sessions pointed to Justice Department regulations to explain that , as one of Trump ’s earliest and most active supporters , he should n’t participate in the investigation of the Trump campaign ",1
"He announced the decision after controversy over his own undisclosed contacts , both during the campaign and the post - election transition , with the Russian ambassador at the time , Sergey Kislyak ",0
"Two months ago , Trump tweeted that he should have chosen a different person as attorney general who would n’t have needed to recuse himself ",1
“ I wish I did ! ” he wrote ,1
"In his tweets , Trump also quoted criticism of the investigation from Alan Dershowitz , a Harvard Law School professor who frequently defends Trump on television ",1
"In an interview with the Los Angeles Times , Dershowitz said he does not believe Sessions has the authority to end the probe ",1
"“ You ca n’t be both recused and making decisions about the investigation , ” he said ",1
But Dershowitz also cast doubt on whether Trump ’s tweets can be seen as an act of obstruction ,0
"“ You can not obstruct justice by openly exercising your First Amendment rights and openly criticizing a prosecution , whether you ’re right or wrong , ” he said ",0
"“ Obstruction of justice is generally committed behind the scenes , so I think both sides are a little overwrought here ",0

"Stephen Vladeck , a University of Texas law professor , agreed that Sessions can not stop the Russia investigation given that he recused himself ",0

"Pope Francis ' sexual abuse commission , hit by resignations and criticism , gets a reboot ",0
Last week Pope Francis announced he was reviving a panel he created to advise the Vatican on how to handle sexual abuse by clergy ,0
"The issue has dogged the Roman Catholic Church in recent years , and critics have accused Francis and his two predecessors , John Paul II and Benedict XVI , of failing to aggressively weed out and punish predator priests ",0
Here ’s a look what drove the panel ’s creation and what to expect in the future ,0
What is Pope Francis’ commission on sexual abuse ? ,0
"Following criticism he was not focusing on halting child abuse within the church , Francis created the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors in March 2014 , naming Cardinal Sean O’Malley , the archbishop of Boston , to run it ",0
"O’Malley was not only a member of the pope ’s “ G9 ” group of close advisors ; he was also the man who sought to clean up the abuse scandal in Boston after the departure of his predecessor , Cardinal Bernard Law , whose shifting of predator priests to new posts was exposed by the Boston Globe and chronicled in the movie “ Spotlight ",0
” ,0
"The revelations about Law , who died in December , emboldened abuse victims across the country and world , who began speaking up about the priests who had molested them ",0
"When he created the commission , Francis said : “ The commission ’s specific task is to propose to me the most opportune initiatives for protecting minors and vulnerable adults , in order that we may do everything possible to ensure that crimes such as those which have occurred are no longer repeated in the Church ",0
” ,0
Why is it being renewed now ? ,0
"After the commission ’s three - year mandate expired in December , Francis relaunched it on Feb. 17 with some members reappointed and nine new members added , some of whom are victims of abuse , although the Vatican declined to say which , opting to respect their privacy ",0
O’Malley returns as chief ,0
"New members come from Australia , Brazil , Ethiopia , India , the Netherlands and Tonga , """""""" reflecting the global reach of the church and the challenge of creating safeguarding structures in diverse cultural context , ” the Vatican said ",0
What did the first commission achieve ? ,0
"The Vatican has said it “ worked with almost 200 dioceses and religious communities worldwide to raise awareness and to educate people on the need for safeguarding in our homes , parishes , schools , hospitals , and other institutions ",0
” ,0
What did n’t it do ? ,0
Commission members quickly realized they needed to go beyond raising awareness and deal with the bishops who quietly shift offenders to new dioceses when they are exposed as molesters and rapists ,0
"Even if church laws already existed to hold bishops accountable for their priests’ behavior , those strictures were not enough , O’Malley said in 2014 ",0
"“ There are , theoretically I guess , canons that could apply here , but obviously they have not been sufficient , ” he said ",0
"The commission was behind Francis’ decision in 2015 to create a new tribunal to judge bishops caught covering up for abusive priests , and to fund it for five years ",1
"But amid myriad legal questions over what exact powers the court would have , it never got off the ground ",0
"In 2016 , Francis officially killed the plan to create it , issuing a document that essentially called on using existing procedures to tackle the problem ",0
"Francis was also criticized when Australian Cardinal George Pell , whom he had brought to Rome to clean up Vatican finances , was forced to return to Australia last year to face charges of sexual assault ",0
Any other problems ? ,0
"Commission members said bishops should call the police when they discovered predator priests , rather than phone the nearest religious retreat to “ park ” the priest out of harm ’s way ",1
But this simple message was hard to get across ,0
"It emerged that during a Vatican training course for new bishops in September 2015 a French priest informed bishops they had no obligation to report abuse to the police , forcing the commission to issue a strong statement saying bishops had every obligation to do so ",0
Did commission members persevere ? ,0
Not all of them ,0
"British member Peter Saunders , a former victim of priestly abuse , was ousted in 2016 ",0
"He said the group was a toothless , paper - shuffling exercise ",1
"Irish member Marie Collins , another victim , resigned in March last year and said Vatican bureaucrats had refused to comply with the commission ’s request — approved by the pope — to respond to all letters sent to the Vatican by abuse victims ",0
"Marie Collins , then a member of the pope 's sex abuse commission , in 2015 hands a letter to Cardinal Sean O'Malley detailing the abuse suffered by Juan Carlos Cruz of Chile ",0
Catherine Bonnet / Associated Press ,0
Was the pope listening to the commission ? ,0
Possibly not ,0
"In 2015 , Collins handed O’Malley a letter addressed to the pope from Juan Carlos Cruz , a Chilean abused as a boy by Chilean prelate Fernando Karadima , who was sentenced by the Vatican to a lifetime of penance in 2010 ",0
"Cruz described how the abuse was witnessed and covered up by Juan Barros , a priest whose appointment as a bishop in 2015 prompted huge protests in Chile ",0
"The pope has stuck by Barros , dismissing the protesters as “ lefties ” and hugging Barros publicly during his visit to Chile last month ",1
""""""""" I ca n't condemn [ Barros ] because I do n't have evidence , """""""" he said on the plane back to Rome , suggesting he had ignored or never read the letter from Cruz ",0
"That was too much for O’Malley , who said Francis had caused """""""" great pain ” to victims ",1
"If Francis was not listening to the commission about Barros , whom was he listening to ? ",1
"Vatican watchers believe the pope was influenced by Chilean Cardinal Francisco Javier Errazuriz , a member of the G9 group who has backed Barros and reportedly helped block moves to make Cruz a member of the abuse commission ",0
So is the pope intransigent on Barros ? ,0
No ,0
"Something changed his mind after his Chilean trip , possibly the scale of the protest against Barros in the country ",0
"On Feb. 17 , he sent a senior Vatican sex abuse investigator , Archbishop Charles Scicluna , to New York to interview Cruz , who now lives in Philadelphia ",0
""""""""" For the first time I felt that someone is listening , """""""" Cruz said after the meeting ",0
What happens next ? ,0
"“ This should lead to Barros stepping down , ” said Saunders , who is forming his own campaign group with Cruz and others to fight clerical abuse ",0

Kavanaugh Battle Brews ,0
"The Left ’s continuing success in delaying a confirmation vote on Judge Brett Kavanaugh ’s nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court reveals its malicious agenda to block the nominee from sitting on the high court when its new term begins Monday , October 1 ",1
Democrats had Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford ’s never - credible accusations of sexual abuse -- including possible attempted rape -- in hand way back in the summer ,1
"They deliberately refused to bring up the allegations , as weak and ridiculous as they are , at Kavanaugh ’s Senate confirmation hearings because they did n’t want to have a rational discussion ",1
They wanted to hurl the wild claims like a grenade at the last minute to blow up the process ,1
And so far it appears they ’re succeeding ,0
"If Kavanaugh is n’t in place a week from Monday , the Supreme Court will begin hearing cases in its new term shorthanded ",0
"The high court normally has a complement of nine justices but with Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy ’s retirement July 31 , which cleared the way for Kavanaugh ’s nomination , there have only been eight justices in place ",0
Roughly speaking there is a 4-to-4 liberal to conservative ideological split on the court ,0
Democrats would prefer to drag the confirmation process into the next Congress where they hope to take control from Republicans ,0
Election Day is November 6 ,0
"The GOP currently controls the Senate , which has the final say on judicial nominations , by an uncomfortably close margin of 51 to 49 ",0
Christine Blasey Ford ’s lawyers are trying to game the system ,0
They know that Senate Judiciary Committee rules require Chairman Chuck Grassley ( R - Iowa ) to provide a full week ’s notice for a hearing ,0
"So , if , for example , the committee followed the rules and agreed Friday ( today ) to a hearing , the soonest it could be held would be next Friday , the final business day before the Supreme Court ’s new term begins ",0
"Of course , lawyers are masters of delay , and social justice warrior - lawyers hoping to torpedo President Trump ’s agenda have an added incentive to drag the confirmation process out as long as possible ",1
New demands and fake emergencies are bound to arise from Ford ’s legal team ,0
It was unclear at press time if the public hearing scheduled for Monday into the allegations of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh would go forward ,0
Kavanaugh informed the committee he was willing to testify Monday ,0
"“ I continue to want a hearing as soon as possible , so that I can clear my name , """""""" he wrote in a letter ",0
"Ford 's lawyer Debra Katz told the Judiciary Committee her client """""""" wishes to testify , provided that we can agree on terms that are fair and which ensure her safety ",0
""""""""" ",0
Another Ford attorney reportedly said Wednesday that there are “ multiple witnesses ” who need to testify ,0
""""""""" A hearing on Monday is not possible and the Committee 's insistence that it occur then is arbitrary in any event , ” Katz wrote in a letter ",0
“ Dr. ,0
Ford has asked me to let you know that she appreciates the various options you have suggested ,0
Her strong preference continues to be for the Senate Judiciary Committee to allow for a full investigation prior to her testimony ,0
” ,0
"GOP lawmakers are figuring out how to respond to Ford ’s request , the San Diego Union - Tribune reports : ",0
"Late Thursday , Sen. Charles E. Grassley ( R - Iowa ) , the Judiciary Committee chairman , said that his staff had discussed the issue with Ford ’s attorney earlier in the day and that he would consult with his fellow committee members about the next move ",0
Ford ’s offer also increased the pressure on several key moderates — particularly GOP Sens ,0
Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska — whose votes will probably be needed to put Kavanaugh on the high court ,0
"Both were already facing heavy pressure from abortion rights groups concerned that Kavanaugh , a staunch conservative and longtime GOP attorney , might vote to restrict access to abortion ",1
"The sexual assault allegation , which the nominee has denied , has upended his seemingly sure - bet confirmation and only increased the stakes for the key lawmakers ",0
Chairman Grassley had imposed a Thursday deadline for Ford to submit testimony after her team said Tuesday she was n’t willing to testify until the FBI investigates her sexual abuse allegations against Kavanaugh ,0
Left - wingers such as Hillary Clinton and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ( D - N.Y. ) echoed Ford ’s demand ,1
"The demand for an FBI probe is “ utter nonsense , ” former U.S. Attorney Joseph diGenova said earlier this week ",1
"Ford “ really does n’t want to testify , ” he said ",0
"“ Because when she does , she is going to look like the loon she is ",1
"She may very well believe everything she ’s saying , and that is one of the signs of lunacy , believing something that is n’t real ",0
” And her lawyer is “ even loonier ,1
” ,0
"Besides , diGenova explained , the eleventh - hour sexual abuse claim leveled against Kavanaugh is a non - federal matter and in this case the alleged assault has n’t even been clearly outlined by the alleged victim ",0
"Ford did n’t report it to anyone for decades and is n’t even certain when or where it happened , so the FBI ca n’t investigate the matter “ because there is nothing to investigate ",0
” ,0
Kavanaugh has already undergone six FBI background checks and the agency has ruled out investigating Ford ’s allegation of drunken groping at a teenagers’ party 36 years ago ,0
"Ford ’s request for an FBI probe is “ clearly a desire to delay proceedings , ” diGenova said ",1
"President Trump is taking the high road and is avoiding attacking Ford , which is n’t a risky move given how obviously unbalanced the accuser is ",1
Ford is already doing an excellent job destroying herself without Republican assistance ,1
"At the White House on Wednesday , President Trump said it would be """""""" wonderful """""""" if Ford testifies and """""""" unfortunate """""""" if she does not ",0
"He indicated he was keeping an open mind about the allegations but that it was """""""" very hard for me to imagine anything happened """""""" between her and the nominee ",0
""""""""" I think he 's an extraordinary man – I think he 's a man of great intellect , as I 've been telling you , and he has an unblemished record , """""""" Trump said ",1
""""""""" This is a very tough thing for him and his family and we want to get over it but at the same time we want to give tremendous amounts of time ",0
If she shows up that would be wonderful – if she does n't show up that would be unfortunate ,0

WATCH : John Bolton Promises Room Full of ‘ Former Terrorists’ the US Would ‘ Overthrow’ Iran by 2019 ,0
"For those who may not be paying attention , the plan to overthrow Iran has long been in the works ",0
"In fact , in April 2012 , Pulitzer Prize - winning journalist , Seymour Hersh reported that the U.S. Joint Special Operations Command had trained ( Mojahedin - e Khalq ) MEK operatives at a secret site in Nevada from 2005 to 2009 for this very purpose ",0
MEK is the Iranian political - militant organization that advocates for the violent overthrow of the current Iranian regime ,0
They are hardly quiet about it ,0
"Coincidentally , MEK was classified as a terrorist organization by the United States and its allies — during this training period — until none other than Hillary Clinton suddenly removed them from the list in 2012 ",1
"According to Hersh , MEK members were trained in intercepting communications , cryptography , weaponry and small unit tactics at the Nevada site until President Barack Obama took office in 2009 ",0

It was widely reported that the MEK was behind the anti - government violence that erupted in Iran in January which snowballed into the situation today ,0
"Hersh also reported additional names of former U.S. officials paid to speak in support of MEK , including former CIA directors James Woolsey and Porter Goss ; New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani ; former Vermont Governor Howard Dean ; former Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Louis Freeh and former U.N. ",0
Ambassador John Bolton ,0
"For over a decade , Bolton has been calling for regime change in Iran ",0
"Now , he ’s the National Security Advisor ",0
It just so happens that at least one of these calls for regime change in Iran was caught on video last year as Bolton gave a speech at the Grand Gathering of Iranians for Free Iran ,1
"“ There is a viable opposition to the rule of the ayatollahs , and that opposition is centered in this room today ",0
"I had said for over 10 years since coming to these events , that the declared policy of the United States of America should be the overthrow of the mullahs’ regime in Tehran ",0
"The behavior and the objectives of the regime are not going to change , and therefore the only solution is to change the regime itself ",0
"And that ’s why , before 2019 , we here will celebrate in Tehran ! ” ",0
Pay attention to the first line in that quote above in which Bolton notes that the opposition needed to overthrow Iran ’s current regime “ is centered in this room today ,0
” Who was in that room ? ,1
"Well , the entire event was actually put on by the People ’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran , also known as the Mojahedin - e Khalq or MEK ",0
"As Politico pointed out in a 2016 article , despite the neocon attempts to rewrite history , MEK have killed Americans and committed multiple acts of terrorism ",0
"For decades , and based on U.S. intelligence , the United States government has blamed the MEK for killing three U.S. Army colonels and three U.S. contractors , bombing the facilities of numerous U.S. companies and killing innocent Iranians ",0
"To recap , the formerly terrorist - classified organization MEK , trained in the US and granted special privilege status by then - Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2012—which has since been heavily funded to refine their image by having famous US neoconservative war hawks from both sides of the isle actually chant for “ regime change ” on their behalf — is now the darling child of the neocon agenda and the impetus behind what could kick of World War 3 ",1
"While the current Iranian regime is certainly no bastion of freedom , the idea that US intervention or a violent revolution would be beneficial for the people of Iran or American citizens is outright insane ",1
"To see what US intervention — through military support and the support of opposition groups — does to countries , one need only look at Syria , Iraq , Afghanistan , and Libya to see the horrific death tolls and war - ravaged dystopias left in America ’s wake ",1
"To those paying attention over the years , Trump ’s desire to intervene in Iran , and his subsequent support in the media and from all sides of the political spectrum should come as no surprise as it has been the plan since Bill Clinton was in office and was documented in the neoconservative PNAC report ",0
"This was even admitted by General Wesley Clark , former Supreme Allied Commander of NATO , that the U.S. planned on going to war with Iran , according to a 2001 memo from the U.S. Secretary of Defense ",0
"“ This is a memo that describes how we ’re going to take out seven countries in five years , ” Clark said ",0
"“ Starting with Iraq , and then Syria , Lebanon , Libya , Somalia , Sudan , and finishing off with Iran ",0

"With the hindsight of 52 years and a great deal of very dirty and unappealing water under the Catholic bridge , we can see it as a kind of warning prophecy ",1
"Published just three months before the close of Vatican II and just as Annibale Bugnini was cranking open the floodgates of his never - ending stream of liturgical alterations , Mysterium Fidei is now an important marker of a critical turning point in Catholic history , perhaps the most important of modern times ",0
Who can read this without cringing at what we now know was about to happen : ,1
"Therefore , we earnestly hope that the restored sacred liturgy will bring forth abundant fruits of eucharistic devotion , so that the Holy Church , under this saving sign of piety , may make daily progress toward perfect unity and may invite all Christians to a unity of faith and of love , drawing them gently , thanks to the action of divine grace ",0
"But in 1983 at the start of my personal investigations into the Catholic religion , I knew nothing of any of that ",0
"The encyclical , the very first I ever read , was also a marker for me of a personal turning point ",0
It was the first time I had ever seen Catholic eucharistic doctrine clearly and – most importantly – unapologetically stated ,0
"It came right out and said something so astounding , something so completely unlikely , that I had to admit that it left very few logical possibilities ",0
Like C.S. ,0
"Lewis ’s assessment of the claims by Christ of His own divinity , this pope was either mad , bad or telling the plain truth ",0
"Something that may be much more noteworthy now in our current circumstances than it was the year I read it , is that the pope ’s very first quote was not of scripture , but the Council of Trent : ",0
"“ At the Last Supper , on the night He was handed over , Our Lord instituted the Eucharistic Sacrifice of His Body and Blood , to perpetuate the sacrifice of the cross throughout the ages until He should come , and thus entrust to the Church , His beloved spouse , the memorial of His death and resurrection : a sacrament of devotion , a sign of unity , a bond of charity , a paschal banquet in which Christ is received , the soul is filled with grace and there is given to us the pledge of future glory ",0
” ,0
"In these words are highlighted both the sacrifice , which pertains to the essence of the Mass which is celebrated daily , and the sacrament in which the faithful participate in Holy Communion by eating the Flesh of Christ and drinking His Blood , receiving both grace , the beginning of eternal life , and the medicine of immortality ",0
I remember my thoughts upon reading this shocking statement … “ By doing what ? ,0
! ” ,0
"My acceptance from the reading of this document of the Church ’s orthodox eucharistic doctrine was based in part on Pope Paul ’s gracious and beautiful exposition , and in part on the sheer radical , mad unlikeliness of it ",1
What could conceivably be the reason to say anything as wild as this if it were n’t true ? ,0
The idea of transubstantiation struck me as I read that document as possibly the strangest and most earth shattering thing I ’d ever heard ,1
It shocked me out of a kind of swamp of intellectual worldliness ; presenting the idea to my thirsty mind that there could indeed be fantastic realities far more wonderful than the banal and painfully uninteresting secularist worldview I had been taught to accept ,1
"It was as though someone had plausibly told me that , yes , there were fairies and magical kingdoms in real life , “ just around the corner ” ",1
"By the time I read it , I had been through a long , slow transition from a childhood devoted to Our Lady and confirmed in my belief in wonders , to a kind of disappointed practical atheism after three years in a diocesan Catholic parochial school ",0
"I had been taught , by both word and implication , that everything the Catholic Church had taught before Vatican II was pernicious nonsense ",1
Where it was simply wrong it was ridiculous and where it was wrong and political it was outright wicked ,1
What led me to read that particular encyclical is the most clearly identifiable moment of actual grace in my young life to that point ,0
"It was the first time it occurred to me to investigate , like an anthropologist , what the Church herself said about her teachings ",0
"While mulling grimly one day over all the wickedness of the Catholic Church , I was pulled up short by a single thought : “ I could be wrong ",0
” At 17 it seemed such an unlikely thing to think I was rather shocked ,0
"But stopping a moment to consider , I realised that I had only ever heard about Catholic things from people who clearly hated the Church ; her enemies , in short ",0
It hardly seemed just to convict on the testimony of these obviously biased witnesses ,0
"In order to properly and thoroughly condemn the Church , with convincing due diligence , I had to read something about it that did n’t come from her enemies ",0
"The same day , I presented myself at the reference desk of the public library and asked , “ Do you have any books about Catholicism ? ",0
"Something official ? ” The librarian took me to the reference section and showed me the shelves of encyclicals , documents and histories ",0
Saints and popes from one end of the stacks to the other ,0
"Having no clear idea what my own question meant , I just picked one at random ",0
"The description of the Holy Eucharist as the supreme Centre from which all our life as Catholics flow , and from which all other doctrines radiated , was something that was not going to come into my head for another eight years of reading ",0
"But even so , Mysterium Fidei forced me to face up to a reality I ’d never dreamed of before ; that this , the little unassuming wafer , was the most important thing in the world ",0
"Reading through the encyclical again , holding it up next to the current situation in Rome , makes it easier to clarify certain critical issues ",0
"Given what we are now seeing , consider the poignancy of the following passages : ",0
"When dealing with the restoration of the sacred liturgy , the Fathers of the council , by reason of their pastoral concern for the whole Church , considered it of the highest importance to exhort the faithful to participate actively with sound faith and with the utmost devotion in the celebration of this Most Holy Mystery , to offer it with the priest to God as a sacrifice for their own salvation and for that of the whole world , and to find in it spiritual nourishment ",0
"This was , remember , 1965 , four years before the New Mass was issued and before Cardinal Ottaviani warned the pope that it was precisely this sacramental reality that was about to be catastrophically obscured ",1
"Who , reading this passage , does not feel the urge to shout down the years , to do something to stave off the disaster that was coming : ",0
"[ W]e are aware of the fact that , among those who deal with this Most Holy Mystery in written or spoken word , there are some who with reference either to Masses which are celebrated in private , or to the dogma of transubstantiation , or to devotion to the Eucharist , spread abroad opinions which disturb the faithful and fill their minds with no little confusion about matters of faith ",0
"It is as if everyone were permitted to consign to oblivion doctrine already defined by the Church , or else to interpret it in such a way as to weaken the genuine meaning of the words or the recognized force of the concepts involved ",0
"Keeping Cardinal Ottaviani ’s Intervention directly before our thoughts , we read with a strange kind of helpless dread … ",0
"… it is not allowable to emphasize what is called the “ communal ” Mass to the disparagement of Masses celebrated in private , or to exaggerate the element of sacramental sign as if the symbolism , which all certainly admit in the Eucharist , expresses fully and exhausts completely the mode of Christ ’s presence in this sacrament ",1
"Nor is it allowable to discuss the mystery of transubstantiation without mentioning what the Council of Trent stated about the marvelous conversion of the whole substance of the bread into the Body and of the whole substance of the wine into the Blood of Christ , speaking rather only of what is called “ transignification ” and “ transfiguration , ” or finally to propose and act upon the opinion according to which , in the Consecrated Hosts which remain after the celebration of the sacrifice of the Mass , Christ Our Lord is no longer present ",1
"And therefore , so that the hope aroused by the council , that a flourishing of eucharistic piety which is now pervading the whole Church , be not frustrated by this spread of false opinions , we have with apostolic authority decided to address you , venerable brothers , and to express our mind on this subject ",0
[ 1 ] ,0
Those of us writing similar jeremiads now have been working to clarify that the attack from Rome on the moral doctrine of the Church is n’t about marriage ,0
It ’s about the Eucharist and to a lesser extent the priesthood ,0
The demonic forces we know are the driving force behind this supreme moment of heresy and destruction are n’t really looking at the undermining of marriage as their primary goal ; they want to get at the Eucharist ,1
We know it is demonically inspired because their hatred is for Christ Himself in the first place and for anyone who loves and wants to serve Him second ,1
They are men who refuse to bend the knee before the God whom they will not serve ,1
This knowledge – that the attack is on the Body and Blood of Christ – can also help readers spot their friends in the crowd ,0
The places where Eucharistic adoration is still offered are places where at least some flicker of the true Faith survives ,0
"The bishops and priests now talking about the supreme glory of the Eucharist , and the need to defend it from sacrilege , are lighthouses ",0
"A case in point is Bishop Mark Davies , of my own former diocese of Shrewsbury in England ",0
"In March , 2016 , in the midst of the shouting from Rome , Bishop Davies spoke at his Chrism Mass said that only through the “ reality of the Eucharist ” could new vocations to the priesthood be found ",0
“ In treasuring this gift of priestly celibacy we need to recognize more clearly the intimate link between the Ministerial Priesthood and the reality of the Eucharist ,0
"If the Mass were ever reduced in our minds to being merely a commemorative meal and the priest as only a community leader or functionary , then the celibacy of the Catholic Priesthood might seem extravagant ",1
” ,0
It ’s almost as if someone had slipped a copy of the Ottaviani Intervention inside his morning paper ,0
"The targeting of marriage , through the instruments of creatures like the myopic and theologically tunnel - visioned Cardinal Kasper , is demonically brilliant ",1
It ’s a “ stitch - up ” as the English call it ; a fix ,0
"You make it a matter of “ mercy ” ( backed up by the iron fist ) that no one in a state of objective mortal sin can be refused Holy Communion ; you give the national bishops conferences the power to start enforcing this , and you have created a previously unimaginable situation in the Church ",0
"You have created a regime in which a refusal to desecrate the sacred species will be grounds for persecution of faithful priests , seminarians and laity ",0
"And of course , we are seeing it starting already ",0
"It ’s a brilliant strategy , the magic bullet that will revert the Church to the 1976 model on every front , and very likely keep it there forever ",0
As if the goal was to go back in time and erase the entire John Paul II / Benedict XVI period out of history ,0
"It will halt the revival of eucharistic piety among seminarians ; in fact , it will reverse the general reforming trend of “ conservative ” seminaries that was such a feature under John Paul II and has for 30 years been the hook upon which all hopes of restoration have hung ",0
It is easy to see what is coming next ,0
"Once certain announcements are published in parish bulletins , laity will have to consider whether they can , in conscience , continue to assist at Masses where systematic sacrilege has been formally adopted as the rule ",0
The few bishops with sufficient spine to stand up to the pressure of both Rome and their own national conferences – newly empowered with directives to make doctrinal declarations – will be ruling embattled islands of Catholicism in a poisoned sea of systematic heresy and desecration ,1
"A dark , impenetrable and “ irreversible ” winter of persecution of the faithful by their own shepherds will fall ",1
"Not being a theologian I have no idea if this encyclical is , as so many of these seemingly orthodox documents of that period seem to be , rife with the usual “ time bombs , ” ambiguities , mushy language or even outright errors ",0
I have n’t looked it up ,0
I ’m sure there are plenty of people out there qualified to examine it to see if it ’s safe for Trad - Catholic consumption ,0
"And I have no doubt at all that there are better , more venerable , even more sublime and poignant works on the Eucharist in the canon of “ official ” things ",0
"From saints and Doctors of the Church and whatnot , many of which the pope cited ",0
"But whatever its flaws , Mysterium Fidei is the one I found , and I ’m convinced it was n’t an accident ",1
"O God , in Your infinite mercy , forgive and have mercy on Pope Paul VI Montini for whatever neglect or damage of which he may have been guilty ",0
"In this one case at least , a work of his was the exact right thing at the exact right time ",0
For me at least it was the key that opened the Door to Narnia ,0
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ,0
"[ 1 ] The fact that four years before the New Mass was issued , Paul VI was pinpointing in such detail exactly what Bugnini and co. were preparing makes it all but impossible to escape the conclusion that he knew perfectly well what was coming but approved the disastrous New Rite anyway ",0
And then did nothing but weep as the inevitable disaster unfolded ,0

Brett Kavanaugh accused in letter obtained by FBI of drunkenly forcing himself on woman while in high school ; Kavanaugh denies it happened ,0
"According to the New York Daily News , Brett Kavanaugh , President Donald Trump ’s Supreme Court nominee , held a woman down , covered her mouth and tried to force himself on her while drunk at a party in high school ",0
That ’s the nexus of a letter allegedly acquired by Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein in July but dropped on the last days before the vote for Kavanaugh ’s confirmation ,0
"The unidentified woman says the incident took place at a party in the early 1980s while Kavanaugh was a student at Georgetown Preparatory School in Bethesda , Md. , according to the NYDN , which claims to have obtained the letter on Friday ",0
"She alleges Kavanaugh and a friend of his , both of whom had been drinking , cornered her in a room and turned up the music to blur out the sound of her protests ",0
"Kavanaugh then allegedly covered the woman ’s mouth with his hand and attempted to force himself on her , but she says she managed to free herself and bolt out of the room ",0
"Kavanaugh , 53 , vehemently denied the woman ’s allegations ",1

“ I did not do this back in high school or at any time ,0
” ,0
"Kavanaugh ’s friend , who has not been identified , did not outright deny the woman ’s claims but told the New Yorker he has “ no recollection of that ",0

The woman says she has had to undergo psychological treatment as a result of the incident ,0
"She first approached her congresswoman , Anna Eshoo , D - Calif ",0

Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange ,1
"It is welcome that finally there has been a little pushback , including from leading journalists , to the Guardian ’s long - running vilification of Julian Assange , the founder of Wikileaks ",1
"Reporter Luke Harding ’s latest article , claiming that Donald Trump ’s disgraced former campaign manager Paul Manafort secretly visited Assange in Ecuador ’s embassy in London on three occasions , is so full of holes that even hardened opponents of Assange in the corporate media are struggling to stand by it ",1
"Faced with the backlash , the Guardian quickly – and very quietly – rowed back its initial certainty that its story was based on verified facts ",1
"Instead , it amended the text , without acknowledging it had done so , to attribute the claims to unnamed , and uncheckable , “ sources ” ",1
The propaganda function of the piece is patent ,1
"It is intended to provide evidence for long - standing allegations that Assange conspired with Trump , and Trump ’s supposed backers in the Kremlin , to damage Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential race ",0
The Guardian ’s latest story provides a supposedly stronger foundation for an existing narrative : that Assange and Wikileaks knowingly published emails hacked by Russia from the Democratic party ’s servers ,1
"In truth , there is no public evidence that the emails were hacked , or that Russia was involved ",1
Central actors have suggested instead that the emails were leaked from within the Democratic party ,1
"Nonetheless , this unverified allegation has been aggressively exploited by the Democratic leadership because it shifts attention away both from its failure to mount an effective electoral challenge to Trump and from the damaging contents of the emails ",1
"These show that party bureaucrats sought to rig the primaries to make sure Clinton ’s challenger for the Democratic nomination , Bernie Sanders , lost ",0
"To underscore the intended effect of the Guardian ’s new claims , Harding even throws in a casual and unsubstantiated reference to “ Russians ” joining Manafort in supposedly meeting Assange ",1
"Manafort has denied the Guardian ’s claims , while Assange has threatened to sue the Guardian for libel ",0
‘ Responsible for Trump’ ,0
The emotional impact of the Guardian story is to suggest that Assange is responsible for four years or more of Trump rule ,0
"But more significantly , it bolsters the otherwise risible claim that Assange is not a publisher – and thereby entitled to the protections of a free press , as enjoyed by the Guardian or the New York Times – but the head of an organisation engaged in espionage for a foreign power ",1
"The intention is to deeply discredit Assange , and by extension the Wikileaks organisation , in the eyes of right - thinking liberals ",0
"That , in turn , will make it much easier to silence Assange and the vital cause he represents : the use of new media to hold to account the old , corporate media and political elites through the imposition of far greater transparency ",0
"The Guardian story will prepare public opinion for the moment when Ecuador ’s rightwing government under President Lenin Moreno forces Assange out of the embassy , having already withdrawn most of his rights to use digital media ",0
It will soften opposition when the UK moves to arrest Assange on self - serving bail violation charges and extradites him to the US ,0
And it will pave the way for the US legal system to lock Assange up for a very long time ,0
"For the best part of a decade , any claims by Assange ’s supporters that avoiding this fate was the reason Assange originally sought asylum in the embassy was ridiculed by corporate journalists , not least at the Guardian ",1
"Even when a United Nations panel of experts in international law ruled in 2016 that Assange was being arbitrarily – and unlawfully – detained by the UK , Guardian writers led efforts to discredit the UN report ",1
See here and here ,0
Now Assange and his supporters have been proved right once again ,0
An administrative error this month revealed that the US justice department had secretly filed criminal charges against Assange ,0
Heavy surveillance ,0
"The problem for the Guardian , which should have been obvious to its editors from the outset , is that any visits by Manafort would be easily verifiable without relying on unnamed “ sources ” ",1
"Glenn Greenwald is far from alone in noting that London is possibly the most surveilled city in the world , with CCTV cameras everywhere ",0
"The environs of the Ecuadorian embassy are monitored especially heavily , with continuous filming by the UK and Ecuadorian authorities and most likely by the US and other actors with an interest in Assange ’s fate ",0
"The idea that Manafort or “ Russians ” could have wandered into the embassy to meet Assange even once without their trail , entry and meeting being intimately scrutinised and recorded is simply preposterous ",1
"According to Greenwald : “ If Paul Manafort … visited Assange at the Embassy , there would be ample amounts of video and other photographic proof demonstrating that this happened ",1
The Guardian provides none of that ,1
” ,0
Former British ambassador Craig Murray also points out the extensive security checks insisted on by the embassy to which any visitor to Assange must submit ,0
Any visits by Manafort would have been logged ,0
"In fact , the Guardian obtained the embassy ’s logs in May , and has never made any mention of either Manafort or “ Russians ” being identified in them ",1
It did not refer to the logs in its latest story ,1
Murray : ,0
The problem with this latest fabrication is that [ Ecuador ’s President ] Moreno had already released the visitor logs to the Mueller inquiry ,1
Neither Manafort nor these “ Russians ” are in the visitor logs … What possible motive would the Ecuadorean government have for facilitating secret unrecorded visits by Paul Manafort ? ,1
Furthermore it is impossible that the intelligence agency – who were in charge of the security – would not know the identity of these alleged “ Russians ” ,1
No fact - checking ,1
"It is worth noting it should be vitally important for a serious publication like the Guardian to ensure its claims are unassailably true – both because Assange ’s personal fate rests on their veracity , and because , even more importantly , a fundamental right , the freedom of the press , is at stake ",1
"Given this , one would have expected the Guardian ’s editors to have insisted on the most stringent checks imaginable before going to press with Harding ’s story ",1
"At a very minimum , they should have sought out a response from Assange and Manafort before publication ",1
Neither precaution was taken ,1
"I worked for the Guardian for a number of years , and know well the layers of checks that any highly sensitive story has to go through before publication ",1
"In that lengthy process , a variety of commissioning editors , lawyers , backbench editors and the editor herself , Kath Viner , would normally insist on cuts to anything that could not be rigorously defended and corroborated ",1
"And yet this piece seems to have been casually waved through , given a green light even though its profound shortcomings were evident to a range of well - placed analysts and journalists from the outset ",1
That at the very least hints that the Guardian thought they had “ insurance ” on this story ,0
"And the only people who could have promised that kind of insurance are the security and intelligence services – presumably of Britain , the United States and / or Ecuador ",0
"It appears the Guardian has simply taken this story , provided by spooks , at face value ",1
"Even if it later turns out that Manafort did visit Assange , the Guardian clearly had no compelling evidence for its claims when it published them ",1
That is profoundly irresponsible journalism – fake news – that should be of the gravest concern to readers ,1
"A pattern , not an aberration ",0
"Despite all this , even analysts critical of the Guardian ’s behaviour have shown a glaring failure to understand that its latest coverage represents not an aberration by the paper but decisively fits with a pattern ",1
"Glenn Greenwald , who once had an influential column in the Guardian until an apparent , though unacknowledged , falling out with his employer over the Edward Snowden revelations , wrote a series of baffling observations about the Guardian ’s latest story ",1
"First , he suggested it was simply evidence of the Guardian ’s long - standing ( and well - documented ) hostility towards Assange ",1
"“ The Guardian , an otherwise solid and reliable paper , has such a pervasive and unprofessionally personal hatred for Julian Assange that it has frequently dispensed with all journalistic standards in order to malign him ",1
” ,0
It was also apparently evidence of the paper ’s clickbait tendencies : ,1
"“ They [ Guardian editors ] knew that publishing this story would cause partisan warriors to excitedly spread the story , and that cable news outlets would hyperventilate over it , and that they ’d reap the rewards regardless of whether the story turned out to be true or false ",1
” ,0
"And finally , in a bizarre tweet , Greenwald opined , “ I hope the story [ maligning Assange ] turns out true ” – apparently because maintenance of the Guardian ’s reputation is more important than Assange ’s fate and the right of journalists to dig up embarrassing secrets without fear of being imprisoned ",1
I think the Guardian is an important paper with great journalists ,0
I hope the story turns out true ,0
"But the skepticism over this story is very widespread , including among Assange 's most devoted haters , because it 's so sketchy ",1
"If Manafort went there , there 's video ",0
Let 's see it ,0
"— Glenn Greenwald ( @ggreenwald ) November 28 , 2018 ",0
Deeper malaise ,0
What this misses is that the Guardian ’s attacks on Assange are not exceptional or motivated solely by personal animosity ,0
They are entirely predictable and systematic ,0
"Rather than being the reason for the Guardian violating basic journalistic standards and ethics , the paper ’s hatred of Assange is a symptom of a deeper malaise in the Guardian and the wider corporate media ",1
"Even aside from its decade - long campaign against Assange , the Guardian is far from “ solid and reliable ” , as Greenwald claims ",1
"It has been at the forefront of the relentless , and unhinged , attacks on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn for prioritising the rights of Palestinians over Israel ’s right to continue its belligerent occupation ",1
"Over the past three years , the Guardian has injected credibility into the Israel lobby ’s desperate efforts to tar Corbyn as an anti - semite ",1
"See here , here and here ",0
"Similarly , the Guardian worked tirelessly to promote Clinton and undermine Sanders in the 2016 Democratic nomination process – another reason the paper has been so assiduous in promoting the idea that Assange , aided by Russia , was determined to promote Trump over Clinton for the presidency ",1
"The Guardian ’s coverage of Latin America , especially of populist leftwing governments that have rebelled against traditional and oppressive US hegemony in the region , has long grated with analysts and experts ",1
"Its especial venom has been reserved for leftwing figures like Venezuela ’s Hugo Chavez , democratically elected but official enemies of the US , rather than the region ’s rightwing authoritarians beloved of Washington ",1
"The Guardian has been vocal in the so - called “ fake news ” hysteria , decrying the influence of social media , the only place where leftwing dissidents have managed to find a small foothold to promote their politics and counter the corporate media narrative ",1
"The Guardian has painted social media chiefly as a platform overrun by Russian trolls , arguing that this should justify ever - tighter restrictions that have so far curbed critical voices of the dissident left more than the right ",1
Heroes of the neoliberal order ,0
"Equally , the Guardian has made clear who its true heroes are ",1
"Certainly not Corbyn or Assange , who threaten to disrupt the entrenched neoliberal order that is hurtling us towards climate breakdown and economic collapse ",1
"Its pages , however , are readily available to the latest effort to prop up the status quo from Tony Blair , the man who led Britain , on false pretences , into the largest crime against humanity in living memory – the attack on Iraq ",1
"That “ humanitarian intervention ” cost the lives of many hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and created a vacuum that destabilised much of the Middle East , sucked in Islamic jihadists like al - Qaeda and ISIS , and contributed to the migrant crisis in Europe that has fuelled the resurgence of the far - right ",1
None of that is discussed in the Guardian or considered grounds for disqualifying Blair as an arbiter of what is good for Britain and the world ’s future ,1
"The Guardian also has an especial soft spot for blogger Elliot Higgins , who , aided by the Guardian , has shot to unlikely prominence as a self - styled “ weapons expert ” ",1
"Like Luke Harding , Higgins invariably seems ready to echo whatever the British and American security services need verifying “ independently ” ",1
"Higgins and his well - staffed website Bellingcat have taken on for themselves the role of arbiters of truth on many foreign affairs issues , taking a prominent role in advocating for narratives that promote US and NATO hegemony while demonising Russia , especially in highly contested arenas such as Syria ",1
"That clear partisanship should be no surprise , given that Higgins now enjoys an “ academic ” position at , and funding from , the Atlantic Council , a high - level , Washington - based think - tank founded to drum up support for NATO and justify its imperialist agenda ",1
"Improbably , the Guardian has adopted Higgins as the poster - boy for a supposed citizen journalism it has sought to undermine as “ fake news ” whenever it occurs on social media without the endorsement of state - backed organisations ",1
"The truth is that the Guardian has not erred in this latest story attacking Assange , or in its much longer - running campaign to vilify him ",1
"With this story , it has done what it regularly does when supposedly vital western foreign policy interests are at stake – it simply regurgitates an elite - serving , western narrative ",1
"Its job is to shore up a consensus on the left for attacks on leading threats to the existing , neoliberal order : whether they are a platform like Wikileaks promoting whistle - blowing against a corrupt western elite ; or a politician like Jeremy Corbyn seeking to break apart the status quo on the rapacious financial industries or Israel - Palestine ; or a radical leader like Hugo Chavez who threatened to overturn a damaging and exploitative US dominance of “ America ’s backyard ” ; or social media dissidents who have started to chip away at the elite - friendly narratives of corporate media , including the Guardian ",1
The Guardian did not make a mistake in vilifying Assange without a shred of evidence ,1
It did what it is designed to do ,1
"UPDATE : Excellent background from investigative journalist Gareth Porter , published shortly before Harding ’s story , explains why the Guardian ’s hit - piece is so important for those who want Assange out of the embassy and behind bars ",1

"Newt Gingrich : The truth about Trump , Putin , and Obama ",0
President Trump ’s summit Monday with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki created a firestorm of controversy ,1
President Trump seemed to be publicly siding with the Russian dictator against the American intelligence agencies ,1
The initial appearance was so bad that I tweeted : “ President Trump must clarify his statements in Helsinki on our intelligence system and Putin ,1
It is the most serious mistake of his presidency and must be corrected – immediately ,1
” ,0
"After flying home from Helsinki and reviewing the tape and transcript of his press conference with Putin , President Trump said he has “ full faith and support for America ’s great intelligence agencies ” and that he accepts “ our intelligence community ’s conclusion that Russia ’s meddling in the 2016 election took place ",1
” ,0
"In his remarks to members of Congress Tuesday that were televised by the media , President Trump went on to admit that he realized he needed to clarify his statements in Helsinki ",0
"The president said : “ It should have been obvious – I thought it would be obvious – but I would like to clarify , just in case it was n’t ",0
"In a key sentence in my remarks , I said the word ‘ would’ instead of “ would n’t ",0
” The sentence should have been : I do n’t see any reason why I would n’t – or why it would n’t be Russia ,0
"So just to repeat it , I said the word ‘ would’ instead of ‘ wouldn’t’ … ",0
"“ I have , on numerous occasions , noted our intelligence findings that Russians attempted to interfere in our elections ",1
"Unlike previous administrations , my administration has and will continue to move aggressively to repeal any efforts – and repel – we will stop it , we will repel it – any efforts to interfere in our elections ",1
We ’re doing everything in our power to prevent Russian interference in 2018 ,1
” ,0
Anyone who has studied President Trump knows he hates to admit a mistake ,0
His natural pattern is to move forward and ignore mistakes ,0
"For him , this was a big correction ( and as I noted the day before , it was an absolutely necessary one ) ",0
President Trump then reminded everyone of the Obama administration ’s failures in dealing with Russian meddling in the election ,1
"President Trump noted that President Obama and his advisers had information that the Russians had been working to interfere in the election and they ignored it , because they thought Hillary Clinton was going to win ",1
"President Trump said : “ President Obama , along with ( then - CIA Director John ) Brennan and ( then Director of National Intelligence James ) Clapper and the whole group that you see on television now – probably getting paid a lot of money by your networks – they knew about Russia ’s attempt to interfere in the election in September , and they totally buried it ",0
"And as I said , they buried it because they thought that Hillary Clinton was going to win ",1
It turned out it did n’t happen that way ,0
"“ By contrast , my administration has taken a very firm stance – it ’s a very firm stance – on a strong action ",1
We ’re going to take strong action to secure our election systems and the process ,1
” ,0
There are two key facts in this statement ,0
"First , the very people who have been loudest in attacking President Trump about his performance at the Helsinki summit are the people who failed to protect America from Russian meddling in 2016 ",1
The very intensity and nastiness of former CIA Director Brennan and former Director of National Intelligence Clapper is an attempt to distract attention from their failure to protect America ,1
It was their duty in 2016 – not candidate Trump ’s ,0
"Second , the Trump administration has been far tougher on Russia than President Obama ever dreamed of being ",0
The Trump administration is taking real actions designed to weaken Russia and force Putin to change his aggressive behavior ,1
The Trump administration has levied tough sanctions on Russia ,1
"Also , President Trump ’s public lecture about Germany not buying natural gas from Russia was aimed at cutting Putin off from hard currency worth tens of billions of dollars and further weakening the Russian economy ",0
"Furthermore , President Trump ’s efforts to get our European allies to increase their defense spending has a direct impact on Putin ",0
"The stronger NATO is , the less maneuvering room Russia has ",1
"Beyond pressuring our allies , consider these specific steps President Trump has taken against Russia : ",1
"Where President Obama refused to provide serious weapons to the Ukrainians to help them defend themselves ( his response was weakness on a pathetic scale ) , President Trump has approved the sale of offensive weapons to enable the Ukrainians to increase the cost of Russian aggression ",1
"When the Russians used chemical weapons in Great Britain , President Trump joined our allies and expelled 60 Russian intelligence officers from the United States ",1
"When the Russians retaliated , the Trump administration closed the Russian consulate in Seattle ",1
President Trump had previously shuttered the Russian consulate in San Francisco and smaller annexes in Washington and New York ,0
More than 100 Russian individuals and companies have been sanctioned for a variety of reasons ,0
"Despite the hysteria of the left , it is impossible to see the Trump administration as anything but firm in its dealing with Russia ",1
Nothing done in Helsinki made life easier for the Putin regime in its continued economic decay and diplomatic isolation due to the sanctions regime ,0
"Finally , a brief word about the strong language and vicious comments about the president ",1
We are in the early stages of a cultural civil war in which the left sees itself losing ,0
"This is what led me to write my new New York Times best - selling book , “ Trump ’s America : The Truth About Our Nation ’s Great Comeback ",1
” With each passing month the radical - extremist wing of the Democratic Party dominates the progressive wing more and more ,0
"With President Trump ’s nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court , it was clear that anyone Trump nominated was going to be attacked ",0
"In fact , the demonstrators protesting the nomination had signs for all four of the finalists and were instantly ready to oppose the president regardless of his choice ",0
"Similarly , Obama - era national security officials seem determined to use the harshest possible language to attack President Trump ",1
I think their strong words and hysteria are driven by their own guilt ,1
"Whatever the Russians did , they did while Brennan was director of the CIA , Clapper was director of national intelligence , and James Comey was head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation ",0
These former officials attack Trump ferociously to hide their own failure and their own guilt ,1
Just keep that in mind the next time you see one of them on TV ,0
"My prediction is that President Trump will remain tough on Russia , and the Helsinki press conference will be seen as the aberration it was ",0
Coroner Defies Court Order : Wo n't Release Las Vegas Shooter 's Autopsy Report ,0
Clark County Nevada Coroner John Fudenberg has determined to defy a court order from a district court judge to release the autopsy report of Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock ,0
"Though the order was issued on Tuesday , Fudenberg conferred with others and seems determined to not release the autopsy report until , as he said , it is """""""" finalized , """""""" The Las Vegas Review - Journal reported , which sued for the autopsy report ",0

"Wait , were the same guys in the autopsy room that were there when the doctors and coroners examined John F Kennedy ? ",1
"“ I do n’t believe this is consistent with what the court ordered , ” said Las Vegas attorney Maggie McLetchie , who represents the Las Vegas Review - Journal and The Associated Press in their November action demanding the release of the reports ",0
"“ They ( the coroner ’s office ) have delayed this for too long , and whatever stage the coroner ’s report on Paddock is in , it should be provided to the Review - Journal and Associated Press without further delay ",0
No more games ,1

” ,0
"“ The court correctly recognized the presumption of public access to records , even when a mass tragedy occurs , ” McLetchie added ",0
"“ ( The judge ) also rejected arguments by the coroner ’s office that there were any privacy interests with regards to the autopsy of Stephen Paddock , let alone any that outweighed the strong presumption of access to records in Nevada ",0

"“ The shooter ’s body was cremated Dec. 21 , """""""" said Review - Journal Editor - in - Chief Keith Moyer added ",0
""""""""" How can the autopsy report not be ‘ finalized’ when the body was cremated more than five weeks ago ? ",1
The law is squarely on the side of the public ’s right to open government ,0
” ,0
That 's exactly right ! ,1
Something is rotten in Denmark ! ,1
"On top of that , we have questions as to whether the body was even that of Stephen Paddock , given the fact that certain elements of the Paddock in the preliminary police report , which mentioned the autopsy , are apparently at odds with the Paddock of other documentation ",1
"McLetchie has been trying to obtain as much information for the public as possible , including video of Paddock at the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino ",0
"However , she has been told by Las Vegas Metro Police Department attornies that they ca n't release that information until they finalize their investigation into other suspects which may also produce charges in the case ",0
"“ The coroner ’s office has fought to keep autopsy reports confidential , ” the Review - Journal ",0
"The coroner was ordered on January 11 to pay nearly $ 32,000 in legal costs to the Review - Journal because it refused to release public records ",0
"While the preliminary report indicated the Paddock died of a gun shot wound to the head through the mouth , it 's all the details that are n't given that seem to be problematic for the coroner to release ",0
"By the way , the toxicology report was not mentioned in the preliminary report ",1

Spygate Coverup ? ,0
https://www.lewrockwell.com/lrc-blog/spygate-coverup/ ,0
Rep. Ron DeSantis ( R - FL ) accuses the Republican House leadership of dragging their heels in the Spygate investigation ,0
"This has been evident for months now , as there are many connections and obvious questions that have n’t been investigated ",0
The FBI files contain memos that need to be scoured too ,0
"The House leaders are Paul Ryan ( Speaker of the House ) , Kevin McCarthy ( Majority Leader ) , Steve Scalise ( Majority Whip ) and Cathy McMorris Rodgers ( House Republican Conference Chair ) ",0
There is a decided lack of aggressiveness of this investigation ,0
One source is Paul Ryan : Evidence : “ House Speaker Paul Ryan said Wednesday that Oversight Chairman Trey Gowdy was ‘ accurate’ when he argued the FBI has acted appropriately in its ongoing probe of potential Russian links to the Trump campaign ,0
” How could Ryan possibly know this ? ,1
Is n’t he prejudging the case without even finding out what actually happened ? ,1
"If Ryan is correct , an investigation will show it ; but the current evidence suggests he is wrong ",0
"By short - circuiting the investigation , Ryan is betraying the interest of the American people to learn what the FBI and CIA actually did against Trump ",1
"Another Republican who wants to stop investigating is former RNC Chair , Michael Steele : “ There is no Spygate because there are no spies in the campaign ",0
” The attitude of Steve Scalise is wishy - washy ,1
"He ’s open to a special prosecutor , but his responses come across as passive , lacking push , zeal and enthusiasm to delve deeply into Spygate ",1
"There is a kind of coverup at work here in which important Republicans do not want to bolster Trump by adding substance to Spygate , and they do not want to clean up the FBI by aggressively investigating Spygate further ",0
They do n’t want the rotten inner workings of the organization to be aired publicly ,1
They want to preserve the FBI ’s reputation ,1
They do n’t care to see Trump vindicated ,1
The contrast with the Watergate investigation and hearings is startling ,1

Who ‘ Won’ the Trump - Kim Summit ? ,0
Last week ’s Economist Magazine won the day with the best - ever headline about the Trump - Kim Jong - un summit : ` Kim Jong Won!’ ,1
That said it all ,0
"Just out of hospital , I was in no shape to compete with the great Economist or its very witty headline writers ",0
But after watching a week of post Singapore summit between Great White Father Trump and delinquent Kim Jong - un I must totally agree with the Economist ,1
What was billed as a second - coming extravaganza between the two leaders – who have been trading insults of ‘ little rocket man’ and ‘ dotard’ ( someone who is senile ) turned out to be a very expensive photo op for both publicity seekers that made much noise but produced very little – at least so far ,1
It seemed as if two schoolyard bullies had been forced by the principal to shake hands ,1
"Beyond gestures , North Korea ’s leader certainly came out ahead ",0
"His objective – and those of his family predecessors for the past 60 years – was to normalize relations with the US , start trade , and end US efforts to overthrow the Marxist government in Pyongyang ",0
"American Raj : Liberati ... Eric Margolis Best Price : $ 5.99 Buy New $ 45.86 ( as of 09:30 EDT - Details ) Trump ’s objectives , at least initially , were to crush North Korea and the threats it could pose to the United States and its regional allies Japan and South Korea ",1
"Trump sought to set up Kim as a bogeyman , and himself as America ’s savior ",1
"Trump knew perfectly well that he could not destroy all of North Korea ’s deeply buried nuclear - armed missiles , and , in spite of his huffing and puffing , had no stomach for an invasion of North Korea that could cost the US an estimated 250,000 casualties ",1
So Trump ’s solution was more show - biz ,1
"A much ballyhooed flight to Singapore , backslapping a delighted Kim , and a love - fest between the two chunky leaders was sold to Americans as the dawn of peace ",1
America ’s media was quick to retail the story and burnish Trump ’s credentials among the seriously credulous ,1
No more hiding under your school desks or in dank basements ,0
"As Trump grandly proclaimed , Americans no longer have to fear North Korea and can sleep peacefully at night ! ",1
Why ? ,1
Korea still has all of its medium and long - ranged missiles and an estimated 40 or more nuclear warheads ,0
The North is developing submarines that can launch nuclear - armed missiles from underwater off America ’s coasts ,0
"For Kim , these weapons are purely defensive , designed to prevent a US attack on his nation ",0
But he is now a full - fledged member of the nuclear club ,0
"Equally important , North Korea still has an estimated 14,000 170 mm guns and hundreds of 300 mm long - ranged rocket launchers emplaced in caves just north of the Demilitarized Zone between the two Koreas ",0
"They threaten almost all of South Korea ’s capital Seoul north of the Han River and some US military bases and key airfields , notably Osan ",0
This is a very real threat – one that is largely immune to attack from the air ,1
I have seen these emplacements from the northern edge of the DMZ ,0
Kim ’s big guns hold Seoul ’s millions of inhabitants hostage ,0
War at the Top of the ... Eric Margolis Best Price : $ 2.60 Buy New $ 24.57 ( as of 09:00 EDT - Details ) ,0
There is no mention of this artillery threat in the final communiqué issued by Trump and Kim in Singapore ,0
"But it was agreed to temporarily stop the highly provocative US / South Korean war games simulating an invasion of the North , a key demand by Kim ",1
This column has been calling for their end for a decade ,0
North Korea will seemingly halt its missile tests ,0
This is not the ‘ denuclearization’ of North Korea that has been bandied about ,0
There may be a few gestures of disarmament but Kim must know that his nukes are his means of survival ,0
"In case Kim did n’t remember the dire fate of Iraq , Libya , and Syria , Trump ’s new national security advisor John Bolton , a fanatic ’s fanatic , cheerfully recalled the doom of Libya ’s murdered Col ",1
Khadaffi ,0
The Singapore summit was also a huge humiliation for America ’s allies Japan and South Korea ,1
"In Asia , preserving ‘ face’ is essential ",0
"Trump completely ignored America ’s two old allies after his meeting with Kim – who routinely blasts Japan and South Korea as ‘ America ’s stooges.’ Instead , Trump sent his beginner Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to explain what happened in Singapore , inflicting a deep loss of face on Tokyo and Seoul ",1
This was a terrible insult and could spark decisions by at least Japan to proceed ahead with its covert nuclear program ,1
Japan can deploy nuclear weapons in 3 - 6 months ; South Korea is not far behind ,0
The United States and North Korea are now on a more civilized level of behavior ,0
But nothing basic has been resolved ,0
"Maybe Trump has some more concessions up his sleeve , like cutting the number of US troops in the South ",0
But Korea is now on the back burner as Trump wages trade wars around the globe ,0

Trump 's North Korean gamble ends with ' special bond ' with Kim ,0
Nearly five hours of unprecedented and surreal talks between US President Donald Trump and North Korea 's Kim Jong Un culminated on Tuesday with fulsome declarations of a new friendship but just vague pledges of nuclear disarmament ,1
"For Trump , that amounted to a triumphant outcome in his extraordinary gamble with the rogue kingdom 's despotic leader ",1
"But there were scant details on what new commitments had been secured from Kim , even as Trump announced he would end the regular military exercises the US conducts with South Korea ",0
"Whether nuclear disarmament is indeed the final outcome of Tuesday 's summit wo n't be known for years , if not decades ",0

Saying the shahada makes you a Muslim ,1
The shahada is what is on the black flag of jihad ,1
No non - Muslim student should be forced to write or say the shahada without the qualifier “ Muslims believe that … ” This is because it is a statement of faith ,0

"Rich Penkoski , the father of a Mountain Ridge student , contacted me and explained the situation further ",0
He sent me the packets the school gave out for the Jewish and the Christian lessons and commented : ,0
"Notice no bible verses , no reciting the 10 commandments or the Lord ’s prayer ",0
No practicing writing in Hebrew ( not even the 10 commandments ) as compared to the Islamic packet ,0
"There are no statements of faith , nothing asking the students to write it or practice in any of the Jewish or Christian rituals ",0
Furthermore the principal of Mountain Ridge Middle School Dr. ,0
Branch has used my words against me by saying the teacher did tell the students about the Lord ’s prayer ( my daughter as well as 1 other said this is false)[. ] ,0
He is using my arguments I made to him yesterday to protect the teacher ,0
The teacher today told the students the assignment was optional ,0
My daughter as well as other students were under the impression all the packet assignments were mandatory ( the Jewish one and the Christian ones were mandatory ) ,0
I wrote to Dr. ,0
Branch to share with him the resource that Miss Hinson used and point out that the material she gave the students did not include all the faith aspects for Christianity ,0
The students received 2 pages for Christianity from this resource while all the Islamic sections were left intact ,0
Here ’s the link for you to review ,0
You will notice all the faith elements were left out for Judaism and Christianity while the Islamic section was left the way it ’s presented ,0
https://www.gvsd.org/cms/lib/PA01001045/Centricity/Domain/610/World%20Religions.pdf So she decided to use the extra resources for Islam and the school is saying that ’s not indoctrination or proselytizing ? ,0
The faith aspects and the same considerations were not given to the others as they were for Islam ,0
This actually further proves my point that Islam was afforded special privilege over the others ,0
The school is backtracking and being deceptive to try and weasel out of this ,0
The teacher today clarified things for the students but that still does not excuse the fact that they are teaching the Islamic faith and asking the kids to participate in Sharia ,0
Look at the Islamic packet again ,0
They are asking the kids to write the beginning of Surahs ,0
The teacher still has not corrected the error that calligraphy was started by the arabs ,0
They are doubling down and only after being called on it are they trying to backtrack ,0
Rich Penkoski is hardly the first to protest this egregious submission to the most vicious and brutal ideology on the face of the Earth ,1
"In Volusia County , Florida , hundreds protested Islamic lessons in their “ World History ” text , a Common Core - approved high school history textbook ",0
"With an entire chapter dedicated to the virtues of Islam and not a single chapter for Christianity , the textbook had Floridians in a frenzy ",1
And who is the biggest pusher of Common Core besides leftist progressives ? ,0
"The Islamic Society of North America , a Muslim Brotherhood front group , along with the Hamas - tied Council on American - Islamic Relations ( CAIR ) ",0
"In Florida , CAIR is on the offensive ( more here ) ",0
We have seen the increasing Islamization of the public - school curriculum ,1
History lessons in Islam are dawah – proselytizing for Islam ,0
Large public - school publishers have been bought by the Saudis ,0
"In West Virginia , it gets even worse ",0
"Rich Penkoski has alerted me to the latest development in the forced Islamization of his children ’s school curriculum : after the Daily Caller and Geller Report exposed what was happening , Mountain Ridge administrators and teachers began messaging parents who were sharing the story , asking them to remove their posts ",1
What do they have to hide ? ,0
"Apparently , a great deal ",0
"Worse still , Penkoski is now being threatened by students who attend the school with his daughter ",1
( And who is behind them ? ,0
Unidentified “ adult friends ,0
” ) ,0
He sent this message to me : ,0
A student in the school threatened to get her adult friends to come to my home and kill me by stabbing me in the chest and ripping my organs out ,1
They told my daughter “ we are gon na get some people and kill your dad ,1
"” This student , who is known to me but whom I can not name because she is a minor , has given students our address and is encouraging them to come to my home over this whole thing ",0
Another student told my daughter that she and the first student and her adult friends are going to kill me and carve a satanic star in my chest and rip out my organs ,1
They then threatened to hang my 3-year - old and 1-year - old and kidnap my 14-year - old ,1
All this in school today because of the articles ,0
This is not a joke and needs to be investigated ,0
"I have contacted the school ’s principal , Dr. ",0
"Branch , and I trust that he will take this matter seriously and deal with it appropriately ",0
Is the principal acting on this ? ,1
And do the police have any interest in this ? ,1
Or would that be “ islamofauxbic ” ? ,1

Gun Control Is Now Truly Impossible ,1
Gun control is the dream of every wannabe statist dictator and naive do - gooder alike ,1
"The latter think that removing guns will suddenly force humanity to stop all animosity toward one another , hold hands , and sing Kumbaya ",1
The former recognizes that an armed populace is a threat to any tyrant and pushes for gun control out of self - preservation ,1
"However , a new ruling in a court case over 3-D printer files of guns has now made gun control virtually impossible ",1
"FIVE YEARS AGO , 25-year - old radical libertarian Cody Wilson stood on a remote central Texas gun range and pulled the trigger on the world ’s first fully 3-D - printed gun ",0

"In the days after that first test - firing , his gun was downloaded more than 100,000 times ",0
"Wilson made the decision to go all in on the project , dropping out of law school at the University of Texas , as if to confirm his belief that technology supersedes law ",0
The law caught up ,0
"Less than a week later , Wilson received a letter from the US State Department demanding that he take down his printable - gun blueprints or face prosecution for violating federal export controls ",1
"Under an obscure set of US regulations known as the International Trade in Arms Regulations ( ITAR ) , Wilson was accused of exporting weapons without a license , just as if he ’d shipped his plastic gun to Mexico rather than put a digital version of it on the internet ",1
"He took Defcad.com offline , but his lawyer warned him that he still potentially faced millions of dollars in fines and years in prison simply for having made the file available to overseas downloaders for a few days ",0

"Two months ago , the Department of Justice quietly offered Wilson a settlement to end a lawsuit he and a group of co - plaintiffs have pursued since 2015 against the United States government ",0
"Wilson and his team of lawyers focused their legal argument on a free speech claim : They pointed out that by forbidding Wilson from posting his 3-D - printable data , the State Department was not only violating his right to bear arms but his right to freely share information ",0
"By blurring the line between a gun and a digital file , Wilson had also successfully blurred the lines between the Second Amendment and the First ",0

"“ If code is speech , the constitutional contradictions are evident , ” Wilson explained to WIRED when he first launched the lawsuit in 2015 ",0
“ So what if this code is a gun ? ” ,1
"The Department of Justice ’s surprising settlement , confirmed in court documents earlier this month , essentially surrenders to that argument ",0
"It promises to change the export control rules surrounding any firearm below .50 caliber — with a few exceptions like fully automatic weapons and rare gun designs that use caseless ammunition — and move their regulation to the Commerce Department , which wo n’t try to police technical data about the guns posted on the public internet ",0
"In the meantime , it gives Wilson a unique license to publish data about those weapons anywhere he chooses ",0
"“ I consider it a truly grand thing , ” Wilson says ",0
"“ It will be an irrevocable part of political life that guns are downloadable , and we helped to do that ",1

Kavanaugh immediately responded to Grassley ,0
"For 36 hours , there was silence from the Ford camp ",0
"Then , their demands began ",0
"First , it was reported that Ford would answer questions , but only at a closed hearing and only after an FBI investigation had been completed ",0
"Republicans felt that the request for a closed hearing was reasonable , but the demand for a new FBI investigation was not ",0
The FBI investigates federal crimes and/or national security issues ,0
"When the FBI received Dianne Feinstein ’s letter last week , they forwarded it to the White House to place in Kavanaugh ’s background check file ",0

"SPECIAL REPORT : Papal Cover - up Alleged , Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case ",0
"Hey , remember five minutes ago when Pope Francis shouted at a reporter in Chile that there was “ no evidence ” supporting complaints against his good friend Bishop Juan Barros ? ",1
"And , just for good measure he accused the people accusing him – victims of sexual abuse by Barros’ mentor , the convicted sex - predator Karadima – of committing “ calumny ” ? ",1
[ 1 ] And remember when Cardinal O’Malley told the pope off in public over the “ pain ” these accusations had caused the victims of sexual abuse ? ,1
"And then remember how the pope had apologised - except - not - really because the accusations are , after all , still lies , and that there ’s still “ no evidence ” against Barros … ? ",1
"The press , secular as well as Catholic , is full this week of the story that the pope did indeed see evidence of Barros’ complicity in Karadima ’s sexual abuse – not only that Barros had helped to cover it up but that he had been present and a direct witness at the time and therefore a passive participant ",0
"Nicole Winfield and the Associated Press dropped the bomb that the information came directly from the victims , whom Francis had dismissed and refused to meet with on his trip , and delivered through his own Commission on sexual abuse : ",1
"Pope Francis received a victim ’s letter in 2015 that graphically detailed how a priest sexually abused him and how other Chilean clergy ignored it , contradicting the pope ’s recent insistence that no victims had come forward to denounce the cover - up , the letter ’s author and members of Francis’ own sex- abuse commission have told The Associated Press ",0
"The fact that Francis received the eight - page letter , obtained by the AP , challenges his insistence that he has “ zero tolerance ” for sex abuse and cover - ups ",0
"It also calls into question his stated empathy with abuse survivors , compounding the most serious crisis of his five - year papacy ",1
Now it appears that Francis had also overruled a 2015 warning from the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith that Barros should not be made a bishop ,0
"The Italian Catholic daily La Nuova Bussola Quotidiana reports that not only did the pope see a letter from victims , but that the CDF , under Muller , “ had already conducted an preliminary investigation into Barros and the other bishops close to Karadima which had led to the decision to relieve them of their duties ",0
” ,0
"“ But with a letter signed by the Pope in January 2015 and sent to the Chilean bishops , the request for exemption is blocked and shortly thereafter Barros is promoted to … Osorno ",0
” ,0
"The article points out that while Karadima was convicted by a Vatican tribunal on the testimony of the victims , it is the same testimony of the same victim - witnesses that Francis now dismisses in the accusations against Barros ",0
"The accusations that stood against Karadima come from the same sources as those against Barros , who the victims said was in the room watching at the time ",0
"While the specifics are still not known , readers may be reminded by this of a peculiar incident about a year later in which Pope Francis summarily ordered the dismissal of three priests of the CDF , whose remit was investigations of clerics accused of sexual abuse ",0
"The website One Peter Five reports , via Marco Tosatti , that the pope ordered their removal without offering any explanation to then - cardinal prefect Gerhard Muller ",0
"When , after several attempts and three months later[2 ] , Muller was able to get an audience with the pope to ask the reason , he received the response , “ I am the pope , I do not need to give reasons for any of my decisions ",1
I have decided that they have to leave and they have to leave ,1
” ,1
"Marco Tosatti reports the CDF incident , but it follows an odd story of a meeting of curial officials to discuss certain bishop appointments ",0
"Without naming names , ( or , frustratingly , giving dates[3 ] ) Tosatti relates : ",0
"“ It was some time ago to make a bishop , not in Italy ",0
The nuncio has prepared the triad [ the “ terna ” or list of three candidates ] ,0
"A cardinal , head of the dicastery , perhaps the same holder of the Congregation for Bishops , during the ordinary assembly took the floor , saying : ‘ The first candidate indicated is excellent , the second is good ",0
"But I would like to warn of the third , whom I know well , since he was a seminarian , and who presents problems both on the level of doctrine and morality ",0
He responds little to the necessary criteria ,0
"But the third was a friend of someone and another cardinal , of the circle currently in power , has flung himself at his colleague , accusing him of impropriety.’ The meeting ended without further decisions ",0
” ,0
"Whatever the details of these strange incidents , what is clear in Chile is that no amount of eyewitness testimony was going to make the slightest difference ",0
Bergoglio wanted Barros as a bishop and that was that ,0
"Even while “ apologising ” the pope had doubled down when questioned about it by journalists , saying , “ You , in all good will , tell me that there are victims , but I have n’t seen any , because they have n’t come forward ",0
” ,0
"“ In the case of Barros it ’s been observed , it ’s been studied ; there ’s no evidence ",0
The best thing to do if someone believes it ’s the case is to come forward quickly with evidence ,0
” ,0
"The AP report , however , says exactly the opposite ; that members of his own ( now defunct[4 ] ) abuse Commission had approached Cardinal O’Malley , the pope ’s “ top abuse advisor , ” with the letter to deliver to the pope ",0
"Marie Collins , the Irish abuse survivor and Commission member who resigned , citing the Vatican ’s refusal to take meaningful action , told AP , “ When we gave him [ O’Malley ] the letter for the pope , he assured us he would give it to the pope and speak of the concerns ",0
"And at a later date , he assured us that that had been done ",0
"” Juan Carlos Cruz , the Karadima victim whose membership on the Commission the Vatican had blocked , told AP , “ Cardinal O’Malley called me after the pope ’s visit here in Philadelphia and he told me , among other things , that he had given the letter to the pope – in his hands ",1
” ,0
"On the face of it , there are only a few logical possibilities here ",0
"In fact , unless Cardinal O’Malley – who has , as of this writing , remained silent – comes forward and says that he did n’t hand the letter over pope , there is really only one ; that the pope lied ",0
"And this is what is now being said quite openly by a vast array of voices , secular and Catholic , left and right ",0
"As Winfield writes , ",0
"“ The revelation could be costly for Francis , whose track record on the abuse crisis was already shaky after a botched Italian abuse case he intervened in became public[5 ] ",0
"More recently , he let the abuse commission lapse at the end of last year ",0
"Vatican analysts now openly question whether he ‘ gets it,’ and some of his own advisers privately acknowledge that maybe he does n’t ",0
” ,0
"“ No evidence … ” Lie big , lie often , and when caught , keep lying ",1
"One of the many things these secular reporters seem not to be paying attention to is that “ no evidence ” is in fact a well - rehearsed , stock response for Bergoglio ",1
He said almost exactly the same in 2013 when confronted about another predatory homosexual he was sheltering ,1
The hoopla surrounding the “ Who am I to judge ” comment tends to obscure the context of the comment ,1
It was made in response to a question by a journalist about Monsignore Battista Ricca – a prelate whose promiscuous homosexuality is so well known it was covered by the Telegraph as early as July 2013 ,0
"Ilze Scamparini asked the pope about Ricca , saying , “ What you intend to do about this ? ",0
How are you confronting this issue and how does Your Holiness intend to confront the whole question of the gay lobby ? ” ,0
What reply did Bergoglio give ? ,0
His standard one : “ No evidence ,1
” ,1
"About Monsignor Ricca : I did what canon law calls for , that is a preliminary investigation ",0
"And from this investigation , there was nothing of what had been alleged ",0
We did not find anything of that ,0
This is the response ,0
” ,0
"He added , “ In this case , I conducted the preliminary investigation and we did n’t find anything ",0
” ,0
"But Ricca ’s activities , for which the pope claimed there was no evidence , were notorious ",0
"They include being caught in flagrante in an elevator with a teenaged male prostitute , and his sexual relationship with a captain in the Swiss army ",0
So flagrant was Ricca ’s behaviour that it took intervention by Uruguay ’s nuncio to have him removed ,1
"It was reported in 1999 and 2000 by L’Espresso , who said the information was confirmed by “ numerous bishops , priests , religious and laity ” in Uruguay[6 ] ",0
"In fact , the evidence shows that Ricca is completely in line with Bergoglio ’s normal procedures ",0
"As “ Marcantonio Colonna ” wrote in the Dictator Pope , “ In fact his patronage of Monsignor Ricca fits the pattern which was well established when he was Archbishop of Buenos Aires , whereby he surrounds himself with morally weak people so as to have them under his thumb ",1
” ,0
"It was at this early “ no evidence ” comment on the plane home from Rio that some of those paying attention started to understand that Bergoglio ’s policy is in line with that of certain leaders of the past who recommended that if a politician was going to lie , he should lie big and lie brazenly ",1
"And in case anyone was wondering what will happen next , the same advice said to keep on lying after you ’re caught ",0
"The pattern of silence and , when pressed , flat - out denial has been Bergoglio ’s policy since long before he came on the international scene ",0
"He has a long record in Argentina of shaving close to scandals and vociferously denying involvement , and relying heavily on the broad good will of Catholics towards bishops to pull it off ",0
Perhaps his biggest error with Barros was failing to understand just how little of that capital of trust there is left in the Catholic world as a whole ,0
"Indeed , on the subject of priests sexually abusing young people , it could only be measured in the negative numbers ",0
“ Argentine Victims Who Tried to Meet with Pope Francis … ” ,0
"Though the website Bishop Accountability is blatantly anti - clerical , their data is unassailable since most of it comes from information that is already public ",0
On their Argentina page is a long list of accusations that Bergoglio / Francis simply is n’t interested in hearing from victims ,0
"“ In Pope Francis ’s 21 years as bishop and archbishop of Buenos Aires , the Wall Street Journal reports , including the years when he headed the Argentine bishops’ conference , he declined to meet with victims of sexual abuse ",0
” ,0
"“ All of them tried to contact the cardinal archbishop in 2002 or later , ” the same period when Pope Benedict and other bishops were striving to meet with victims and demonstrate an interest in the problem ",0
"The site says that “ in addition to Bergoglio ’s failure to respond to victims , the public record contains no evidence that he released any information about abusers ",0
” ,0
"In fact , he went so far as to flatly deny there had been any instances of abuse in his archdiocese ",0
"Weeks after his election to the papacy , he was quoted by his close friend , Rabbi Abraham Skorka , “ In my diocese it never happened to me , but a bishop called me once by phone to ask me what to do in a situation like this ",0
” Francis added that he agreed with the “ zero tolerance ” attitude of the Irish episcopate and admired Pope Benedict ’s reforms – most of which he was later to quietly reverse ,0
"It was at exactly this time , however , that victims from Argentina were attempting to get the new pope ’s attention ",0
"One , known to the press only as “ Gabriel , ” wanted to talk to Francis about the sexual abuse he suffered at the hands of Julio César Grassi , accused of molesting at least five boys , “ who has been avoiding the sentences of the justice of Morón and the Court of Cassation ",0
"So far , judges and prosecutors at all instances found him guilty ",0
” ,0
"In case anyone thinks the Grassi - Gabriel case was not serious enough for the pope ’s attention , Bishop Accountability summarises , “ A year after Gabriel had filed criminal charges [ 2003 ] but before the start of Grassi ’s trial , three men ransacked the survivor ’s apartment and beat him ",0
” These men threatened to kill him if he did not retract his testimony and quit the case ,0
"Ten years [ after Gabriel filed criminal charges ] , in May 2013 , with Grassi still free despite his conviction in 2009 , “ Gabriel and his attorney , Juan Pablo Gallego , brought a two - page letter addressed to Pope Francis to the office of the papal nuncio in Buenos Aires ",0
An employee refused to accept the letter after learning of its topic and threatened to call security if Gabriel and Gallego did not leave the premises ,0
” ,0
The group surmises that it was Bergoglio ’s direct intervention with judges in the case that prevented a conviction against Grassi for so long and delayed his sentencing through multiple appeals ,0
"In 2006 , then - Archbishop Bergoglio complained of a “ media campaign ” and claimed that the Grassi case was “ different ” from other accusations ",0
During his criminal trial Grassi said Bergoglio “ never let go ” of his hand ,0
"In 2009 , Grassi was convicted of two counts of aggravated sexual assault and corruption in the case of “ Gabriel , ” who was aged 13 at the time of the abuse , but the appeals dragged on until he was finally sent to prison in September 2013 ",0
"Several more similar cases , all of whom were rebuffed in their attempts to meet with Bergoglio , are detailed here , for the strong - of - stomach ",1
A virtuoso performance - liar ,1
"Looking back and carefully examining his record , Jorge Bergoglio ’s mastery of using the weaknesses of morally compromised men is becoming evident ",1
It is arguable that even the members of the so - called “ San Gallen Mafia ” who apparently conspired to put him on Peter ’s throne were used by him ,0
But he is also a master of judging an audience and telling them what they expect to hear ; a key skill for all grifters and confidence tricksters ,0
"Looking carefully at the infamous “ Who am I to judge ” comment , this was clear early on ",0
"The first part of that interview is a blatant and enormous lie , and it was from there that the pope moved on to his apology for homosexuality in general ",1
"Recall that this was the very first airplane interview , on the trip back to Rome from World Youth Day in Rio , a matter of weeks after his election ",0
"At the time , the papal apologists sprang instantly into action and we heard all about how the pope was talking strictly within the boundaries of Catholic doctrine ",1
"But perhaps in hindsight , we are ready to examine the full implications of his little speech , one that was clearly well - rehearsed ",0
"( Do n’t forget , no question is asked in a papal interview without being thoroughly vetted ahead of time ",1
Journalists must submit their questions well in advance ,0
) ,0
"This was the pope laying out his policy regarding homosexuality , a policy for which he was duly rewarded by being lauded on the cover of the homosexualist lobby ’s US trade magazine ",1
Read his full answer carefully : ,0
"I see that many times in the Church , over and above this case , but including this case , people search for “ sins from youth ” , for example , and then publish them ",0
"They are not crimes , right ? ",0
Crimes are something different : the abuse of minors is a crime ,0
"No , sins ",0
"But if a person , whether it be a lay person , a priest or a religious sister , commits a sin and then converts , the Lord forgives , and when the Lord forgives , the Lord forgets and this is very important for our lives ",0
"When we confess our sins and we truly say , “ I have sinned in this ” , the Lord forgets , and so we have no right not to forget , because otherwise we would run the risk of the Lord not forgetting our sins ",0
That is a danger ,1
This is important : a theology of sin ,0
Many times I think of Saint Peter ,0
"He committed one of the worst sins , that is he denied Christ , and even with this sin they made him Pope ",0
We have to think a great deal about that ,0
"But , returning to your question more concretely ",0
"In this case , I conducted the preliminary investigation and we did n’t find anything ",0
This is the first question ,0
"Then , you spoke about the gay lobby ",0
So much is written about the gay lobby ,0
I still have n’t found anyone with an identity card in the Vatican with “ gay ” on it ,0
They say there are some there ,0
"I believe that when you are dealing with such a person , you must distinguish between the fact of a person being gay and the fact of someone forming a lobby , because not all lobbies are good ",0
This one is not good ,0
"If someone is gay and is searching for the Lord and has good will , then who am I to judge him ? ",1
"The Catechism of the Catholic Church explains this in a beautiful way , saying ... wait a moment , how does it say it ... it says : “ no one should marginalize these people for this , they must be integrated into society ” ",0
"The problem is not having this tendency , no , we must be brothers and sisters to one another , and there is this one and there is that one ",0
"The problem is in making a lobby of this tendency : a lobby of misers , a lobby of politicians , a lobby of masons , so many lobbies ",1
"For me , this is the greater problem ",0
Thank you so much for asking this question ,0
Many thanks ,0
One of the pope ’s favourite rhetorical techniques is a combination of Begging the Question and conspiracy ,0
"He starts by assuming , without any effort at defence or explanation , a point that concedes the whole issue ",0
This was the first time a pope had ever used the political term “ gay ” ,0
"Not “ homosexual , ” not “ same - sex attracted , ” but “ gay , ” meaning that he started by adopting the entirety of the homosexualist movement ’s linguistic manipulations ",0
"Language counts in politics , and a pope using that term means he is by implication starting the discussion – and his pontificate – by aligning himself with the basic tenets of a movement that is violently opposed to Catholic moral teaching , and in direct opposition to his immediate , and still living , predecessor ",1
"In this case too , he was addressing a plane load of journalists who were either secular themselves , or for the most part are the kind of Catholic who believes it is fine to “ disagree ” with Catholic teaching on sexuality ",0
There are very few “ conservative ” Catholics in the Vatican journalist pool ,0
"This means that his use of this language was a conspiratorial wink and nod to his immediate audience , a sly message to say , “ People talk all the time about a gay lobby , but you and I both know this is mostly nonsense , propaganda from those people … those conservatives … We cool and hip people do n’t hate gays , do we ? ” ",1
"This astonishing departure follows an implied but very clear assertion that Ricca has repented and given up his activity , an assertion that has absolutely no evidence to back it up ",0
"We are simply asked to take the pope ’s word for it , but given that it follows his astoundingly brazen lie that there was no evidence for Ricca ’s homosexual activity in the first place , we can take the assurance for what it seems to be worth ",1
"Next , after another little inside nudge - nudge - wink - wink joke about the “ gay lobby ” – implying ( but of course never outright saying ) that the whole thing is hysterical nonsense – we hear a direct contradiction to Catholic teaching from no less a source than his predecessor , Pope Benedict Ratzinger ",1
“ The problem is not having this tendency ,0
"” Well , actually , your holiness , yes it is , particularly in the case of priests ",0
The “ tendency ” is called in the same catechism you quote “ intrinsically disordered ” and Ratzinger was very clear that this “ tendency ” is a sign of a serious emotional dysfunction that “ must ” preclude a man from being ordained ,1
Squandering the capital of trust ,1
"A few months ago in a piece for the Remnant , I talked about why the Church ( and nearly all human societies ) regard lying as a sin : ",0
A mistake many make about lying is to understand it only in terms of morality ,0
But Thomas makes the point that it is first a matter of metaphysics ,0
Lying is an act at variance in its essence with the nature of reality ,0
"Thomistic theology teaches that it is by lying that we become most like the devil , and most unlike God , because we are trying to change the nature of reality to suit our own purposes ",0
"Habitual lying in effect changes you into a different kind of being , one that is by nature an opponent of Truth , ordered against Truth ",0
"This of course means that a person whose “ orientation , ” as we might say , is towards falsehood , even when he is at any given moment saying something true , is still servicing his lies ",0
He tells the truth only to continue to control and manipulate reality ,0
"It was not by violence , but by lying and manipulation , by issuing half - truths and pretending to be the kind of man he was not , that Shakespeare ’s character Iago earned the title of most evil character in English literature ",0
"Human beings are naturally ordered towards the truth , and we have to work at assuming a lie ",0
"This is why confidence tricksters can be successful , why lying works for getting what you want ; people do n’t see it coming ",0
"The first natural assumption is trust , at least at the basic level of expecting truth most of the time ",0
We therefore instinctively see lying as a betrayal of trust ,0
"Considering how much trust the Catholic faithful had in the papacy until about 1965 , how much un - earned trust Francis started with just by being elected , this pontificate should be remembered as one of the great confidence scams in history ",1
Believing Catholics have watched aghast as this pope has habitually trampled on every aspect of Catholic teaching ,1
"Sandro Magister recently published a piece on his website that listed in dizzying detail the many times , in only the last few months , that pope Francis has falsified with obvious intention , the words of Christ in Scripture and the teaching of the Church ",1
"Of course this would be of little interest to secular journalists , who have paid no mind to his habit of rewriting Catholicism , but the sex abuse crisis is something secular journalists are very interested in , a fact Bergoglio seems not to have understood ",1
"It is now irrefutable that Pope Bergoglio is a habitual liar – that in fact truth , like reality , seems to mean nothing to him except as a tool ",1
"Sociologists talk about the concept of the “ high trust society , ” one in which citizens believe what they are told by the elites and trust them to govern and protect them adequately ",0
"They warn that the general loss of trust in institutions leads to a general state of chaos , in which laws on the books matter little as citizens turn to their last resort of protecting themselves and their own families ",1
This is the way societies disintegrate ,0
"It has been said many times that the sex abuse crisis has created a massive loss of trust in prelates among the Catholic faithful , and this is true ",0
"With a professional confidence trickster on the papal throne , blatantly using lies and manipulation to maintain power and ram through an agenda at radical variance with Catholic doctrine , how long before that predictable disintegration occurs ? ",1
Are we seeing it already ? ,0
Are we seeing it in the declarations of this or that episcopate on Amoris Laetitia and Communion for divorced and civilly remarried Catholics ? ,0
With Cardinal Marx and others promoting “ blessings ” for “ same - sex unions ” are we going to be seeing an escalation of it ? ,0
"I have seen a veritable chorus of Catholics on social media declaring that if Paul VI is canonised , their loss of faith in the Church as an institution will be complete ",1
I am told from contacts inside the Vatican that after the trip to Chile Bergoglio ’s support has completely dried up ,0
"He has no more resources of trust even among the people he has chosen to surround himself with and after the reports of Cardinal Sandri going toe - to - toe with him in a shouting match , it seems that perhaps even his legendary vicious temper tantrums are failing to have the desired effect of terrorising his subordinates into submission ",1
"Marie Collins , by no stretch even a “ conservative ” Catholic , echoed this concern , saying the Barros affair has “ definitely undermined credibility , trust , and hope ” in Francis ",0
"“ All I can say is that people who had a lot of hope in this particular pope , and I am talking about just ordinary Catholics that I know in my own parish , would find it very difficult now … and can not understand and can not believe that this particular pope has said the things he has said in the last few weeks , ” she told the National Catholic Reporter ",0
"It may seem like a moment to enjoy , seeing the apparently unbreachable shell of papal teflon finally cracking , but in reality this situation is potentially very harmful for souls in the long run ",1
"There is a multitude of problems this pontificate has created or made worse that we will be dealing with for a long time after Bergoglio is gone , but perhaps one of the bigger ones will be the destruction of trust ",0
"Already fractured since the collapse of all Catholic institutions after Vatican II and the horrors of the sex abuse crisis , how much will there be to repair of the once - steadfast trust Catholics instinctively had in the Church after this ? ",1
Notes : ,0
[ 1 ] “ Not one victim has come forward in Chile ; show me the proof ,0
This is slander and calumny ,1
Is that clear ? ” ,0
"[ 2 ] The book “ The Dictator Pope ” relates that regular meetings between the pope and dicastery heads have been abolished and even high - ranking curia prefects are often unable to see the pope , whose appointments are now completely controlled by the Secretariat of State ",0
"It is certainly clear that no one sees the pope unless Cardinal Parolin approves , which may be the reason Cardinal Zen , in his efforts to warn Francis of the dangers of a Vatican deal with the communist Chinese government had to wait in the rain at a Wednesday general audience ",0
[ 3 ] This is common in Italian journalism that has somewhat different standards from that of the Anglo world … and drives the rest of us spare ,0
"Italians care about getting a general picture of what ’s going on , where Anglo - Saxons are considered weirdly obsessed with trivial details ",0
"[ 4 ] Though she never blamed the pope , Marie Collins complained that Vatican officialdom had simply not implemented the Commission ’s recommendations ",0
The time limit of the Commission ’s members was allowed to lapse without renewal and though it was not dissolved formally the Commission has ceased to function with no word of any plan to revive it ,0
"[ 5 ] Probably a reference to the Inzoli case in which Francis overturned a previous sentence of a Vatican tribunal after the priest – now laicised – approached some of the pope ’s close advisors for help , including Cardinal Coccopalmerio ",0
[ 6 ] Not that anyone in Rome was trying very hard ,1
"Sandro Magister reported after the “ Who am I to judge ” comment , “ Before the appointment , Francis had been shown , as is customary , the personal file on Ricca , in which he had not found anything unseemly ",0
"He had also heard from various personalities of the curia , and none of them had raised objections ",0

Student says anti - Semitism still an issue in McGill student government ,0
"The McGill student at the centre of anti - Semitic allegations says he ’s certain the climate within student government will improve , after a report into the incident was made public this week ",0
Noah Lew and two other students were voted off the Students’ Society of McGill University last October after they were identified as having pro - Israel viewpoints ,0
They were since reinstated ,0
A report made public this week by Spencer Boudreau concluded he could not determine if students who organized against the three board members had anti - Semitic intentions ,0
"Boudreau , a retired professor of education and former ombudsperson for students , however , said he understood why the students felt they were targeted because they are Jewish ",0
"After criticism from several Jewish groups both on and off campus , Boudreau issued a clarification to the report , saying he could not determine if the vote was motivated by anti - Semitism , but he acknowledged there were “ in fact anti - Semitic effects felt by members of the Jewish community ",0
” ,0
"Speaking to the Montreal Gazette on Friday , Lew , the SSMU ’s vice - president of finance for the Arts , said he was initially upset with the report , but felt vindicated by Boudreau ’s clarification ",0
"“ I thought this acknowledgement was very important and I really did appreciate that he clarified the matter , ” he said ",0
"Jewish groups had criticized Boudreau ’s report , saying it ignored anti - Semitic language used on Facebook by a group called Democratize SSMU ",0
"The group was urging students to vote against Lew , and two other board members who were deemed to be pro - Israel , alleging “ layers of corruption ” within the student government and favouritism in appointing board members , then singled out three members of the board “ who are all either fellows at the Canadian Jewish Political Affairs Committee , an organization whose explicit mandate is to promote pro - Israel discourse in Canadian politics , or primary organizers for the anti - BDS initiative at McGill ",1
” ,0
Boudreau made his clarification after it was pointed out the anti - Semitic language was published prior to the vote ,0
"While Democratize SSMU later apologized for the language and deleted it from its site , the damage had already been done , Boudreau concluded ",0
"Lew said he feels vindicated to some extent , but is concerned anti - Semitism is still a problem within student government ",0
"“ There have been some steps taken by the administration and the student body in the right direction , but it ’s certainly not over , ” he said ",0
"In the months leading up to the vote , there had been other anti - Semitic incidents , including a tweet by Igor Sadikov , an elected representative of students in McGill ’s faculty of arts , saying : “ punch a zionist ",1
” ,0
"Among the measures taken by SSMU after the October vote was the creation of a committee looking into the issue of anti - Semitism within the student government , which Lew sits on ",0
"On Wednesday , McGill Principal Suzanne Fortier said the University wants to ensure a safe space for all students ",0
"“ I would like to take this opportunity to make it clear that there is absolutely no place for anti - Semitism at McGill University and that , as principal and vice - chancellor , I will remain vigilant to ensure that all members of our community feel safe , welcomed and respected on our campuses ",1
” ,0
"In addition to ordering the report , Fortier set up a hotline to report incidents of of intolerance and a task force to investigate incidents of academic freedom and equity ",0
"Rabbi Reuben Poupko , the co - chair for Quebec of the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs , said it should be noted McGill in general is a safe space for Jewish students ",0
"However , he said any Jewish students thinking of being involved in student politics or activism “ will have encounters that are profoundly disturbing and unpleasant ",1
” ,0
"He said McGill is not alone in this respect , as this is a continent - wide phenomenon within student politics ",1
Democratize SSMU did not respond to a request for an interview ,0

"Last October , the Australian Broadcasting Corporation journalist Sarah Ferguson interviewed Hillary Clinton , over whom she fawned as “ the icon for your generation ” ",1
"This was the same Clinton who threatened to “ obliterate totally ” Iran and , who , as U.S. secretary of State in 2011 , was one of the instigators of the invasion and destruction of Libya as a modern state , with the loss of 40,000 lives ",1
"Like the invasion of Iraq , it was based on lies ",1
"When the Libyan President was murdered publicly and gruesomely with a knife , Clinton was filmed whooping and cheering ",1
"Thanks largely to her , Libya became a breeding ground for ISIS and other jihadists ",1
"Thanks largely to her , tens of thousands of refugees fled in peril across the Mediterranean , and many drowned ",1
WikiLeaks Exposed Clinton ,0
"Leaked emails published by WikiLeaks revealed that Hillary Clinton ’s foundation – which she shares with her husband – received millions of dollars from Saudi Arabia and Qatar , the main backers of ISIS and terrorism across the Middle East ",0
"As Secretary of State , Clinton approved the biggest arms sale ever — worth $ 80 billion — to Saudi Arabia , one of her foundation ’s principal benefactors ",1
"Today , Saudi Arabia is using these weapons to crush starving and stricken people in a genocidal assault on Yemen ",1
"Sarah Ferguson , a highly paid reporter , raised not a word of this with Hillary Clinton sitting in front of her ",1
"Instead , she invited Clinton to describe the “ damage ” Julian Assange did “ personally to you ” ",0
"In response , Clinton defamed Assange , an Australian citizen , as “ very clearly a tool of Russian intelligence ” and “ a nihilistic opportunist who does the bidding of a dictator ” ",1
She offered no evidence — nor was asked for any — to back her grave allegations ,1
"At no time was Assange offered the right of reply to this shocking interview , which Australia ’s publicly - funded state broadcaster had a duty to give him ",1
"As if that was n’t enough , Ferguson ’s executive producer , Sally Neighour , followed the interview with a vicious re - tweet : “ Assange is Putin ’s bitch ",1

There are many other examples of Vichy journalism ,1

Julian Assange has committed no crime ,0
He has never been charged with a crime ,0
The Swedish episode was bogus and farcical and he has been vindicated ,1

This truth was lost or buried in a media witch - hunt that disgracefully associated Assange with rape and misogyny ,1

That is why Assange is in mortal danger ,1
"Seven years ago , in Sydney , I arranged to meet a prominent Liberal Member of the Federal Parliament , Malcolm Turnbull ",0
"I wanted to ask him to deliver a letter from Gareth Peirce , Assange ’s lawyer , to the government ",0
"We talked about his famous victory — in the 1980s when , as a young barrister , he had fought the British Government ’s attempts to suppress free speech and prevent the publication of the book Spycatcher — in its way , a WikiLeaks of the time , for it revealed the crimes of state power ",0
"The prime minister of Australia was then Julia Gillard , a Labor Party politician who had declared WikiLeaks “ illegal ” and wanted to cancel Assange ’s passport — until she was told she could not do this : that Assange had committed no crime : that WikiLeaks was a publisher , whose work was protected under Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , to which Australia was one of the original signatories ",1
"In abandoning Assange , an Australian citizen , and colluding in his persecution , Prime Minister Gillard ’s outrageous behaviour forced the issue of his recognition , under international law , as a political refugee whose life was at risk ",1

Things to Do in an Emergency : “ What ’s Your Trade ? ” ,0
"Well , it ’s been quite a couple of news weeks for the Catholic Church , hey ? ",0
"McCarrick , Pineda / Maradiaga , Fr ",0
"James Larkin getting the boot in Dublin for upholding Catholic teaching on abortion … I know some people are , to put it bluntly , freaking out ",1
The anger of the laity over the McCarrick situation is boiling over into the Twitter feed of the people we still call “ the good bishops ” ,0
"Bishop Thomas Tobin of Providence RI , - nicknamed the “ Good Tobin ” in contrast to the “ Bad Tobin ” and FrancisCardinal , Joseph Tobin of Newark – got quite an earful when he tweeted the other day , “ Despite the egregious offenses of a few , and despite the faults and sins we all have , I ’m very proud of my brother bishops and I admire and applaud the great work they do everyday for Christ and His Church ",1
” ,0
"The replies have n’t topped out yet , at 121 , nearly all of them expressing outrage at this cavalier attitude toward the revelation that Cardinal McCarrick has been proven to be a life - long homosexual rapist and sexual predator , grooming and trapping young men and children into unwanted sexual contact ; and that nearly the entire episcopate of the United States either colluded directly or kept quiet about it ",1
It ’s clear that even the “ good bishops ” have simply no idea how close they are to being bodily chucked out of their own churches by furious mobs ,0
"As I wrote elsewhere , since 2002 , most Catholics know perfectly well , despite the lame whitewashing attempt , that “ the US bishops gave themselves a pass ” on clerical sex abuse with the Dallas Charter “ a thing that brazenly shifted blame ",1
"” And it seems that though they ’re still doing this , quite a few lay Catholics just are n’t having it ",0
"We are seeing the final slide , the expected and inevitable result of the last 100 years ",0
"The Church was infiltrated , we know this , in the 19th century by some pretty dark forces , and they have finally come into the ascendancy and are showing themselves quite clearly for what they are ",1
The McCarrick news – and all the stuff swirling around it like the latest about Bishop Pineda and his connection to Pope Francis through Cardinal Maradiaga – has not come in contrast to this but as an intrinsic part of it ,0
"The scandal of McCarrick is simply a toxic emission , a venting of the gasses that build up naturally around any rotting thing ",1
Rod Dreher[1 ] is doing excellent work compiling testimony from priests and others saying out loud at last what many of us had known for many years about McCarrick and his gang ,0
"It has shown the world what Traditionalists have known , that it is emphatically NOT the result of one “ bad apple ” or even only a “ few ” as the hapless “ conservative ” Bishop Tobin tried to claim on Twitter ",0
This is the result of a mass - collusion ,0
"As our friend Steve Skojec put it the other day , “ We ’ve got to stop pretending it ’s just the progressive element in the Church ",0
"The ‘ conservatives’ are complicit , too ",0
"” In short , as it was during his days of glory , globe trotting on the dime of the State Department , hosting presidents for dinner and inviting John Paul II and Mother Theresa to tea , so it is now : McCarrick is the face of the New Paradigm ",0
"Whether he now has to go live in obscurity in some beach house in the Caymans , it will remain true : McCarrick is the “ New Church ",0
” ,0
A point that Dreher ’s informants have brought up needs to be made emphatic : the homosexualist cabal that is currently reported to be dominant in the Catholic hierarchy ( and do n’t imagine this is confined to the United States or even to the English speaking world ) have a well documented methodology of mutual protection - and - threat that keeps the whole apparatus afloat ,1
"In briefest and simplest possible terms , immoral or even illegal sexual activity is preferred because it leaves a man open to blackmail , to control through fear of exposure[2 ] ",0
"When that blackmailing culture becomes ascendant , it will always reject the morally upright as too dangerous , too difficult to control ",0
This is why faithful seminarians are rejected and why faithful priests are harassed ,0
"As Dreher reported , ",0
"When predatory gay priests run seminaries , they select on a bias for gay candidates ... ",1
"Gay seminarians who intend to be celibate , Sipe said , face tremendous pressure to have sex ",0
"If they slip up even once , their failure will be noted , and shared … And they will be made to understand that their lapse is remembered ",0
"Later , as a priest , predators within the priesthood have that knowledge to hold over the heads of other gay priests , to keep them silent if they ever have the desire to blow whistles ",0
"When I was covering the scandal in the early 2000s , I spoke to several , unconnected heterosexual men — priests , former priests , seminarians — who said that gay seminary rectors or diocesan officials encouraged them to take female sexual partners , so that they too would be complicit in sexual secret - keeping , and therefore no longer [ be ] a potential danger ",0
Nothing in a system like that is a greater threat to the corrupt than men who are not corrupt ,0
"For many priests , one might say all good priests , this is not a sustainable situation , to say the least ",0
I ’ve had quite a few conversations with priests who are now asking how to deal with it ,0
How are they to continue to offer the sacraments in this situation ? ,0
Where are they to live ? ,0
How are they to maintain themselves ? ,0
"These are the priests who did make it through this institutional gauntlet , who remain faithful now but are still under the control of these often grossly corrupt and evil men ",1
"As men known to be incorruptible themselves , there is a big target painted on their backs ",0
"In short , not only can a bad bishop harry a man out of his ministry , he has complete control over the priest ’s material life ",0
"The bishop can , with the flick of a pen or a single phone call , render a priest homeless , penniless and jobless ",0
"And these , remember , are men , often well on in years , whose only education and employment training has likely been academic degrees in philosophy and theology , and whose only professional contacts are ecclesiastical ",0
"Moreover , because of the globalisation of the bishop - network , a man blackballed for his authentic Catholicity will be a pariah in every diocese in the world ",0
"And with the advent of Bergoglio in Rome , there are no more havens ; as many of the former Franciscan Friars of the Immaculate have learned , the blackballing has gone global with this pontificate ",0
He will remain a pariah even among the so - called “ good ” bishops who live in terror of the immense power of the cabal … ( see above re : McCarrick & President Bush / John Paul II ,0
) ,0
"I have been hearing from priests who are saying in effect , “ We ’re trapped in this situation and forced to remain silent because if we do n’t we ’ll not only be unable to function as priests , but we ’ll be homeless and penniless ",0
We ’re unemployable in any other field ,0
"” And as much as we might be tempted to say , “ Well suck it up , this is for the good of souls , ” the reality is that these are not small considerations ",1
Many priests are getting older – many of them with health issues – and a man who has already given 20 or 30 years of his life to the Church is faced with a practical impossibility if he finds himself blacklisted ,0
Of course there are some who do n’t fit this mould ; there are a lot of second careers in the priesthood and plenty of people go into seminary after some years in the normal workforce and can go back to it at need ,0
"Some of the men now coming forward with complaints against McCarrick , who left the priesthood over their experiences , have gone on to have normal , healthy working lives ",0
But I think honestly most priests are in this corner and they know it and so do their bishops ,0
"I think a young man goes forward in great faith , spends ten to fifteen years studying philosophy and theology - fields that have almost no application in the workforce outside academia or the Church - with the honest , and frankly fair , expectation of a lifetime of employment and a safety net at the end ",0
"As one of them said to me , “ The old arrangement was , ‘ Remain faithful , do the work , and we will look after you ",0
"We ’ll house , feed and clothe you and look after your retirement.’ The new arrangement is a perversion of that : ‘ Keep quiet and go along with it all and you ’ll be fine , but step an inch out of line and we ’ll destroy you.’ ” ",1
So what do we do ? ,0
The Old Paradigm is destroyed and going along with the New Paradigm is a guarantee of destruction for yourself and everyone else ,0
"As we saw in Ireland this week , the Purge has started ",0
It ’s not enough to simply demand that a priest continue in his ministry no matter what ,0
We need to start working together with faithful priests – while there still are some – to help them create practical material alternatives ,0
"If we who still love the Church want priests to be faithful , and even to start denouncing the evil and corruption they see , we are going to have to help them create a modicum of independence and security in which to do it ",0
"The other day the American conservative writer , John Zmirak , wrote a sound suggestion on Twitter that I think it ’s time we all started taking seriously ",0
"In response to the continued outrages of both “ good ” and bad bishops , Zmirak suggested establishing “ an escrow fund in each scandal - plagued diocese , where laymen [ can ] deposit the funds they would have donated to [ the ] local church , until [ a ] new bishop [ is ] appointed ",0
” ,0
I responded : “ And the money could be used to purchase properties to house faithful priests punished by their bishops for refusing the New Paradigm ,0
"We could even perhaps buy a few convents so contemplative nuns could continue to pray in peace , without harassment from the evil men in Rome ",0
” ,0
I am hearing lately from laymen who are starting to talk about setting up financial structures to ensure that the authentic Catholic life can be maintained through what is obviously soon to be a general collapse of the institution ,0
"This would mean independent non - profit foundations that could build or buy church buildings , convents and even schools and provide salaries for priests and other staff ",0
"I started thinking about this recently when I received a note from a reader with a link to an online petition from Germany , addressed to the German bishops [ ! ! ! ] ",0
“ begging ” those manifestly evil and apostate men not to close a famous and ancient monastic house ,1
I responded that this was going about things the wrong way ,0
"Catholics are going to have to get their heads out of the mindset that they are helpless petitioners , “ begging ” the hierarchy to maintain the Faith ",0
"First of all , it only gives them a frisson of pleasure to see us groveling and begging for mercy ",0
"Let ’s not give them that , OK ? ",0
There ’s already enough “ frissons of pleasure ” in their lives ,0
"Second , it ’s simply not going to work ",0
"In Germany , in the US , in Canada , in Italy , in Britain … throughout the Church in the 1st world , and in much of it elsewhere , the men in charge of the “ institutional Church ” – that is , whose names are on the bank accounts – are dedicated to the destruction of everything we want to preserve ",1
The wolves are now looking with ravening eyes at the faithful ,1
"They are , in short , our enemies ",1
They ’ve become so by making themselves the enemies of Christ and His Holy Church ,0
They know it and it ’s time we stopped imagining otherwise ,0
The other suggestion I have is for young men interested in the priesthood to fortify themselves not only spiritually but in the material sphere ,0
There ’s one big vulnerability we can guard against pretty easily ,0
No one should be facing penury and permanent unemployment because he ’s a faithful Catholic ,0
We should never be letting any young man go into any diocesan seminary without being a property owner ,0
He should own a house or stand to inherit one ,0
Families have to come to see this as a duty to the child and to the Church ,0
"And more than that , the potential priest needs to have job skills that have nothing to do with the priesthood ",0
Among the working classes there is a bias against intellectual work ,0
But most working class people have a pretty sensible attitude towards ambitions in academia : get something under your belt you can fall back on ,0
How many philosophy PhDs can build himself a bookshelf ? ,0
Change the oil in a car ? ,0
Rewire a house ? ,0
The standard cliché of young people with useless academic degrees working at Starbucks has become so common it ’s not even worth memeing anymore ,0
How many young men do we foresee being forced out of seminary for having the wrong “ sexual orientation ” ? ,0
"Every one of those guys needs to be able to snap his fingers in the face of the rector and walk straight into a decent job , based not on any recommendation from a corrupt bishop , but on his solid skills ",0
"Among the white collar classes there is a bias against blue collar work , but the trades are crying out for skilled men and a trade school diploma in fixing tractors is a lot cheaper and a lot faster to get than a university degree ",0
That ’s an economic asset that we ca n’t afford to turn up our well - educated noses at ,0
Do n't miss Hilary White 's next article in the July 31 Print Edition of The Remnant Newspaper ; Subscribe today ! ,0
It reminds me of a discussion I had some years ago with the prior of a Benedictine monastery that is attracting a lot of young vocations ,0
One kid wanted to join and told me they had recommended he go to some college or other to study philosophy first ,0
"This college , apparently , waives much of the tuition and gives work studies to people going for the priesthood and religious life so they can avoid the student loan trap ",0
"This is fine , good idea ",0
But I asked him what he knew how to do ,0
“ Can you fix a bathroom pipe ? ,0
Do you know anything about what to feed a sheep or how to care for a cow ? ,0
"Can you drive a tractor ? ” This nice kid , who certainly does have a vocation , could read books and look things up on the internet and write a pretty mean paper on Thomas Aquinas , but not a lot else ",0
There is going to have to be a shift in attitude in our remaining faithful institutions ,0
Does a monastery really need all of its members to have PhDs in philosophy and theology ? ,0
"Would n’t it also be useful to have an electrician , a plumber , a carpenter , a cook , someone who knows how to fix a car or a tractor ? ",0
"Or for that matter , a certified accountant or an investment banker ? ",0
"If you insist on having people with degrees , maybe a degree in agriculture would be a good fit for a big monastic foundation with a lot of land like , say , Clear Creek or that new Carmelite place in Nebraska ",0
I think this is the time we are going to have to start overcoming our class snobbery ,0
"Young men with ambitions for the priesthood are going to have to tuck away employability and an independent financial foundation , in the same way people used to tuck money away against a rainy day ",0
"Simply put , they ’ve got to stop being materially dependent on the hierarchy ",0
This vulnerability is a gun to their heads in this time ,0
"The next kid who says anything to me about wanting to enter the diocesan priesthood , I ’m going to ask , “ How sound is your investment portfolio ? ” The next candidate for religious life , I ’ll ask , “ Great ! ",0
What ’s your trade ? ,0
What do you have to fall back on ? ” ,0
"I ’m given to understand that some houses of the Congregation of the Oratory ask candidates to come with an independent income , which , given what we ’re seeing elsewhere does n’t sound like a bad idea ",0
Perhaps Catholic financial advisors could be encouraged to set up a programme to teach young men how to create a sound financial footing with investments ,0
"Meanwhile , we must refocus our energy on the Faith itself , instead of the physical and even canonical structures that house it ",0
That monastery in Germany is lost ,0
Those bishops want the property and they ’ll get it ,0
"What the group of laymen should be doing , instead of petitioning that it be saved , is finding a place where the nuns can live their charism of religious life without episcopal harassment ",0
Bishops wo n’t protect and support good priests ? ,0
Then it ’s up to us ,1
"The Vatican wants to force all religious congregations into the pants - wearing , Marxist anti - nun , LCWR pattern ? ",0
We ’re not helpless ,0
We start buying convent buildings and start a fund to support the nun - refugees ,0
"Our goal must be preserving the precious treasure , the Deposit of the Faith , the sacramental life , the great charisms and artifacts of the religious life ",0
I am reminded of what the curators of the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg did in the face of the advancing German army ,0
"They took down , packed up and hid the art treasures , some of the greatest in the world ",0
Over a million precious works of art were sent on trains to be hidden in the Urals ,0
"Two trains got away to safety , but one was still there when the Germans surrounded the city and began the siege ",0
The museum ’s website tells us : ,0
"“ Despite starvation and severely cold temperatures , the Museum continued its preservational functions ",0
"With only a skeleton staff left behind , it was difficult to protect the vast buildings and their sumptuous interiors against snow , wind and rain ",0
"Equipped with first - aid kits , wearing helmets and gloves , the Museum air wardens cleared away heaps of broken bricks and the remains of charred flooring after each bomb hit the building ; they helped dig out the living and the dead and bandage the wounded after raids in the surrounding area ",0
"Twelve air - raid shelters were fitted out in the basements of the Museum complex and until the first evacuations were made in March 1942 there were 12,000 people housed there permanently , among them the Museum Director , celebrated Academician Iosif Orbeli ",0
"” “ Hermitage staff both in Sverdlovsk and in Leningrad acted as museum attendants , continuing their scholarly activity and lecturing in hospitals , holding conferences , writing scholarly articles ",0
No items were lost during the evacuation ,0
” ,0
"To keep up everyone ’s morale , the museum staff , while bombs were falling and they and their patrons were equally starving , continued to give tours and lectures , describing perfectly the artworks that had been removed ",0
"They understood the value of what they had , and did everything within their power to preserve and protect it ",0
"Does this all sound a bit , well , schismatic ? ",0
Not necessarily ,0
"Any bishop who can demonstrate through his actions and not just with his tweets , who can prove that he is still a Catholic and not a wolf , is welcome to join us ",1
But we ’d be fools to wait for them ,0
"Whatever you might think of Archbishop Lefebvre ’s solution over the last few decades , it certainly seems inarguable that the “ state of emergency ” for which he was preparing has come at last ",0
"And in a state of emergency , certain norms are naturally suspended ",0
The simple fact is that soon there are going to be “ vagus ” priests who have been thrown out of their ministry for maintaining the Faith ,0
"There are going to be nuns and monks without homes , as in the England of Henry VIII ",0
I think it ’s only reasonable that those who also want to maintain the Faith should reach out to them and offer what shelter we can ,0
What we have seen this week is making it clear that we can simply no longer sit back and “ beg ” bishops to maintain and defend the Faith ,0
It ’s not enough now to go into seminary or a monastery with glowing eyes and a firm faith ,0
"Sentiment is n’t going to be much comfort when the young man is no longer so very young and finds himself standing on the street outside the chancery with no skills , no money , no job , ( no health insurance ) and no prospects ",0
"If it is true that we really are alone in this , then so be it ",1
Let ’s stop lamenting and start doing practical things about it ,0
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ,0
"[ 1 ] Dreher and others are asking some very important questions now about the activities of the men McCarrick is known to have mentored , one of whom is currently making interesting headlines as Pope Francis’ Cardinal Prefect of the new Dicastery for Laity , Family and Life , and as the primary organiser of the upcoming World Meeting of Families in his native Dublin ",0
"It should probably be noted that up to the time he left over a “ difference of opinion ” with the group ’s leadership , Cardinal Kevin Farrell as also deeply involved in the Legionaries of Christ ",0
"He joined in 1966 , was ordained in ’78 , and was quickly appointed to a high - ranking position as general director with responsibility for seminaries and schools of the Legionaries of Christ in Italy , Spain and Ireland until 1983 ",0
This period was at the peak of the power of the grotesquely corrupt Fr ,0
"Maciel , for whom it has been shown ALL the Legion ’s leadership was covering ",0
"The Farrell family ’s involvement in the Legion continues with his brother , Bishop Brian Farrell , who ordained 20 new priests to the questionable - but - officially - reformed community in 2015 ",0
A recent post to the official Regnum Christi website shows that Cardinal Kevin is still close enough to the Legion - related “ lay ” organisation to hire dicastery staff from their ranks ,0
"After he left the Legion , Kevin Farrell joined the diocesan clergy in Washington DC and became a protégé of the archbishop , Cardinal Wuerl ",0
"So close is he to McCarrick that Farrell ’s coat of arms , as Elizabeth Yore reported in these pages , is not much more than a tribute to his belatedly - disgraced mentor ",0
"So , someone in a journalistic capacity might want to be asking a few questions about these things too ",0
"[ 2 ] It should also be noted that in his book , The Dictator Pope , historian Henry Sire documented that this is how Jorge Bergoglio has always operated , collecting bad men around him and controlling them with a masterful combination of threats and rewards ",0
"The natural question , “ Why does Pope Francis keep such bad men around him ? ” is now easy to answer ",0
"3rd Highest Ranked Dem Civil Rights Hero Appeared w / Farrakhan , Wo n't Condemn ",0

Tenth bishop signs ‘ Profession of Immutable Truths’ in defense of marriage ,0
"NewsCatholic Church , Family , Marriage ",0
"ROME , February 6 , 2018 ( LifeSiteNews ) – His Excellency Elmar Fischer , bishop emeritus of Feldkirch , Austria , has signed the “ Profession of Immutable Truths about Sacramental Marriage , ” LifeSiteNews confirmed on Monday ",0
Bishop Fischer is the tenth prelate to sign the profession ,0
"As has been widely reported , three bishops in Kazakhstan – Tomash Peta , Jan Pawel Lenga , and Athanasius Schneider – issued a Profession of the Immutable Truths about Sacramental Marriage on Dec. 31 , 2017 ",0
"The profession was made public on Jan. 2 , 2018 ",0
"In the document , the three bishops solemnly professed the Church ’s received teaching and discipline regarding sacramental marriage and the limited conditions ( see Familiaris Consortio , n. 84 ) under which Catholics who are civilly divorced and joined in a second union may receive sacramental absolution and Holy Communion ",1
"Ordained to the priesthood in 1961 , Fischer headed the Marriage and Family Centre of the Feldkirch diocese from 1979 to 1990 ",0
"After serving as vicar general of the diocese from 1989 , in 2005 Pope Benedict XVI appointed him bishop of Felkirch where he served until 2011 , retiring at the age of 75 ",0
"Bishop Fischer ’s support of the profession comes one week after Bishop Athanasius Schneider , auxiliary of Astana , Kazakstan , invited the world ’s bishops to sign the document and join in raising a common voice in defense of the sanctity and the indissolubility of marriage ",1
"“ God decides the time , and the time will come when the Pope and the episcopacy again will proclaim , with all clarity , unambiguity and beauty , the sanctity of marriage , and of the family , and of the Eucharist , ” Schneider told LifesiteNews in an exclusive Jan. 15 interview ",1
"Schneider said greater public support of the document from the world ’s 5,000 bishops would be “ a stronger voice for professing the constant truths of the Church , and it would be a beautiful common voice defending the sanctity and the indissolubility of marriage in the midst of a real neo - pagan society where divorce has become a plague and where sexual depravity is increasingly spreading ",1
” ,1
Bishop Fischer ’s public support of the Profession of Immutable Truths about Sacramental Marriage brings the number of signatories to nine bishops and one cardinal ,0
"To date , in addition to the three original signatories from Kazakstan , the following prelates have signed the profession : ",0
"• Cardinal Janis Pujats , Emeritus Archbishop Metropolitan of Riga , Latvia ",0
• Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò of Italy and former apostolic nuncio to the United States ,0
"• His Excellency Luigi Negri , Archbishop emeritus of Ferrara - Comacchio , Italy ",0
"• Bishop Andreas Laun , Emeritus Auxiliary of Salzburg , Austria ",0

Nigel Farage Warns “ We ’ll Lose ” A Battle Between the West and Islam ,0
"British politician Nigel Farage once helped convince Britons to vote for Brexit and separate from the European Union , but British establishment politicians have done everything they could to sabotage that vote since then ",1
"Now Farage has apparently decided that if he ca n’t beat them , he ’ll join them — if not on Brexit , then in their stance of denial and appeasement regarding the global jihad threat.’ ",1
"At a recent dinner of the UK Independence Party ( UKIP ) , which he formerly headed , Farage said : “ If dealing with Islamic fundamentalism becomes a battle between us and the entire religion , I ’ll tell you the result : we ’ll lose ",1
"We will simply lose … .We absolutely have to get that Muslim majority living in many of our towns and cities on our side , more attuned to Western values than some pretty hardline interpretations of the Qur’an ",1
” ,0
Sure ,0
Now how does Farage propose to do that ? ,0
His warning against making the resistance to jihad a “ battle between us and the entire religion ” is odd ,1
No sane person is saying that the West should go to war with the entire Islamic world ,1
"The likeliest interpretation of his statement is that he is saying that we must not speak about how jihadis find justification for their actions in the Qur’an and Sunnah , as that will alienate the “ moderates ",1

"But if we do n’t speak about such facts , how will we ever convince Muslims not to follow “ hardline interpretations of the Qur’an ” ? ",1
Another problem with Farage ’s statement is that it manifests a remarkable ignorance of history ,1
"While he is deeply concerned that British people not begin to think that resisting jihad terror means that they are in a “ battle ” with the “ entire religion ” of Islam , he appears unaware of the fact that many Muslims throughout history have considered their entire religion to be at war with the entire non - Muslim world ",1
I document this abundantly in my new book The History of Jihad From Muhammad to ISIS ,1
"To take one of innumerable examples , Sharaf ad - Din Ali Yazdi , a fifteenth - century Persian who wrote a biography of the Mongol Muslim warrior Tamerlane , observed that “ the Qur’an says the highest dignity man can attain is that of making war in person against the enemies of his religion ",1
"Muhammad advises the same thing , according to the tradition of the Muslim doctors : wherefore the great Temur always strove to exterminate the infidels , as much to acquire that glory , as to signalise himself by the greatness of his conquests ",1
” ,0
"After conquest came dhimmitude , the subjugated status that the Qur’an mandates for “ the People of the Book ” ( primarily Jews and Christians ) ",1
"In the early twelfth century , the Fatimid caliph Al - Amir bi - Ahkamillah issued this edict : ",1
"Now , the prior degradation of the infidels in this world before the life to come — where it is their lot — is considered an act of piety ; and the imposition of their poll tax [ jizya ] , “ until they pay the tribute out of hand and have been humbled ” ( Koran 9:29 ) is a divinely ordained obligation … .The dhimmi ’s payment of his dues by a bill drawn on a Muslim , or by delegating a real believer to pay it in his name will not be tolerated ",1
"It must be exacted from him directly in order to vilify and humiliate him , so that Islam and its people may be exalted and the race of infidels brought low ",1
"The jizya is to be imposed on all of them in full , without exception ",1
Underlying this subjugation is a deep contempt for non - Muslims ,0
"In the year 718 , the Umayyad caliph Umar ibn Abd al - Aziz sent out a message to the governors of the various Islamic provinces : ",1
O you who believe ! ,1
The non - Muslims are nothing but dirt ,1
"Allah has created them to be partisans of Satan ; most treacherous in regard to all they do ; whose whole endeavor in this nether life is useless , though they themselves imagine that they are doing fine work ",1
"Upon them rests the curse of Allah , of the Angels and of man collectively ",1
We must not think that we are at war with the entire religion ,1
"But what , Mr. Farage , are we to think about the Muslims who consider themselves and their religion to be at war with us ? ",1
Nigel Farage has become just another mainstream hack politician ,1

– Bishop Robert Morlino ,0
This is what a courageous shepherd looks like ! ,1
"In our opinion , during the most vile clergy sex scandal in history , every bishop in the country must do exactly what Bishop Morlino has done , i.e. , issue a statement of fidelity to the Church ’s moral theology , specifically her teaching against the mortal sin of homosexual acts ",1
"In so doing , the bishops will incur the wrath of the enemies of the Church , yes ",0
"They will be crucified in the media , yes ",0
But they will also be doing their sacred duty before God in reassuring their thoroughly scandalized flocks that they are absolutely committed to the defense and enforcement of the Church ’s moral teaching at a time when it is under scurrilous attack from within ,1
Nothing less will do ,0

"The stories being brought into light and displayed in gruesome detail with regard to some priests , religious , and now even those in places of highest leadership , are sickening ",1
"Hearing even one of these stories is , quite literally , enough to make someone sick ",0
But my own sickness at the stories is quickly put into perspective when I recall the fact that many individuals have lived through them for years ,0
"For them , these are not stories , they are indeed realities ",0
"To them I turn and say , again , I am sorry for what you have suffered and what you continue to suffer in your mind and in your heart ",0
"If you have not already done so , I beg you to reach out , as hard as that may be , and seek help to begin to heal ",0
"Also , if you ’ve been hurt by a priest of our diocese , I encourage you to come forward , to make a report to law enforcement and to our Victim ’s Assistance Coordinator , so that we might begin , with you as an individual , to try and set things right to the greatest extent possible ",0
There is nothing about these stories that is okay ,0
"These actions , committed by more than a few , can only be classified as evil , evil that cries out for justice and sin that must be cast out from our Church ",1
"Faced with stories of the depravity of sinners within the Church , I have been tempted to despair ",0
And why ? ,0
The reality of sin — even sin in the Church — is nothing new ,0
"We are a Church made of sinners , but we are sinners called to sanctity ",0
So what is new ? ,0
"What is new is the seeming acceptance of sin by some in the Church , and the apparent efforts to cover over sin by them and others ",0
"Unless and until we take seriously our call to sanctity , we , as an institution and as individuals , will continue to suffer the “ wages of sin ",0
” ,0
For too long we have diminished the reality of sin — we have refused to call a sin a sin — and we have excused sin in the name of a mistaken notion of mercy ,0
"In our efforts to be open to the world we have become all too willing to abandon the Way , the Truth , and the Life ",0
In order to avoid causing offense we offer to ourselves and to others niceties and human consolation ,0
Why do we do this ? ,0
Is it out of an earnest desire to display a misguided sense of being “ pastoral ? ” Have we covered over the truth out of fear ? ,0
Are we afraid of being disliked by people in this world ? ,0
Or are we afraid of being called hypocrites because we are not striving tirelessly for holiness in our own lives ? ,0
"Perhaps these are the reasons , but perhaps it is more or less complex than this ",0
"In the end , the excuses do not matter ",0
We must be done with sin ,0
It must be rooted out and again considered unacceptable ,0
Love sinners ? ,0
Yes ,0
Accept true repentance ? ,0
Yes ,0
But do not say sin is okay ,0
"And do not pretend that grave violations of office and of trust come without grave , lasting consequences ",0
"For the Church , the crisis we face is not limited to the McCarrick affair , or the Pennsylvania Grand Jury Report , or anything else that may come ",0
The deeper crisis that must be addressed is the license for sin to have a home in individuals at every level of the Church ,0
"There is a certain comfort level with sin that has come to pervade our teaching , our preaching , our decision making , and our very way of living ",0
"If you ’ll permit me , what the Church needs now is more hatred ! ",0
"As I have said previously , St. Thomas Aquinas said that hatred of wickedness actually belongs to the virtue of charity ",0
"As the Book of Proverbs says “ My mouth shall meditate truth , and my lips shall hate wickedness ( Prov ",0
8:7 ) ,0
” It is an act of love to hate sin and to call others to turn away from sin ,0
"There must be no room left , no refuge for sin — either within our own lives , or within the lives of our communities ",0
"To be a refuge for sinners ( which we should be ) , the Church must be a place where sinners can turn to be reconciled ",0
In this I speak of all sin ,0
"But to be clear , in the specific situations at hand , we are talking about deviant sexual — almost exclusively homosexual — acts by clerics ",1
"We ’re also talking about homosexual propositions and abuses against seminarians and young priests by powerful priests , bishops , and cardinals ",0
"We are talking about acts and actions which are not only in violation of the sacred promises made by some , in short , sacrilege , but also are in violation of the natural moral law for all ",0
To call it anything else would be deceitful and would only ignore the problem further ,0
There has been a great deal of effort to keep separate acts which fall under the category of now - culturally - acceptable acts of homosexuality from the publically - deplorable acts of pedophilia ,0
"That is to say , until recently the problems of the Church have been painted purely as problems of pedophilia — this despite clear evidence to the contrary ",0
It is time to be honest that the problems are both and they are more ,0
"To fall into the trap of parsing problems according to what society might find acceptable or unacceptable is ignoring the fact that the Church has never held ANY of it to be acceptable — neither the abuse of children , nor any use of one ’s sexuality outside of the marital relationship , nor the sin of sodomy , nor the entering of clerics into intimate sexual relationships at all , nor the abuse and coercion by those with authority ",0
"In this last regard , special mention should be made of the most notorious and highest in ranking case , that being the allegations of former - Cardinal Theodore McCarrick ’s ( oft - rumored , now very public ) sexual sins , predation , and abuse of power ",0
"The well - documented details of this case are disgraceful and seriously scandalous , as is any covering up of such appalling actions by other Church leaders who knew about it based on solid evidence ",1
"While recent credible accusations of child sexual abuse by Archbishop McCarrick have brought a whole slew of issues to light , long - ignored was the issue of abuse of his power for the sake of homosexual gratification ",0
It is time to admit that there is a homosexual subculture within the hierarchy of the Catholic Church that is wreaking great devastation in the vineyard of the Lord ,0
"The Church ’s teaching is clear that the homosexual inclination is not in itself sinful , but it is intrinsically disordered in a way that renders any man stably afflicted by it unfit to be a priest ",0
"And the decision to act upon this disordered inclination is a sin so grave that it cries out to heaven for vengeance , especially when it involves preying upon the young or the vulnerable ",1
Such wickedness should be hated with a perfect hatred ,1
Christian charity itself demands that we should hate wickedness just as we love goodness ,0
"But while hating the sin , we must never hate the sinner , who is called to conversion , penance , and renewed communion with Christ and His Church , through His inexhaustible mercy ",0
"At the same time , however , the love and mercy which we are called to have even for the worst of sinners does not exclude holding them accountable for their actions through a punishment proportionate to the gravity of their offense ",0
"In fact , a just punishment is an important work of love and mercy , because , while it serves primarily as retribution for the offense committed , it also offers the guilty party an opportunity to make expiation for his sin in this life ( if he willingly accepts his punishment ) , thus sparing him worse punishment in the life to come ",0
"Motivated , therefore , by love and concern for souls , I stand with those calling for justice to be done upon the guilty ",0
"The sins and crimes of McCarrick , and of far too many others in the Church , bring suspicion and mistrust upon many good and virtuous priests , bishops , and cardinals , and suspicion and mistrust upon many great and respectable seminaries and so many holy and faithful seminarians ",0
The result of the first instance of mistrust harms the Church and the very good work we do in Christ ’s name ,0
"It causes others to sin in their thoughts , words , and deeds — which is the very definition of scandal ",0
"And the second mistrust harms the future of the Church , since our future priests are at stake ",0
I said that I was tempted to despair in light of all of this ,0
"However , that temptation quickly passed , thanks be to God ",0
"No matter how large the problem , we know that we are called to go forward in faith , to rely upon God ’s promises to us , and to work hard to make every bit of difference we can , within our spheres of influence ",0
"I have recently had the opportunity to talk directly with our seminarians about these very pressing matters , and I have begun to , and will continue to , talk with the priests of the diocese , as well as the faithful , in person and through my weekly column and homilies , making things as clear as I can , from my perspective ",0
"Here now , I offer a few thoughts to those of my diocese : ",0
"In the first place , we must continue to build upon the good work which we have accomplished in protecting the youth and vulnerable of our diocese ",0
"This is a work on which we can never rest in our vigilance , nor our efforts to improve ",0
"We must continue in our work of education for all and hold to the effective policies that have been implemented , requiring psychological exams for all candidates for ministry , as well as across - the - board background checks for anyone working with children or vulnerable individuals ",0
"Here again , I state , as we have done consistently , if you have knowledge of any sort of criminal abuse of children by someone in the Church , contact law enforcement ",0
If you need help in contacting law enforcement contact our Victim ’s Assistance Coordinator and she will help connect you with the best resources ,0
"If you are an adult victim of sexual abuse from childhood , we still encourage you to reach out to law enforcement first , but even if you do n’t want to , please still reach out to us ",0
"To our seminarians : If you are unchastely propositioned , abused , or threatened ( no matter by whom ) , or if you directly witness unchaste behavior , report it to me and to the seminary rector ",0
I will address it swiftly and vigorously ,1
I will not stand for this in my diocese or anywhere I send men for formation ,1
"I trust that the seminaries I choose , very discriminately , to help form our men will not ignore this type of scandalous behavior , and I will continue to verify that expectation ",1
"To our priests : Most simply , live out the promises you made on your ordination day ",0
"You are called to serve Christ ’s people , beginning with praying daily the Liturgy of the Hours ",0
This is to keep you very close to God ,0
"In addition , you promised to obey and be loyal to your bishop ",0
"In obedience , strive to live out your priesthood as a holy priest , a hard working priest , and a pure and happy priest — as Christ Himself is calling you to do ",0
"And by extension , live a chaste and celibate life so that you can completely give your life to Christ , the Church , and the people whom he has called you to serve ",0
God will give you the graces to do so ,0
Ask Him for the help you need daily and throughout every day ,0
"And if you are unchastely propositioned , abused , or threatened ( no matter by whom ) , or if you directly witness unchaste behavior , report it to me ",0
I will not stand for this in my diocese any more than in our seminaries ,1
"To the faithful of the diocese : If you are the victim of abuse of any kind by a priest , bishop , cardinal , or any employee of the Church , bring it forward ",0
It will be addressed quickly and justly ,0
"If you have directly witnessed sexual advances or any type of abuse , bring it forward as well ",0
Such actions are sinful and scandalous and we can not allow anyone to use their position or power to abuse another person ,1
"Again , in addition to injuring individuals , these actions injure the very Body of Christ , His Church ",0
"Furthermore , I add my name to those calling for real and sustained reform in the episcopate , priesthood , our parishes , schools , universities , and seminaries that would root out and hold accountable any would - be sexual predator or accomplice ; ",0
"I will hold the priests of the diocese to their promise to live a chaste and celibate life of service to you and your parish , and evidence of failure in this regard will be justly addressed ; ",0
I will likewise hold every man studying for the priesthood for our diocese accountable to living a chaste and celibate life as part of his formation for the priesthood ,0
Failure to do so will lead to dismissal from diocesan sponsorship ; ,0
"I will continue to require ( with our men and our funds ) that all seminaries to which we send men to study be vigilant that seminarians are protected from sexual predators and provide an atmosphere conducive to their holistic formation as holy priests , in the image of Christ ; ",0
"I ask all the faithful of the diocese to assist in keeping us accountable to civil authorities , the faithful in the pews , and to God Almighty , not only to protect children and the youth from sexual predators in the Church , but our seminarians , university students , and all the faithful as well ",0
"I promise to put any victim and their sufferings before that of the personal and professional reputation of a priest , or any Church employee , guilty of abuse ; ",0
I ask everyone reading this to pray ,0
Pray earnestly for the Church and all her ministers ,1
Pray for our seminarians ,1
And pray for yourselves and your families ,1
"We must all work daily on our own personal holiness and hold ourselves accountable first and , in turn , hold our brothers and sisters accountable as well , and ",0
"Finally , I ask you all to join me and the entire clergy of the Diocese of Madison in making public and private acts of reparation to the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus and to the Immaculate Heart of Mary for all the sins of sexual depravity committed by members of the clergy and episcopacy ",0
"I will be offering a public Mass of reparation on Friday , September 14 , the Feast of the Triumph of the Holy Cross , at Holy Name Heights and I ask all pastors to do the same in their own parishes ",0
"In addition , I ask that all priests , clergy , religious , and diocesan employees join me in observing the upcoming Autumn Ember Days ( Sep. 19 , 21 , and 22 ) as days of fasting and abstinence in reparation for the sins and outrages committed by members of the clergy and episcopacy and I invite all the faithful to do the same ",0
"Some sins , like some demons , can only be driven out by prayer and fasting ",0
"This letter and these statements and promises are not intended to be an exhaustive list of what we can and need to do in the Church to begin to heal from , and stave off , this deep illness in the Church , but rather the next steps I believe we can take locally ",0
"More than anything else , we as a Church must cease our acceptance of sin and evil ",0
We must cast out sin from our own lives and run toward holiness ,0
We must refuse to be silent in the face of sin and evil in our families and communities and we must demand from our pastors — myself included — that they themselves are striving day in and day out for holiness ,0
We must do this always with loving respect for individuals but with a clear understanding that true love can never exist without truth ,0
"Again , right now there is a lot of justified anger and passion coming from many holy and faithful lay people and clerics across the country , calling for real reform and “ house cleaning ” of this type of depravity ",0
I stand with them ,0
I do n’t know yet how this will play out nationally or internationally ,0
"But I do know this , and I make this my last point and last promise , for the Diocese of Madison : “ As for me and my household , we will serve the Lord ",0
” ,0
"Faithfully yours in the Lord , ",0

Willfully Ignorant FBI Ca n't Discover Motive For Muslim Jihadi Who Drove Into Propane Tanks At Travis Air Force Base ,1
"“ We do n’t have any nexus of terrorism at this point , ” Ragan said ",0
"That means they did n’t find an ISIS membership card in his wallet , or lots of phone calls to Iraq or Syria , or a note from Kazi reading , “ I did this for Allah and Islam ",0
Allahu akbar ,1
” ,0
"Of course , even if they had found those things , given their track record of denial and deception , they may still be searching for Kazi ’s motive ",1
"In any case , a larger point is being lost here ",1
And that is that there is a war going on ,1
"We know that the Islamic State , al - Qaeda and other groups have called upon Muslims in the U.S. to try to kill military personnel and police , as well as civilians ",1
"We know that Kazi , with all the propane and gas tanks in his car , was clearly trying to set off a major fire that would kill more people than just himself ",0
"Even if he was n’t on the phone to Baghdadi , the likelihood is that when a Muslim drives into a U.S. Air Force Base with a car full of incendiaries , probably this has something to do with the global jihad ",0
"The FBI ’s bafflement here is part of its deep , deep corruption ",0
"The FBI does n’t acknowledge that there is a global jihad , or that Islam has anything to do with terrorism ",0
"It does n’t admit that there is a war going on , and treats each act of Islamic terror as if it were a separate and discrete criminal event , unrelated to all the others ",0
"So , each time something like this happens , they ’re back at Square One , trying to figure out motive ",0
"It ’s as if the U.S. Army stopped to interrogate every German soldier who crashed through the Ardennes Forest at the beginning of the Battle of the Bulge in 1944 , to see if each one ’s actions had anything to do with the German Army and Adolf Hitler ’s war aims ",1
This willful ignorance leads to a diversion and waste of resources that is astronomical and catastrophic ,1
"“ Motive a mystery in car explosion at Travis Air Force Base , ” by Phil Willon , Los Angeles Times , March 23 , 2018 : ",0
Federal investigators on Friday said that the person who drove a burning minivan filled with propane and gas tanks into the front gate of Travis Air Force Base in Northern California was a 51-year - old Bay Area man originally from India ,0
"Hafiz Kazi was a legal permanent resident and had lived in the United States since 1993 , said Sean Ragan , FBI special agent in charge of the Sacramento field office ",0
"Kazi had lived in the Bay Area , including Sausalito , Ragan said , but his most recent place of residence was not known ",0
Investigators have yet to determine a motive for the Wednesday night attack or evidence that anyone else was involved ,0
"“ We do n’t have any nexus of terrorism at this point , ” Ragan said , adding that aspect of the case was still being investigated ",0
"“ Now the question is , why ",0
Why was he there ? ,0
What led him there ? ,0
"And we do n’t know answers to that , quite frankly ",0
"” Kazi drove the Kia minivan through the front gate of the military base , which is near Fairfield , around 7 p.m. Wednesday ",0
"Security personnel saw flames inside the van , which crashed shortly after going through the gate , Ragan said ",0
Emergency responders initially did not know if it was an attack or some sort of mishap ,0
"But when they opened the doors to the minivan they found five propane tanks , three plastic one - gallon gas cans , several lighters , three phones and a gym bag with personal items , Ragan said … ",0
"The dead man ’s religious beliefs and affiliation are not known at this point , said Ragan , who debunked a rumor that some sort of “ jihad ” video was found on Kazi ’s phone … ",0

"MAJOR NEW STUDY : Homeschooling Spikes Due to School Violence , Far - Left Bias ",0
"According to a 33-year - long study conducted by the National Home Education Research Institute in Oregon , the top three reasons that parents choose homeschooling are a desire to provide religious instruction or different values than those offered in public schools ; dissatisfaction with the academic curriculum , and worries about the school environment ",0
"As reported by The Washington Times , the recent school shooting at Parkland , Fla. , was the last straw for scores of parents ",0
"The paper noted that “ the phones started ringing at the Texas Home School Coalition , and they have n’t stopped yet ",0

"Uranium One Bombshell : Evidence of Bribery , Extortion , Kickbacks , Money Laundering , and More ! ",1
Right about now the people in the Clinton camp should be getting very nervous about the ongoing investigations into the Uranium One deal ,1
What must be most annoying for the Clinton team is that these investigations all started as a way to undermine the Trump administration and continue to push connections between Trump and Russia ,1
"Now , more than a year after the investigations began , it ’s looking less likely than ever that President Trump did anything wrong … but the investigations seem to be zeroing in on key Clinton team members ( including the Clintons themselves ) ",0
"On Tuesday night Fox News Sean Hannity sat down to talk about the exploding scandal that is the Uranium One deal , and what it could mean for the Clinton family ",0
"Hannity spoke with investigative reporter Sara Carter of Circa , John Solomon of The Hill , and Victoria Toensing , an attorney representing the FBI informant who allegedly possesses documents on the sale of Canadian mining company ‘ Uranium One’ to Russia interests back in 2010 ",0
Now that the NDA ( non disclosure agreement ) has been lifted Circa ’s Sara Carter is “ reporting that she has received a treasure trove of documents that in fact prove tonight the FBI informant has knowledge of Russia ’s involvement in uranium one ,0
” ,0
"Not to be outdone , the Hill ’s John Solomon had found even more dirt on this ugly Clinton led deal ",1

"He has evidence , was on the inside , directly from Putin ’s Russia , the push for nuclear fuel deals , and all the crimes we talked about , bribery , kickback , extortion , money laundering , racketeering , all knelt corroborating and will be corroborated even further ",0
Go into your report ,0
"JOHN SOLOMON , THE HILL : You know , Sara just said something about the importance of the dominance of the uranium market ",0
This is an email that the FBI has had for six years ,0
"It shows that uranium one was part of a Russia strategy to control , not just benefit from the global market , controlled the global market ",1
That would put the United States at a disadvantage ,0
That is the sort of evidence that this FBI informant has right now ,0
"If you go back on the last week we heard several things from the Justice Department , there ’s no connection to uranium one ",0
These are emails that say uranium one that are in the FBI files ,0
They said that there was no connection between the uranium one case and the criminal case ,0
"We now know the criminal case got its first evidence in 2009 , a whole year before the uranium one deal was approved by the Obama administration ",0
There are a lot of things that people have been saying that these documents simply do n’t agree with ,0
HANNITY : All right ,0
"I got a very high ranking Congressman and that knows , let us put it that way , and actually sent me a note ",0
"The knowledge of key administration officials will be the next thing proven by both of you , and the links to the Clinton foundation ",0
"Sara , is that true ? ",0
CARTER : I believe that is true ,0
I mean especially when we at — ,0
HANNITY : Do believe or you know ? ,0
I ca n’t ask Victoria that question because she wo n’t tell me ,0
CARTER : I know it ’s true ,0
"I know that looking at these documents following the money , following the money is what ’s important here ",0
The Justice Department has not pointed out that they will possibly call a special counsel to this ,0
This is still out there ,0
They are looking into it ,0
That is something that they need to decide ,0
"But whether it ’s a special counsel or whether it ’s a prosecutor that is investigating this , they will be able to follow the money ",0
There are somethings said … ,0
"HANNITY : When you say follow the money , my suspicion would go to the money came directly from Russia , was funneled through the Canadian donors to the Clinton Foundation ",0
How good are my instincts ? ,0
CARTER : You have pretty good instincts ,0
I think there ’s a lot of other areas that they will be looking at as well ,0
Remember this is like peeling back an onion ,1
You peel one part and then you find another part ,1
And that is what ’s going to require somebody to do an extensive investigation ,0
HANNITY : But it is beginning to cascade Sara ,0
CARTER : It is ,0
"HANNITY : John , I want her to respond to the same thing , that the Clinton Foundation , that this will be traced back to high - ranking Obama administration officials and the Clinton Foundation , and if you add the money portion Sara mentioned ? ",0
SOLOMON : I do ,0
I think the place we will be talking about in the next couple weeks as the Clinton global initiative ,0
Sort of a side project of the Clinton Foundation ,0
There are new flows of money there that we will report on then the next couple of weeks ,0
"There were also some personal business projects , some very senior Clinton people that got a remarkable infusion of cash from Russia ",1
It will be able to talk about that in the next couple of weeks ,0
Another layer of interest of the story ,0
HANNITY : All right ,0
We have a lot of time in the segment so I want to go very slowly here ,0
"Both of you , before I get to Victoria , Sara and John , you both in your pieces said 5,000 documents ",0
"I hear the number the FBI informant is much , much greater , tens of thousands ",0
True or false ? ,0
SOLOMON : That seems to be accurate ,0
We have a subset of the documents and they are very voluminous ,0
HANNITY : Now let me go to Victoria ,0
One of the great attorneys ,0
She is the most difficult to get any information out of ,0
"Victoria , one of the things I ’ve known about you , and I ’ve interviewed you so many times over the years , you now have been doing a deep dive into all of this ",0
You are now representing this FBI informant ,0
"I think they will become an American hero out of all of this , but apparently , he was fighting and begging and pleading and saying the Russians are here , they are doing this , why are you paying attention ? ",1
"I hope my instincts are right there , and number two , how devastating it legally is this going to be based on what I was just asking Sara and John about impacting former Obama officials , money , Clinton foundation ? ",1
"VICTORIA TOENSING , ATTORNEY REPRESENTING FBI INFORMANT : Let me go to number one first , that is the whole essence of what John and Sara and I are talking about is that in 2009 , 2010 , our FBI and presumably our Justice Department , and the White House , as my client was told , all knew about this corruption in the Russian nuclear energy area ",0
There ’s no separate companies ,0
They are all related ,0
"The Russian nuclear energy is controlled from the top , from Putin ",1
They are all one ,0
They all talk to each other ,0
"So the evidence about this corruption was known to our government in 2009 , 2010 , and why is it that CFIUS either was n’t told , or CFIUS people knowing about it — ",0
"HANNITY : Explain CFIUS , 13 agencies , I am sorry 9 agencies approving the deal that gave control of uranium one to the bad actor , hostile regime , Putin Russia ",1
"TOENSING : They said , the CFIUS board said that the bad Russians could buy uranium one , which contains access to 20 percent of the U.S. ",1
"Uranium , why was that decision made ? ",0
Was CFIUS told ? ,0
Did Bob Mueller go to Eric Holder and tell him ? ,0
Eric Holder sat on it ,0
HANNITY : He was one of the nine ,0
TOENSING : Did Bob Mueller go to the White House and tell him ? ,0
The FBI agents told my client that they were briefing the President about his conduct ,0
"Of course , when the CFIUS decision was made ",0
"My client said , what happened ? ",0
"HANNITY : Back to my original question , counselor , if I may ",0
You are too good at your job ,0
This is a very serious point ,0
"Putting your legal hat on , objectively speaking , yes they knew , the evidence will prove it based on the documents and your client , crimes committed on a high level ? ",0
National security compromise ? ,0
"TOENSING : Of course , it goes without saying giving the Russians control of the uranium was a national security compromise ",1
I think that we are going to have to do is continue to follow the money because the reporting that John and Sara are going to be doing in a few days will be revealing about where lots of the various money went and where it came from ,0
"HANNITY : Always we go back , and I believe at the end of this you guys deserve a Pulitzer , and I ’m not the only one thinking that ",0
"You have dug so deep on this , this has been a deep dive and I applaud you both ",0
"I want to ask as it relates to who knew what , and when ",0
"What did they know , when did they know it , John Solomon ? ",0
"I ’m talking about Obama , Mueller , Eric Holder , and Hillary Clinton ",0
"SOLOMON : We are at a little disadvantage right now , because we do n’t have those records , and also the records that Congress needs to go get , but I can tell you I have a person quoted in my story who has direct knowledge of what the Justice Department knew ",0
"This person said without a shred of doubt , we knew in 2009 a year before CFIUS ruled that Thomas were engaged in criminality , without a shadow of a doubt , we knew that Russia was trying to gain a corner on the U.S. market , get a strong hold on our uranium , and without a doubt we knew they were using political levers to try to get their way here ",1
"We are talking about control , like this document says , they are trying to gain control of our markets ",1
That has to be national security interest that should have been raised in CFIUS ,1
HANNITY : President daily briefings were told ,0
Had this information in it before CFIUS approves this ,0
CARTER : Sean ,0
That is what we need to find out ,0
We need to see those Presidential daily briefings ,0
Congress can get those ,0
"They will be able to know whether or not President Obama was briefed on this and according to a number of people that I have spoken with as well , he was ",0
"I think that will reveal a whole other layer of who knew what , where and when ",0
"And we follow the money and it will reveal even more about Hillary Clinton and what she knew and when did she know it , and the other members of the CFIUS board ",0
HANNITY : And Obama and Holder and Mueller ? ,0
"John , real quick , we are running out of time ",0
"SOLOMON : yes listen , I think even Sessions and Rosenstein have questions to answer ",0
There are people in Congress who do n’t think they ’ve gotten a straight answer from them ,0
HANNITY : All right ,0
"Victoria , we get the last word from you , laws broken ? ",0
"TOENSING : Well , of course ",0
HANNITY : You are so good at your job ,0
You are so annoyingly good ,0
"The American people deserve the truth varied our security was compromised , we import uranium , because we do n’t have enough ",1
Newt Gingrich will weigh in on this and more things and about the Clintons ,0
Are they facing their day of reckoning ? ,0
And a big announcement at the end of the show ,0

Homeschooling Expands As Parents Seethe Over Liberal Social Engineering And Violence ,0
Homeschooling rates are skyrocketing as parents are continually getting more and more upset at the leftist social engineering taking place in public schools ,1
"The indoctrination is getting so bad , that some parents are even concerned about liberal violence against those who reject the brainwashing ",1
"According to The Washington Times , the recent school shooting at Parkland , Florida , was the last straw for scores of parents ",0
"The paper noted that “ the phones started ringing at the Texas Home School Coalition , and they have n’t stopped yet ",0
” ,0
"“ When the Parkland shooting happened , our phone calls and emails exploded , ” said coalition president Tim Lambert ",1
"“ In the last couple of months , our numbers have doubled ",0
"We ’re dealing with probably between 1,200 and 1,400 calls and emails per month , and prior to that it was 600 to 700 ",0
"” But according to Natural News , it is n’t just the rampant violence worrying some parents ",1
That ’s just the tip of the collectivist agenda iceberg ,0
"Christopher Chin , head of Homeschool Louisiana , told The Times that parents are fed up with “ the violence , the bullying , the unsafe environments ",1
"” Many parents are also disturbed by the social engineering , which amounts to brainwashing and indoctrination that goes on in a public school ",1
"For example , a Minnesota public school is forcing Kindergarten students to study ‘ white privilege’ ",1
The left - wing curriculum and common core are also driving parents to remove their children from public schools ,0
"Brian D. Ray , who heads up the National Home Education Research Institute , in Salem , Oregon , who ’s conducted homeschooling research for 33 years , told The Times that concern over school curriculum has reached the top of the charts for most parents ",0
"Ray said the top three reasons that parents choose homeschooling are a desire to provide religious instruction or different values than those offered in public schools ; dissatisfaction with the academic curriculum , and worries about the school environment ",0
"Since teachers are not allowed to arm themselves to defend their students against the violence often perpetrated at schools simply because they are gun free zones , homeschooling takes care of that problem ",1
"“ Most parents homeschool for more than one reason , ” Ray told the paper ",0
"“ But when we ask families why do they homeschool , near the top nowadays is concern about the environment of schools , and that includes safety , pressure to get into drugs , pressure to get into sexual activity ",0
It includes all of that ,0
” ,0
Indoctrination means to teach a person to accept a belief uncritically ,1
It ’s the very reason the governments of the world still exist ,1
People can not logically and critically understand that hurting people and taking their things is wrong – even if people who declare themselves government is the one doing it ,0
Governments are nothing more than a handful of people and have no right to aggress against others ,1
But humans are taught at a young age to never question this and that belief has kept most of humanity enslaved for centuries ,0
﻿ ,0
It is n’t a surprise that so many have decided to educate their children themselves ,0
"And as schools continue to fail , and authoritarian policies continue to wreak havoc on our society , more will wake up to the absolute horror of what allowing the state to educate our children has done to the moral fabric of humanity ",1
DOJ May Hit # Resistance Mayor Who Warned Illegal Criminals w / Obstruction of Justice ,0
ICE had already called out Oakland 's radical leftist boss for helping criminals and endangering ICE personnel by tipping them off that a raid was coming ,1
"Her actions were quite clearly illegal , though she claimed that she had cleared her actions with lawyers beforehand , And now , a member of the # Resistance may actually end up fighting obstruction of justice charges ",1
"Thomas Homan , the acting director of ICE , slammed Mayor Schaaf , who on Saturday night released an unprecedented warning that ICE was about to begin arresting people ",0
"Schaaf said she issued the alert after receiving confidential tips from “ credible sources , ” and conferring with attorneys to make sure she was n’t opening herself up to federal prosecution ",0
"The mayor ’s move endangered ICE officers and alerted their targets , Homan asserted , “ making clear that this reckless decision was based on her political agenda ",1
"” He said 864 “ criminal aliens and public safety threats remain at large in the community , and I have to believe that some of them were able to elude us thanks to the mayor ’s irresponsible decision ",1
"” Fox News , which was given a ride - along with ICE officers during the operation , reported that agency officials were asking the Department of Justice to investigate whether Schaaf broke any laws ",1
Now the DOJ is looking into Schaaf ,0
The Department of Justice is looking into whether Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf obstructed justice by warning Northern California residents of an impending raid by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) ,0
"The agency ’s acting director , Thomas Homan , told “ Fox & Friends ” Wednesday morning that the DOJ is “ reviewing ” whether Schaaf broke any laws by telling her constituents ICE would be raiding the area in order to arrest people violating federal immigration laws ",0
"Schaaf , a Democrat , posted the warning to Twitter Saturday , writing that “ multiple credible sources ” told her the immigration agency was “ preparing to conduct an operation in the Bay Area , including Oakland , starting as soon as ” Sunday ",1
"“ What she did is no better than a gang lookout yelling ‘ police’ when a police cruiser comes in the neighborhood , except she did it to a whole community , ” Homan told """""""" Fox & Friends ",1
""""""""" ",0
""""""""" There 's over 800 significant public safety threat criminals ... that we are unable to locate because of that warning , so that community 's a lot less safe than it would 've been ",1

“ A nice simple system that works ,0

"In fact , I 've often said if we catch people close to the border , we should not even bring them into the system if they are not citizens , but walk them back over the border and make sure they keep walking ",0
"Often , by putting illegals into the system , it takes years to deport them , which costs the American people lots of money ",1

Nigel Farage Warns “ We ’ll Lose ” A Battle Between the West and Islam ,0
"British politician Nigel Farage once helped convince Britons to vote for Brexit and separate from the European Union , but British establishment politicians have done everything they could to sabotage that vote since then ",0
"Now Farage has apparently decided that if he ca n’t beat them , he ’ll join them — if not on Brexit , then in their stance of denial and appeasement regarding the global jihad threat.’ ",0
"At a recent dinner of the UK Independence Party ( UKIP ) , which he formerly headed , Farage said : “ If dealing with Islamic fundamentalism becomes a battle between us and the entire religion , I ’ll tell you the result : we ’ll lose ",1
"We will simply lose … .We absolutely have to get that Muslim majority living in many of our towns and cities on our side , more attuned to Western values than some pretty hardline interpretations of the Qur’an ",1
” ,0
Sure ,1
Now how does Farage propose to do that ? ,0
His warning against making the resistance to jihad a “ battle between us and the entire religion ” is odd ,1
No sane person is saying that the West should go to war with the entire Islamic world ,0
"The likeliest interpretation of his statement is that he is saying that we must not speak about how jihadis find justification for their actions in the Qur’an and Sunnah , as that will alienate the “ moderates ",0

"But if we do n’t speak about such facts , how will we ever convince Muslims not to follow “ hardline interpretations of the Qur’an ” ? ",0
Another problem with Farage ’s statement is that it manifests a remarkable ignorance of history ,1
"While he is deeply concerned that British people not begin to think that resisting jihad terror means that they are in a “ battle ” with the “ entire religion ” of Islam , he appears unaware of the fact that many Muslims throughout history have considered their entire religion to be at war with the entire non - Muslim world ",1
I document this abundantly in my new book The History of Jihad From Muhammad to ISIS ,0
"To take one of innumerable examples , Sharaf ad - Din Ali Yazdi , a fifteenth - century Persian who wrote a biography of the Mongol Muslim warrior Tamerlane , observed that “ the Qur’an says the highest dignity man can attain is that of making war in person against the enemies of his religion ",1

"In the early twelfth century , the Fatimid caliph Al - Amir bi - Ahkamillah issued this edict : ",0
"Now , the prior degradation of the infidels in this world before the life to come — where it is their lot — is considered an act of piety ; and the imposition of their poll tax [ jizya ] , “ until they pay the tribute out of hand and have been humbled ” ( Koran 9:29 ) is a divinely ordained obligation … .The dhimmi ’s payment of his dues by a bill drawn on a Muslim , or by delegating a real believer to pay it in his name will not be tolerated ",1
"It must be exacted from him directly in order to vilify and humiliate him , so that Islam and its people may be exalted and the race of infidels brought low ",1
"The jizya is to be imposed on all of them in full , without exception ",0
Underlying this subjugation is a deep contempt for non - Muslims ,0
"In the year 718 , the Umayyad caliph Umar ibn Abd al - Aziz sent out a message to the governors of the various Islamic provinces : ",0
O you who believe ! ,0
The non - Muslims are nothing but dirt ,1
"Allah has created them to be partisans of Satan ; most treacherous in regard to all they do ; whose whole endeavor in this nether life is useless , though they themselves imagine that they are doing fine work ",1
"Upon them rests the curse of Allah , of the Angels and of man collectively ",0
We must not think that we are at war with the entire religion ,1
"But what , Mr. Farage , are we to think about the Muslims who consider themselves and their religion to be at war with us ? ",0

"Hundreds of Priests Accused in Pennsylvania , Church of Accompaniment in Crisis ",0
"The Pennsylvania Supreme Court on Tuesday released a sweeping grand jury report on sex abuse in the Catholic Church , listing hundreds of accused clergy and detailing 70 years of misconduct and church response across the state ",0
"The release is the culmination of an 18-month probe , led by state Attorney General Josh Shapiro , on six of the state ’s eight dioceses — Harrisburg , Pittsburgh , Allentown , Scranton , Erie and Greensburg — and follows other state grand jury reports that revealed abuse and coverups in two other dioceses ",0
Some details and names that might reveal the 300 clergy listed have been redacted from the report ,0
"Legal challenges by clergy delayed the report ’s release , after some said it is a violation of their constitutional rights ",0
Pennsylvania ’s Supreme Court ruled last month that the report must be released but with some redaction ,0
"The report ’s release begins an information war , with prosecutors and many victims saying it ’s the start of holding church leaders at the top accountable for the first time , while church lawyers and other advocates for the institution say the report depicts an era of another century , unfairly smearing today ’s Catholicism in Pennsylvania ",1
The report has helped renew a crisis many in the church thought and hoped had ended nearly 20 years ago after the scandal erupted in Boston ,1
"But recent abuse - related scandals , from Chile to Australia , have reopened wounding questions about accountability and whether church officials are still covering up crimes at the highest levels ",1
The new wave of allegations has called Pope Francis ’s handling of abuse into question as many Catholics look to him to help the church regain its credibility ,1
"The pope ’s track record has been mixed , something some outsiders attribute to his learning curve or shortcomings and others chalk up to resistance from a notoriously change - averse institution ",1
"The Pennsylvania grand jury report follows the resignation last month of Cardinal Theodore McCarrick , a towering figure in the U.S. church and former D.C. archbishop who was accused of sexually abusing minors and adults for decades ",1
"Both have further polarized the church on homosexuality , celibacy and whether laypeople should have more power ",0
It has also triggered debate about whether statutes of limitations should be expanded ,0
"“ We ’re dealing with a long - term struggle not only about the meaning of justice , but about the meaning of memory , ” said Jason Berry , a reporter and author who has covered the sexual abuse crisis for decades ",0

Did Oakland Mayor Tip Off La Raza to ICE Raid ? ,0
The story of the Oakland mayor who tipped off illegal alien criminals to ICE raids resulting in rapists and child sex offenders escaping arrest just keeps getting worse ,1
Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf shocked the nation when she issued a tweet and press release on February 24 warning about impending ICE raids ,1
"Schaaf refuses to say how she learned about the ICE raids , only saying it was not from official sources ",0
"“ I felt that it was my duty to share the information , ” Schaaf said ",0
"Whatever the leak pipeline looked like , it 's good odds that it began with Obama holdovers ensconced in the government ",1
"In emails we obtained through a public records request , we did n’t find out who her sources were , but we do know who she was talking to before she made her big announcement ",0
"Emails reveal that hours before the announcement , a group called Centro Legal de la Raza sent the mayor information on what employers should do in case of an ICE raid ",0
"Hours before the public was warned about ICE raids , some Oakland businesses got a head start , thanks to the mayor ",0
"According to emails , the Oakland Indie Alliance , a group of independent businesses , got a message saying “ Important Alert ! ",0
Credible information ICE Raids in Oakland Sunday 2/25 and Monday 2/26 ” and “ This information comes directly from the Mayor ,0
” ,0
Now that last part is significant ,0
Because there is no doubt that businesses employing illegal aliens are committing a crime ,1
"It is unlawful to hire an alien , to recruit an alien , or to refer an alien for a fee , knowing the alien is unauthorized to work in the United States .. An employer can be convicted of the felony of harboring illegal aliens who are his employees if he takes actions in reckless disregard of their illegal status , such as ordering them to obtain false documents , altering records , obstructing INS inspections , or taking other actions that facilitate the alien ’s illegal employment ",1
Any business that tips off illegal aliens admits that it is aware of their status ,0
"By passing along the warning , Mayor Schaaf was tipping off criminals committing a felony ",0

FBI Informant “ Threatened ” After Offering Details Linking Clinton Foundation To Russian Bribery Case ,1
This report was originally published by Tyler Durden at Zero Hedge ,0
"While the mainstream media has largely ignored it , the scandal surrounding Russian efforts to acquire 20 % of America ’s uranium reserves , a deal which was ultimately approved by the Obama administration , and more specifically the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States ( CFIUS ) which included Hillary Clinton and Eric Holder , is becoming more problematic for Democrats by the hour ",1
"As The Hill pointed out earlier this morning , the latest development in this sordid tale revolves around a man that the FBI used as an informant back in 2009 and beyond to build a case against a Russian perpetrator who ultimately admitted to bribery , extortion and money laundering ",1
"The informant , who is so far only known as “ Confidential Source 1 , ” says that when he attempted to come forward last year with information that linked the Clinton Foundation directly to the scandal he was promptly silenced by the FBI and the Obama administration ",0
"Working as a confidential witness , the businessman made kickback payments to the Russians with the approval of his FBI handlers and gathered other evidence , the records show ",0
"Sources told The Hill the informant ’s work was crucial to the government ’s ability to crack a multimillion dollar racketeering scheme by Russian nuclear officials on U.S. soil that involved bribery , kickbacks , money laundering and extortion ",0
"In the end , the main Russian executive sent to the U.S. to expand Russian President Vladimir Putin ’s nuclear business , an executive of an American trucking firm and a Russian financier from New Jersey pled guilty to various crimes in a case that started in 2009 and ended in late 2015 ",0
Toensing added her client has had contact from multiple congressional committees seeking information about what he witnessed inside the Russian nuclear industry and has been unable to provide that information because of the NDA ,0
"“ He ca n’t disclose anything that he came upon in the course of his work , ” she said ",0
The information the client possesses includes specific allegations that Russian executives made to him about how they facilitated the Obama administration ’s 2010 approval of the Uranium One deal and sent millions of dollars in Russian nuclear funds to the U.S. to an entity assisting Bill Clinton ’s foundation ,0
"At the time , Hillary Clinton was serving as secretary of State on the government panel that approved the deal , the lawyer said ",0
"It has been previously reported that Bill Clinton accepted $ 500,000 in Russian speaking fees in 2010 and collected millions more in donations for his foundation from parties with a stake in the Uranium One deal , transactions that both the Clintons and the Obama administration denied had any influence on the approval ",0
"In the midst of the new discoveries revealed yesterday about the Uranium One case ( see : FBI Uncovered Russian Bribery Plot Before Obama Approved Uranium One Deal , Netting Clintons Millions ) , “ Confidential Source 1 ” has once again hired an attorney , Victoria Toensing , a former Reagan Justice Department official and former chief counsel of the Senate Intelligence Committee , to get his story out ",0
"Sitting down with The Hill earlier , Toensing said that the last time her client tried to speak out “ both his reputation and liberty ” were “ threatened ” by the Obama administration in a effort to force his silence ",1
"“ All of the information about this corruption has not come out , ” she said in an interview Tuesday ",0
"“ And so my client , the same part of my client that made him go into the FBI in the first place , says , ‘ This is wrong ",0
What should I do about it?’ ” ,0
Toensing said she also possesses memos that recount how the Justice Department last year threatened her client when he attempted to file a lawsuit that could have drawn attention to the Russian corruption during the 2016 presidential race as well as helped him recover some of the money Russians stole from him through kickbacks during the FBI probe ,1
"The undercover client witnessed “ a lot of bribery going on around the U.S. ” but was asked by the FBI to sign a nondisclosure agreement ( NDA ) that prevents him from revealing what he knows to Congress , Toensing explained ",0
"When he tried to bring some of the allegations to light in the lawsuit last year , “ the Obama Justice Department threatened him with loss of freedom ",1
"They said they would bring a criminal case against him for violating an NDA , ” she added ",0
Emails obtained by The Hill show that a civil attorney working with the former undercover witness described the pressure the Justice Department exerted to keep the client from disclosing to a federal court what he knew last summer ,0
"“ The government was taking a very harsh position that threatened both your reputation and liberty , ” the civil lawyer wrote in one email ",1

"Subsequently , the Russian government sought to purchase Uranium One but required approval from the Obama administration given the strategic importance of the uranium assets ",0
"In the run - up to the approval of the deal by the State Department , nine shareholders of Uranium One just happened to make $ 145 mm in donations to the Clinton Foundation ",0
"Moreover , the New Yorker confirmed that Bill Clinton received $ 500,000 in speaking fees from a Russian investment bank , with ties to the Kremlin , around the same time ",0
"Needless to say , the State Department approved the deal giving Russia ownership of 20 % of U.S. uranium assets ",0

9 Steps to Successfully Counter Jihad ,0
By Jamie Glazov ,0
"While the Obama administration continues to allow the Muslim Brotherhood to direct American foreign policy and , therefore , to implement “ strategies ” that render America defenseless in the face of Jihad and stealth Jihad , there are some alternative strategies that have the potential to turn this catastrophic situation around completely in America ’s favor ",1
"Below are 9 concrete steps that , if implemented by a future American administration , would make a big difference in preserving our civilization and in defending Americans from terrorism : ",1
1,0
Label the Enemy and Make a Threat Assessment ,0
"The Obama administration continues to refuse to label our enemy and , therefore , it continues to enable our defeat in the terror war ",1
It is urgent that we name our enemy ( i.e. ,1
Islamic Jihad ) and definitively identify what ideology inspires our enemy ( i.e. ,1
Islamic law ) ,1
2,0
Scrap “ Countering Violent Extremism ,1
” ,0
“ Countering Violent Extremism ” is the pathetic and destructive focus of the Obama administration in allegedly fighting the terror war ,1
"On the one hand , this “ focus ” is vague to the point of being meaningless and completely incapacitates us ",1
"On the other hand , this focus allows the administration to perpetuate the destructive fantasy that there are other types of “ extremists ” — who just happen to be the Left ’s political opponents — that pose a great threat to the country ",1
"For example , as Stephen Coughlin has revealed , the “ violent extremists ” the administration is clearly worried about are the “ right - wing Islamophobes ” whom the administration obviously considers to be the real threat to American security ",1
The “ Countering Violent Extremism ” is trash and needs to be thrown in the garbage ,1
3,0
Stop “ Partnering ” With Muslim Brotherhood Front Groups ,0
"The government needs to stop cooperating with , and listening to , Muslim Brotherhood front groups such as CAIR and ISNA immediately ",0
"The Muslim Brotherhood document , the Explanatory Memorandum , has made it clear that the Brotherhood ’s objective is to destroy our civilization from within by our own hands with the influence of these groups ",1
"Moreover , as Robert Spencer advises , there needs to be legislation that will bar all such groups and affiliated individuals from advising the government or receiving any grants from it ",1
4,0
Implement a Concrete “ Countering - Jihad ” Strategy ,1
"After discarding the “ Countering Violent Extremism ” absurdity , a concrete Counter - Jihad strategy must become an official policy ",1
It must specifically register that Jihadists are the enemies and that Islamic law ( Sharia ) is what specifically motivates them ,1
"Most importantly , as Sebastian Gorka urges in Defeating Jihad : The Winnable War , the government needs to lay down a vision , an actual “ threat doctrine analysis ” in a thorough document , just like George Kennan ’s Long Telegram and NSC-68 did in laying out the strategic foundation to fighting communism in the Cold War ",1
It is absolutely mind - boggling that nothing of this sort exists today in our terror war — and it is a reflection of the Left being in charge and of the destructive defeat that it is sowing ,1
5,0
Launch Our Own Counter - propaganda Campaign ,0
The Left and Islamists engage in propaganda 24/7 ,0
What does our propaganda war entail ? ,0
Zilch ,1
"Sebastian Gorka is crucially correct , therefore , when he recommends a national counter - propaganda campaign that involves a two - part approach : the first being the bolstering of efforts to define our enemy ( Steps # 1 and # 4 above ) and , second , the strengthening of our allies and partners in their own counter - propaganda efforts – which must include our empowering of Muslims who are trying to form an anti - Jihadist version of Islam ",1
"Consequently , educational programs have to be set up everywhere , from public schools to universities to workplaces , in businesses and numerous other institutions ",0
These programs must crystallize what exactly Islamic Law is and how it inspires and sanctions violence against unbelievers ,1
"This has to also involve , as Gorka urges , “ a nationwide program of education that includes the armed services as well as federal , state , and local police forces and the intelligence community ",0
” ,0
"The education campaign must also focus on the second part of Gorka ’s counter - propaganda campaign , which is to help strengthen Muslims who seek to seize Islam from the jihadists’ hands ",1
6,0
Affirm Sharia ’s Assault on the U.S. Constitution as Seditious ,0
"Once the truth is accepted that jihadis are inspired and sanctioned by their Islamic texts , it must logically become required that mosques , Islamic schools and groups have to immediately curtail any teaching that motivates sedition , violence , and hatred of unbelievers ( i.e. ",1
remember how CAIR advised Muslims not to talk to the FBI ) ,0
"Indeed , once the government discerns and labels the elements of Islamic law that threaten the American Constitution , any preaching and spreading of those elements in America must be labelled as seditious ",0
7,0
"Put Pressure on Mosques , Islamic Groups and Schools ",0
Authorities have to start subjecting mosques and other Islamic institutions to surveillance — and discard the suicidal leftist notion that it is “ racist ” and Islamophobic to do so ,1
Islamic institutions have to be made to buffer their lip - service against terror with actually doing something about it ,1
"As Robert Spencer counsels , this has to involve introducing programs that teach against jihadists’ understanding of Islam — and these programs have to be regularly monitored by the government ",1
( This will be a part of Gorka ’s suggested counter - propaganda campaign discussed in Step # 5 ) ,0
"Spencer rightly stresses that the paradigm has to become that Muslim communities have to win the “ trust ” of intelligence and law enforcement agents , rather than the other way around , which is , absurdly and tragically , the case right now ",1
8,0
Bring Counter - Jihadists into the Government ,1
Instead of having Muslim Brotherhood sympathizers like Mohamed Elibiary serving on the U.S. ,0
"Homeland Security Advisory Council ( he “ resigned ” in Sept. 2014 under mysterious circumstances ) , and Muslim Brotherhood - linked individuals like Huma Abedin serving as the right - hand woman of Hillary Clinton , we need to bring in people who actually love America and want to protect it ",1
We all know who these noble and courageous individuals are – and some of them are referenced in this article ,1
The government must also bring in brave Muslim individuals who genuinely reject Jihad and empower them in propagating their anti - jihadist vision for Islam ,1
( P.S. ,0
"Yes , there is an argument to be made that Islam can not be Islam without Jihad ",1
But the debate over this belongs in another forum ,0
"And whatever the answer , it does not mean that the effort to empower Muslims who want to make the anti - jihadist Islamic vision possible should not be made ",0
) ,0
9,0
Ridicule the Enemy ,0
Ridicule is a vicious and potent weapon ,1
"There is a baffling and shameful silence in our culture ’s sphere of comedy , especially in Hollywood and our media , with regard to the myriad ingredients of Sharia and Jihad that merit at least a million hilarious satirical sketches ",1
"Bill Maher , for whatever unappealing drawbacks he has in conservatives’ eyes , has set a bold standard in this respect in his Burka Fashion Show skit ",0
American comedians need to start writing scripts that follow in Maher ’s footsteps and Americans need to encourage and equip them to do so – and to also vigorously defend them from the attacks and slanders they will inevitably receive from totalitarian leftist and Islamic forces ,1
We must never underestimate the crippling effect of comedy on the totalitarian Mullahs of the world ,1
"Indeed , the contemptuous , snickering and roaring laughter of people , as they gaze at the pathetic rules and lives of Sharia ’s gatekeepers , poses a danger to tyrants like no other ",1
"Jamie Glazov holds a Ph.D. in History with a specialty in Russian , U.S. and Canadian foreign policy ",0
"He is the editor of Frontpagemag.com , the author of the critically - acclaimed , United in Hate : The Left ’s Romance with Tyranny and Terror , and the host of the web - tv show , The Glazov Gang ",0

Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills : ‘ The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’ ,1
"Outside of specialists and seekers , the only reason why there is general interest in the Qur’an among non - Muslims is to seek an answer to the question of whether or not it justifies and encourages Islamic terrorism ",1
"With What the Qur’an Meant : And Why It Matters , religion author Garry Wills is here to reassure us : ",0
What did the scripture of Islam tell me about the duty to kill infidels ? ,1
"Some people are sure it is there , though it is n’t ",0
Then what does it say about Shari’ah law ? ,0
Not a thing ( p. 7 ) ,0
"That would be good to know , were Wills a reliable witness ",0
"Unfortunately , he proves to be just the opposite : Wills laments “ Robert Spencer of Jihad Watch calling for a ban on the Qur’an ” ( p. 58 ) ",0
"I have never called for such a ban , and oppose in principle the banning of any book ",0
"Wills , not surprisingly , does not offer any quotation from me to back up his false claim ",0
His manifest unreliability on this point casts a shadow on his primary assertions about the Qur’an ,0
"Wills seems determined to put the best possible face on the Qur’an , which requires him to ignore a great deal of Qur’anic incitement and hatred ",1
"For example , he quotes 5:51 -- “ You who believe , do not take the Jews and Christians as allies ” ( p. 114 ) -- but he nonetheless concludes , after ten pages of tu quoque arguments and other legerdemain , that “ the Qur’an is fraternal in its treatment of other faiths ” ( p. 124 ) ",1
"Wills never mentions Qur’an 9:29 , which commands Muslims to wage war against Jews and Christians and subjugate them as inferiors under the rule of Sharia ",1
Wills is no more trustworthy when he deals with the question of violence in the Qur’an ,0
"He renders one key passage in this way : “ Fight then until there is no more persecution , and worship [ at the shrine ] is devoted to God ” ( 2:193 ; p. 133 ) ",0
Whence the bracketed interpolation “ at the shrine ” ? ,0
Wills does n’t give any source for it ; apparently it comes from none other than Garry Wills himself ,0
"By adding “ at the shrine ” to this verse , Wills restricts the call to fight to the area around the Sacred Mosque in Mecca ",0
He ignores the fact that some Islamic authorities see this passage as calling for nothing less than unlimited warfare against non - Muslims ,0
The prominent Twentieth Century Indian Islamic scholar Muhammad Ashiq Ilahi Bulandshahri explains the passage this way : ,0
"The worst of sins are Infidelity ( Kufr ) and Polytheism ( shirk ) which constitute rebellion against Allah , The Creator ",1
"To eradicate these , Muslims are required to wage war until there exists none of it in the world , and the only religion is that of Allah ",1
"Wills does n’t mention the existence of such interpretations , even to dismiss them ",0
"Likewise , when he claims that the Qur’an has “ not a thing ” to say about Sharia , he appears unaware that the Qur’an is one of the sources of Sharia ",0
"The Qur’an ’s declarations that a woman ’s testimony is worth half that of a man ’s ( 2:282 ) , that a daughter is to receive a smaller part of an inheritance than a son receives ( 4:11 ) , that thieves are to have their hands amputated ( 5:38 ) , and that those who “ wage war against Allah and his messenger ” are to be crucified or have a hand and foot amputated on opposite sides ( 5:33 ) are part of Sharia in all its various expressions ",0
"Because these stipulations are found in the Qur’an , they can not be questioned or set aside ",0
"Throughout his book , Wills’ assurances that the Qur’an is not really as bad as “ right - wing Islamophobes ” say , or that the Bible contains material that is just as bad or worse , dissolve under close scrutiny ",1
Again and again it turns out that Wills has ignored key passages in order to make his case ,0
He asks why the Qur’an is “ so ferocious to ‘ hypocrites’ and apostates ” ( p. 124 ) ,1
Then he offers a quotation from the New Testament Letter to the Hebrews saying that “ if we sin again on purpose ” there is “ only a terrifying judgment to come ” ( p. 126 ) ,1
"Wills concludes : “ The Qur’an is not as absolute as this , because it always leaves room for God ’s inexhaustible mercy and forgiveness ” ( p. 126 ) ",0
"That sounds wonderful , and certainly pleasing to multicultural ears to learn that the Qur’an is more merciful than the New Testament ",0
"Until one realizes that , in his discussion of apostasy in the Qur’an , Wills has omitted all mention of the primary Qur’anic passage on this topic : ",0

"Wills’ naïve , inaccurate , misleadingly sunny view of the Qur’an , of course , accords with that of his fellow Leftist Catholic , Pope Francis ",1
Francis has proclaimedpreposterously that “ authentic Islam and the proper reading of the Koran are opposed to every form of violence ,0
” Wills’ book accords well with the present - day Catholic Church ’s head - in - the - sand posture toward Qur’an - based Islamic jihad violence and the Muslim persecution of the ancient Christian communities of the Middle East ,0
"It is n’t remotely accurate , but it feels good , and for the Catholic and Leftist establishment today , that seems to be all that matters ",0

Homeschooling Protects Children from Violence and Marxism ,0
"The February mass shooting at a high school in Parkland , Florida prompted many parents to consider homeschooling ",1
"This is hardly surprising , as the misnamed federal “ Gun - Free Schools ” law leaves schoolchildren defenseless against mass shooters ",1
Removing one ’s children from government schools seems a rational response to school shootings ,1
School shootings are not the only form of violence causing more parents to consider homeschooling ,1
Many potential homeschooling parents are concerned about the failure of school administrators to effectively protect children from bullying by other students ,1
"Of course , many parents choose homeschooling as a means of protecting their children from federal education “ reforms ” such as Common Core ",1
Other parents are motivated by a desire to protect their children from the cultural Marxism that has infiltrated many schools ,1

The spread of cultural Marxism has contributed to the dumbing down of public education ,0
Too many government schools are more concerned with promoting political correctness than ensuring that students receive a good education ,0
"Even if cultural Marxism did not dumb down education , concerns that government schools are indoctrinating children with beliefs that conflict with parents’ political , social , and even religious beliefs would motivate many families to homeschool ",1
"Even when government schools are not intentionally promoting cultural Marxism or other left - wing ideologies , they are still implicitly biased toward big government ",0
"For example , how many government schools teach the Austrian economics explanation for the Great Depression — much less question the wisdom of central banking — or critically examine the justifications for America ’s hyper - interventionist foreign policy ? ",0
Parents interested in providing their children with a quality education emphasizing the ideas of liberty should consider looking into my homeschooling curriculum ,0
"The Ron Paul Curriculum provides students with a well - rounded education that includes rigorous programs in history , mathematics , and the physical and natural sciences ",0
The curriculum also provides instruction in personal finance ,0
Students can develop superior oral and verbal communication skills via intensive writing and public speaking courses ,0
Another feature of my curriculum is that it provides students the opportunity to create and run their own internet businesses ,0
"The government and history sections of the curriculum emphasize Austrian economics , libertarian political theory , and the history of liberty ",0
"However , unlike government schools , my curriculum never puts ideological indoctrination ahead of education ",1
"While government schools — and even many private schools — pretend religion played no significant role in history , my curriculum addresses the crucial role religion played in the development of Western civilization ",0
"However , the materials are drafted in such a way that any Christian , Jewish , Muslim , or atheist parent can feel comfortable using the curriculum ",0
Interactive forums allow students to engage with and learn from each other ,0
The forums ensure students are actively engaged in their education as well as give them an opportunity to interact with their peers outside of a formal setting ,0
"Concern about the safety of students in government - run schools is one reason many parents are considering homeschooling , but it is not the only reason ",0
Many parents are motivated by a desire to give their children something better than a curriculum that has been dumbed down by federal initiatives like Common Core ,1
"Other parents do not wish to have their children indoctrinated with views that contradict the parents’ political , social , or even religious beliefs ",1
I encourage all parents looking at alternatives to government schools —alternatives that provide children with a well - rounded education that introduces them to the history and ideas of liberty — to go to RonPaulCurriculum.com for more information about my homeschooling program ,0

Student organizers boot SNL writer from stage during standup routine for jokes deemed offensive ,0
"Saturday Night Live writer and comedian Nimesh Patel was pulled from the stage by event organizers after telling jokes that were criticized as racist and homophobic during his performance at cultureSHOCK : Reclaim , an event held by Columbia Asian American Alliance on Friday night ",0
"Patel , 32 , was the first Indian - American writer for SNL , and has since been nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing ",0
Patel has previously performed on Late Night with Seth Meyers and opened for comedians such as Chris Rock ,0
"During the event , Patel ’s performance featured commentary on his experience living in a diverse area of New York City — including a joke about a gay , black man in his neighborhood — which AAA officials deemed inappropriate ",0
"Patel joked that being gay can not be a choice because “ no one looks in the mirror and thinks , ‘ this black thing is too easy , let me just add another thing to it.’ ” ",1
"About 30 minutes into Patel ’s set , members of AAA interrupted the performance , denounced his jokes about racial identities and sexual orientation , and provided him with a few moments for closing remarks ",0
"Compared to his other jokes , ones specifically targeting sexual orientation audibly receive less laughter from the crowd ",0
"Patel pushed back on the officials’ remarks , and said that while he stood in solidarity with Asian American identities , none of his remarks were offensive , and he was exposing the audience to ideas that would be found “ in the real world ",1
"” Before he could finish , Patel ’s microphone was cut from off - stage , and he proceeded to leave ",0
"cultureSHOCK , an annual charity showcase featuring a fashion show , productions by various student groups and a famous performer , aims to provide a platform for Asian American artistic expression and breakthrough harmful stereotypes ",0
Neither Patel and nor AAA could immediately be reached for comment ,0
"Adam Warren , CC ‘ 22 , was in the audience Friday night ",0
"Warren said that AAA made the right decision to remove Patel from the stage due to the nature of his jokes , which contradicted the sensitive nature of the event itself ",0
"“ The message they were trying to send with the event was opposite to the jokes he was making , and using people ’s ethnicity as the crux of his jokes could be funny but still offensive ... He definitely was n’t the most crass comedian I ’ve ever heard but for the event it was inappropriate , ” Warren said ",1
"However , audience member Elle Ferguson , BC ‘ 22 , said that while comedians can push the boundaries of social culture , she had heard similar jokes before and did not find them offensive ",0
"“ While what some of the things that he said might have been a bit provoking to some of the audience , as someone who watches comedy a lot , none of them were jokes that I had n’t heard before and none of them were jokes that elicited such a response in my experience , ” Ferguson said ",0
“ [ AAA ] should have talked to him beforehand especially because comedy is known for being ground - breaking and for pushing boundaries ,0
” ,0
"For Sofia Jao , BC ‘ 22 , problems with the performance resided not in the set , but with Patel ’s closing remarks ",0
“ I really dislike when people who are older say that our generation needs to be exposed to the real world ,0
"Obviously the world is not a safe space but just accepting that it ’s not and continuing to perpetuate the un - safeness of it … is saying that it ca n’t be changed , ” said Jao ",0
"“ When older generations say you need to stop being so sensitive , it ’s like undermining what our generation is trying to do in accepting others and making it safer ",0

Facebook Bans Outline to Stop Jihadi Attacks on Americans ,1
"[ Editors ' note : To best understand why Facebook would ban Jamie Glazov on 9/11 for his article on how to best prevent more 9/11s , pre - order Jamie 's new book , Jihadist Psychopath : How He Is Charming , Seducing , and Devouring Us : HERE ",1
The book illustrates how the Jihadist Psychopath has successfully built his totalitarian plantation -- on which many in the West are now enslaved and dutifully following his orders ,1
"Jamie outlines the frameworks of this tyrannical plantation and how those who are trapped on it , and yearn for freedom , can best escape ",1
] ,0
Reprinted from WND.com ,0
Somewhere in the “ community standards ” that Facebook demands everyone follow is a real doozy ,1
The social - media company has told author and commentator Jamie Glazov that their standards forbid his article about how to prevent jihadi attacks on Americans ,1
"It ’s all about Glazov ’s new book , “ Jihadist Psychopath : How He Is Charming , Seducing , and Devouring Us ",1
” ,0
"At FrontPage Magazine , where he is editor , he had posted “ 9 Steps to Successfully Counter Jihad , ” which included recommendations such as “ Label the enemy and make a threat assessment ” and “ Stop ‘ partnering’ with Muslim Brotherhood front groups ",0
” ,0
"That apparently was too much for Facebook , which declared “ only you can see this post ” because it “ goes against our Community Standards ",0
” ,0
"He was suspended from Facebook for 30 days on Sept. 11 , the anniversary of the Islamic jihadist attack on America that killed nearly 3,000 ",1
"Glazov told Breitbart , “ This is really getting surreal in the creepiest and most harrowing Stalinist sense ",1
” ,0
FrontPage Magazine reported : ,0
"Facebook ’s Unholy Alliance masters are , without doubt , accelerating their totalitarian suffocation of free thought and expression ",1
"It is no surprise , therefore , that Frontpage ’s editor , and host of ‘ The Glazov Gang,’ was suspended from Facebook for 30 days yesterday , on September 11 , after posting his article , ‘ 9 Steps to Successfully Counter Jihad.’ Glazov believed that the article was more relevant and urgent than ever due to the skyrocketing jihadist stabbings in Europe — and to the 17th anniversary of 9/11 that was approaching the next day ",1
The report said it appears “ that daring to give suggestions on how our civilization can stop jihadist attacks and another 9/11 is against Facebook ’s ‘ community standards ,1
"“ Glazov ’s advice also involves the promotion of supporting moderate Muslims – a move that is , clearly , horrifying to Facebook ’s masters and therefore also violates their ‘ community standards , ' ” the report said ",1
"No doubt , Glazov ’s consistent campaigning on behalf of Muslim women and girls in his efforts to protect them from FGM , honor killings and other Shariah barbarities , has gained him the anger and hatred of Facebook ’s guardians — who are clearly on the side of the Shariah enforcers and oppressors of Muslim women and girls ",1
The report recalls that Facebook censored Glazov in April for posting screenshots of a Muslim ’s threat to him ,0
"Twitter also lashed out at him for quoting directly from Islamic religious texts , citing its anti-“hate ” policies ",1
"It is ‘ hateful conduct,’ apparently , to reference what Islamic texts themselves say ",1
"Indeed , Frontpage ’s editor had simply referred to Sahih Bukhari ’s texts discussing Mohammed ’s marriage to Aisha when she was six years old ( 7.62.88 ) and to Quranic Suras that mandate the Hijab for women ( 24:31 ; 33:59 ) and sanction sexual slavery ( 4:3 ; 33:50 ) ",0
Facebook also refused to respond to Glazov ’s inquiry about “ what it is specifically that violates Facebook ’s ‘ community standards’ when a person gives advice on how to best defend American lives from jihad ,1
” ,0
"Glazov has written about the subject in previous books , including “ High Noon for America : The Coming Showdown ” and “ United in Hate ",0
” ,0
"In his “ 9 Steps ” article , he points out that the Obama administration was “ cooperating with , and listening to , Muslim Brotherhood front groups such as CAIR and ISNA ",0
” ,0
"The government needs , he said , to “ implement a concrete ‘ countering - jihad’ strategy ",1
” ,0
And he said it needs to affirm “ Shariah ’s assault on the U.S. Constitution as seditious ,1
” ,0
"A last key point , the said , is to ridicule the enemy ",0
Ridicule is a vicious and potent weapon ,1
"There is a baffling and shameful silence in our culture ’s sphere of comedy , especially in Hollywood and our media , with regard to the myriad ingredients of Shariah and jihad that merit at least a million hilarious satirical sketches ",1
"Bill Maher , for whatever unappealing drawbacks he has in conservatives’ eyes , has set a bold standard in this respect in his Burka Fashion Show skit ",0
American comedians need to start writing scripts that follow in Maher ’s footsteps and Americans need to encourage and equip them to do so – and to also vigorously defend them from the attacks and slanders they will inevitably receive from totalitarian leftist and Islamic forces ,1
"Bishop Morlino Targets ‘ Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church , Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus ",0
"Editor ’s Note : Over the years , Bishop Robert Morlino of the Diocese of Madison has confirmed several of my children according to the traditional Rite of Confirmation , as his diocese has been a port in the storm for many displaced and disillusioned Catholic families ",1
"We do n’t see eye - to - eye on everything , of course , but his faith and pastoral solicitude have for us been a light in the darkness and proof that God has not left us orphans ",1
"And now this , finally , a bishop with the courage to look the beast in the eye and speak its name out loud ",1
"Bishop Morlino does this in a moment when he is under heavy attack as a “ hater ” for defending the Church ’s teaching on marriage — an attack , by the way , which prompted us here at The Remnant to join the fight to DEFEND BISHOP MORLINO last year ",1

It is an act of love to hate sin and to call others to turn away from sin ,1
– Bishop Robert Morlino ,0
This is what a courageous shepherd looks like ! ,1
"In our opinion , during the most vile clergy sex scandal in history , every bishop in the country must do exactly what Bishop Morlino has done , i.e. , issue a statement of fidelity to the Church ’s moral theology , specifically her teaching against the mortal sin of homosexual acts ",1
"In so doing , the bishops will incur the wrath of the enemies of the Church , yes ",1
"They will be crucified in the media , yes ",1
But they will also be doing their sacred duty before God in reassuring their thoroughly scandalized flocks that they are absolutely committed to the defense and enforcement of the Church ’s moral teaching at a time when it is under scurrilous attack from within ,1
Nothing less will do ,1
"Bishop Morlino has now done it , and we respectfully demand that the rest of the American bishops either follow suit or face the charge of being complicit with the degenerate and even criminal shepherds , accounts of whose betrayal and vice now dominate the news ",1

Bishop Robert C. Morlino 's letter to the faithful on the ongoing sexual abuse crisis in the Church ,0
"August 18 , 2018 ",0
"Dear brothers and sisters in Christ of the Diocese of Madison , ",0
"The past weeks have brought a great deal of scandal , justified anger , and a call for answers and action by many faithful Catholics here in the U.S. and overseas , directed at the Church hierarchy regarding sexual sins by bishops , priests , and even cardinals ",0
Still more anger is rightly directed at those who have been complicit in keeping some of these serious sins from coming to light ,0
For my part — and I know I am not alone — I am tired of this ,1
"I am tired of people being hurt , gravely hurt ! ",1
I am tired of the obfuscation of truth ,0
I am tired of sin ,1
"And , as one who has tried — despite my many imperfections — to lay down my life for Christ and His Church , I am tired of the regular violation of sacred duties by those entrusted with immense responsibility from the Lord for the care of His people ",1
"The stories being brought into light and displayed in gruesome detail with regard to some priests , religious , and now even those in places of highest leadership , are sickening ",1
"Hearing even one of these stories is , quite literally , enough to make someone sick ",1
But my own sickness at the stories is quickly put into perspective when I recall the fact that many individuals have lived through them for years ,1
"For them , these are not stories , they are indeed realities ",0
"To them I turn and say , again , I am sorry for what you have suffered and what you continue to suffer in your mind and in your heart ",0
"If you have not already done so , I beg you to reach out , as hard as that may be , and seek help to begin to heal ",0
"Also , if you ’ve been hurt by a priest of our diocese , I encourage you to come forward , to make a report to law enforcement and to our Victim ’s Assistance Coordinator , so that we might begin , with you as an individual , to try and set things right to the greatest extent possible ",0
There is nothing about these stories that is okay ,0
"These actions , committed by more than a few , can only be classified as evil , evil that cries out for justice and sin that must be cast out from our Church ",1
"Faced with stories of the depravity of sinners within the Church , I have been tempted to despair ",0
And why ? ,0
The reality of sin — even sin in the Church — is nothing new ,0
"We are a Church made of sinners , but we are sinners called to sanctity ",0
So what is new ? ,0
"What is new is the seeming acceptance of sin by some in the Church , and the apparent efforts to cover over sin by them and others ",0
"Unless and until we take seriously our call to sanctity , we , as an institution and as individuals , will continue to suffer the “ wages of sin ",1
” ,0
For too long we have diminished the reality of sin — we have refused to call a sin a sin — and we have excused sin in the name of a mistaken notion of mercy ,1
"In our efforts to be open to the world we have become all too willing to abandon the Way , the Truth , and the Life ",0
In order to avoid causing offense we offer to ourselves and to others niceties and human consolation ,0
Why do we do this ? ,1
Is it out of an earnest desire to display a misguided sense of being “ pastoral ? ” Have we covered over the truth out of fear ? ,1
Are we afraid of being disliked by people in this world ? ,1
Or are we afraid of being called hypocrites because we are not striving tirelessly for holiness in our own lives ? ,1
"Perhaps these are the reasons , but perhaps it is more or less complex than this ",0
"In the end , the excuses do not matter ",1
We must be done with sin ,1
It must be rooted out and again considered unacceptable ,1
Love sinners ? ,0
Yes ,0
Accept true repentance ? ,0
Yes ,0
But do not say sin is okay ,0
"And do not pretend that grave violations of office and of trust come without grave , lasting consequences ",0
"For the Church , the crisis we face is not limited to the McCarrick affair , or the Pennsylvania Grand Jury Report , or anything else that may come ",0
The deeper crisis that must be addressed is the license for sin to have a home in individuals at every level of the Church ,1
"There is a certain comfort level with sin that has come to pervade our teaching , our preaching , our decision making , and our very way of living ",0
"If you ’ll permit me , what the Church needs now is more hatred ! ",1
"As I have said previously , St. Thomas Aquinas said that hatred of wickedness actually belongs to the virtue of charity ",0
"As the Book of Proverbs says “ My mouth shall meditate truth , and my lips shall hate wickedness ( Prov ",0
8:7 ) ,0
” It is an act of love to hate sin and to call others to turn away from sin ,1
"There must be no room left , no refuge for sin — either within our own lives , or within the lives of our communities ",0
"To be a refuge for sinners ( which we should be ) , the Church must be a place where sinners can turn to be reconciled ",0
In this I speak of all sin ,0
"But to be clear , in the specific situations at hand , we are talking about deviant sexual — almost exclusively homosexual — acts by clerics ",0
"We ’re also talking about homosexual propositions and abuses against seminarians and young priests by powerful priests , bishops , and cardinals ",1
"We are talking about acts and actions which are not only in violation of the sacred promises made by some , in short , sacrilege , but also are in violation of the natural moral law for all ",1
To call it anything else would be deceitful and would only ignore the problem further ,0
There has been a great deal of effort to keep separate acts which fall under the category of now - culturally - acceptable acts of homosexuality from the publically - deplorable acts of pedophilia ,1
"That is to say , until recently the problems of the Church have been painted purely as problems of pedophilia — this despite clear evidence to the contrary ",0
It is time to be honest that the problems are both and they are more ,0
"To fall into the trap of parsing problems according to what society might find acceptable or unacceptable is ignoring the fact that the Church has never held ANY of it to be acceptable — neither the abuse of children , nor any use of one ’s sexuality outside of the marital relationship , nor the sin of sodomy , nor the entering of clerics into intimate sexual relationships at all , nor the abuse and coercion by those with authority ",0
"In this last regard , special mention should be made of the most notorious and highest in ranking case , that being the allegations of former - Cardinal Theodore McCarrick ’s ( oft - rumored , now very public ) sexual sins , predation , and abuse of power ",1
"The well - documented details of this case are disgraceful and seriously scandalous , as is any covering up of such appalling actions by other Church leaders who knew about it based on solid evidence ",1
"While recent credible accusations of child sexual abuse by Archbishop McCarrick have brought a whole slew of issues to light , long - ignored was the issue of abuse of his power for the sake of homosexual gratification ",1
It is time to admit that there is a homosexual subculture within the hierarchy of the Catholic Church that is wreaking great devastation in the vineyard of the Lord ,1
"The Church ’s teaching is clear that the homosexual inclination is not in itself sinful , but it is intrinsically disordered in a way that renders any man stably afflicted by it unfit to be a priest ",0
"And the decision to act upon this disordered inclination is a sin so grave that it cries out to heaven for vengeance , especially when it involves preying upon the young or the vulnerable ",1
Such wickedness should be hated with a perfect hatred ,1
Christian charity itself demands that we should hate wickedness just as we love goodness ,0
"But while hating the sin , we must never hate the sinner , who is called to conversion , penance , and renewed communion with Christ and His Church , through His inexhaustible mercy ",0
"At the same time , however , the love and mercy which we are called to have even for the worst of sinners does not exclude holding them accountable for their actions through a punishment proportionate to the gravity of their offense ",0
"In fact , a just punishment is an important work of love and mercy , because , while it serves primarily as retribution for the offense committed , it also offers the guilty party an opportunity to make expiation for his sin in this life ( if he willingly accepts his punishment ) , thus sparing him worse punishment in the life to come ",1
"Motivated , therefore , by love and concern for souls , I stand with those calling for justice to be done upon the guilty ",0
"The sins and crimes of McCarrick , and of far too many others in the Church , bring suspicion and mistrust upon many good and virtuous priests , bishops , and cardinals , and suspicion and mistrust upon many great and respectable seminaries and so many holy and faithful seminarians ",1
The result of the first instance of mistrust harms the Church and the very good work we do in Christ ’s name ,0
"It causes others to sin in their thoughts , words , and deeds — which is the very definition of scandal ",0
"And the second mistrust harms the future of the Church , since our future priests are at stake ",0
I said that I was tempted to despair in light of all of this ,0
"However , that temptation quickly passed , thanks be to God ",0
"No matter how large the problem , we know that we are called to go forward in faith , to rely upon God ’s promises to us , and to work hard to make every bit of difference we can , within our spheres of influence ",0
"I have recently had the opportunity to talk directly with our seminarians about these very pressing matters , and I have begun to , and will continue to , talk with the priests of the diocese , as well as the faithful , in person and through my weekly column and homilies , making things as clear as I can , from my perspective ",0
"Here now , I offer a few thoughts to those of my diocese : ",0
"In the first place , we must continue to build upon the good work which we have accomplished in protecting the youth and vulnerable of our diocese ",0
"This is a work on which we can never rest in our vigilance , nor our efforts to improve ",0
"We must continue in our work of education for all and hold to the effective policies that have been implemented , requiring psychological exams for all candidates for ministry , as well as across - the - board background checks for anyone working with children or vulnerable individuals ",0
"Here again , I state , as we have done consistently , if you have knowledge of any sort of criminal abuse of children by someone in the Church , contact law enforcement ",0
If you need help in contacting law enforcement contact our Victim ’s Assistance Coordinator and she will help connect you with the best resources ,0
"If you are an adult victim of sexual abuse from childhood , we still encourage you to reach out to law enforcement first , but even if you do n’t want to , please still reach out to us ",0
"To our seminarians : If you are unchastely propositioned , abused , or threatened ( no matter by whom ) , or if you directly witness unchaste behavior , report it to me and to the seminary rector ",0
I will address it swiftly and vigorously ,1
I will not stand for this in my diocese or anywhere I send men for formation ,0
"I trust that the seminaries I choose , very discriminately , to help form our men will not ignore this type of scandalous behavior , and I will continue to verify that expectation ",1
"To our priests : Most simply , live out the promises you made on your ordination day ",0
"You are called to serve Christ ’s people , beginning with praying daily the Liturgy of the Hours ",0
This is to keep you very close to God ,0
"In addition , you promised to obey and be loyal to your bishop ",0
"In obedience , strive to live out your priesthood as a holy priest , a hard working priest , and a pure and happy priest — as Christ Himself is calling you to do ",1
"And by extension , live a chaste and celibate life so that you can completely give your life to Christ , the Church , and the people whom he has called you to serve ",0
God will give you the graces to do so ,0
Ask Him for the help you need daily and throughout every day ,0
"And if you are unchastely propositioned , abused , or threatened ( no matter by whom ) , or if you directly witness unchaste behavior , report it to me ",0
I will not stand for this in my diocese any more than in our seminaries ,0
"To the faithful of the diocese : If you are the victim of abuse of any kind by a priest , bishop , cardinal , or any employee of the Church , bring it forward ",0
It will be addressed quickly and justly ,0
"If you have directly witnessed sexual advances or any type of abuse , bring it forward as well ",0
Such actions are sinful and scandalous and we can not allow anyone to use their position or power to abuse another person ,1
"Again , in addition to injuring individuals , these actions injure the very Body of Christ , His Church ",1
"Furthermore , I add my name to those calling for real and sustained reform in the episcopate , priesthood , our parishes , schools , universities , and seminaries that would root out and hold accountable any would - be sexual predator or accomplice ; ",0
"I will hold the priests of the diocese to their promise to live a chaste and celibate life of service to you and your parish , and evidence of failure in this regard will be justly addressed ; ",0
I will likewise hold every man studying for the priesthood for our diocese accountable to living a chaste and celibate life as part of his formation for the priesthood ,0
Failure to do so will lead to dismissal from diocesan sponsorship ; ,1
"I will continue to require ( with our men and our funds ) that all seminaries to which we send men to study be vigilant that seminarians are protected from sexual predators and provide an atmosphere conducive to their holistic formation as holy priests , in the image of Christ ; ",0
"I ask all the faithful of the diocese to assist in keeping us accountable to civil authorities , the faithful in the pews , and to God Almighty , not only to protect children and the youth from sexual predators in the Church , but our seminarians , university students , and all the faithful as well ",0
"I promise to put any victim and their sufferings before that of the personal and professional reputation of a priest , or any Church employee , guilty of abuse ; ",0
I ask everyone reading this to pray ,0
Pray earnestly for the Church and all her ministers ,0
Pray for our seminarians ,0
And pray for yourselves and your families ,1
"We must all work daily on our own personal holiness and hold ourselves accountable first and , in turn , hold our brothers and sisters accountable as well , and ",1
"Finally , I ask you all to join me and the entire clergy of the Diocese of Madison in making public and private acts of reparation to the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus and to the Immaculate Heart of Mary for all the sins of sexual depravity committed by members of the clergy and episcopacy ",0
"I will be offering a public Mass of reparation on Friday , September 14 , the Feast of the Triumph of the Holy Cross , at Holy Name Heights and I ask all pastors to do the same in their own parishes ",1
"In addition , I ask that all priests , clergy , religious , and diocesan employees join me in observing the upcoming Autumn Ember Days ( Sep. 19 , 21 , and 22 ) as days of fasting and abstinence in reparation for the sins and outrages committed by members of the clergy and episcopacy and I invite all the faithful to do the same ",1
"Some sins , like some demons , can only be driven out by prayer and fasting ",0
"This letter and these statements and promises are not intended to be an exhaustive list of what we can and need to do in the Church to begin to heal from , and stave off , this deep illness in the Church , but rather the next steps I believe we can take locally ",1
"More than anything else , we as a Church must cease our acceptance of sin and evil ",0
We must cast out sin from our own lives and run toward holiness ,1
We must refuse to be silent in the face of sin and evil in our families and communities and we must demand from our pastors — myself included — that they themselves are striving day in and day out for holiness ,0
We must do this always with loving respect for individuals but with a clear understanding that true love can never exist without truth ,0
"Again , right now there is a lot of justified anger and passion coming from many holy and faithful lay people and clerics across the country , calling for real reform and “ house cleaning ” of this type of depravity ",0
I stand with them ,0
I do n’t know yet how this will play out nationally or internationally ,0
"But I do know this , and I make this my last point and last promise , for the Diocese of Madison : “ As for me and my household , we will serve the Lord ",1
” ,0
"Faithfully yours in the Lord , ",0

"At the same time , Gainer released the names of 71 clergy and seminarians who 've been credibly accused of sexual misconduct involving children dating back to 1947 , apologized on behalf of the diocese and himself , waived any confidentiality agreements abuse survivors may have signed in legal settlements with the diocese , and released new guidelines for protecting children in the church ",0
"Grainer said he wanted to release the list of accused predators earlier but was asked to wait until a state grand jury inquiry into abuse in six Pennsylvania Catholic diocese , including Harrisburg , was complete ",0
"A spokesman for Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro , who ordered the two - year investigation of Catholic sex abuse , said the Harrisburg diocese had pushed to end the grand jury investigation last year ",0
"The grand jury 's findings , including allegations against more than 300 priests accused of sexual abuse dating back to 1947 , will likely be released this month after the state Supreme Court gave the green light ",0
"The Catholic Church is already reeling over the revelations that former Washington Archbishop Theodore McCormick , who resigned as a cardinal over the weekend after being sanctioned by Pope Francis , has been credibly accused of sexually abusing at least two boys decades ago ",1

ICE Arrests Over 150 in Bay Area ,0
"Immigrations and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) arrested more than 150 illegals in the San Francisco Bay Area this week -- no thanks to the Democrat mayor of Oakland , who tried to warn the constituents of her sanctuary city of impending ICE raids ",1
"Fox News reports that “ targeted immigration enforcement operations ” resulted in the arrests , about half of which snared fugitives with convictions for assault and battery , crimes against children , weapons charges and DUI ",0
One such fugitive is a documented gang member whose “ accumulated criminal convictions in California ... have resulted in more than 15 years of prison sentencings ” and who had previously been removed by ICE four times ,0
Many of the other arrested illegals had criminal convictions from Mexico and Guatemala throughout Northern California ,0
"The arrests came despite a press release tweeted by Libby Schaaf , the Democratic mayor of Oakland , which noted that “ multiple credible sources ” told her ICE would be conducting the raids in the Bay Area ",1
This did not win her any friends among law enforcement ,0
"ICE Deputy Director Thomas Homan said in a statement Tuesday , ",0
The Oakland mayor ’s decision to publicize her suspicions about ICE operations further increased that risk for my officers and alerted criminal aliens — making clear that this reckless decision was based on her political agenda ,1
"Unlike the politicians who attempt to undermine ICE ’s critical mission , our officers will continue to fulfill their sworn duty to protect public safety ",1
"True to the left 's support for criminality over law and order , Mayor Schaaf declared that she considered it her """""""" duty """""""" to warn criminal illegals in her area ",1
Fox News notes that ICE officials are asking the Department of Justice to look into whether she broke any laws by doing so ,0
"ICE reports that 864 illegal immigrants with criminal convictions and other public safety threats """""""" remain at large """""""" in the area -- an indeterminate number of whom may have been tipped off by a Democrat mayor who betrayed the law - abiding citizens of Northern California ",1

Sanctuary City Mayor Protected Illegal Alien Mexican Rapist ,1
Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf claims to fight for women ,0
Except when she 's fighting for their rapists instead ,1
A Democratic mayor ’s warning to illegal immigrants of an incoming ICE raid in northern California may have led to a number of illegal immigrants with violent and sex - related convictions evading capture and deportation ,1
"Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf tweeted out an impending warning of the four - day raid last week , alerting targeted individuals to the imminent arrests , and infuriating Immigrations and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) officials , who say that many more could have been caught if they had n't been warned ",0
A spokesperson for ICE gave Fox News examples of some of the unsavory characters who evaded officals during the raid ,1
"One Mexican citizen had convictions for unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor and a conviction for driving under the influence ( DUI ) , and had been deported in 2003 ",0

Israel Takes On the Shia Crescent ,0
"Despite Israel 's repeated warnings , Barack Obama 's reckless appeasement of the Iranian regime has enabled its rise as a hegemonic threat in the Middle East region as well as a threat to international peace and security ",1
"In 2009 , Obama turned his back on millions of dissidents in the streets of Tehran and other Iranian cities , who were peacefully protesting the rigged election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as president ",1
"In 2011 , Obama precipitously removed the remaining U.S. combat troops from Iraq , giving rise to ISIS ’s re - emergence in Iraq from its bases in Syria ",1
"The radical Shiite Iranian regime purported to come to the “ rescue ” of both countries from the Sunni terrorists , turning Iraq into a virtual vassal state of the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the process ",1
"Obama 's disastrous nuclear deal with Iran legitimized Iran 's path to eventually becoming a nuclear - armed state , while immediately filling its coffers with billions of dollars to fund its aggression ",1
"Meanwhile , Syria has become ground zero for Iran 's execution of its regional ambitions , which is to establish its Shiite Crescent connecting with its allies , including Iraq , Syria and Lebanon ",0
"This plan has included the establishment of a land route that Iranian - backed militias secured in June , beginning on Iran ’s border with Iraq and running across Iraq and Syria all the way to Syria ’s Mediterranean coast ",0
"This road makes Iran ’s job easier in supplying arms by land , as well as by air and sea , to prop up Syrian President Bashar al - Assad ’s regime and to equip Iran ’s own forces fighting inside of Syria in support of Assad ",0
"This helps explain why Iran has placed so much importance on helping the Syrian regime establish control over the Deir ez - Zor area in eastern Syria , near the Iraqi border ",0
"“ Everything depends now on the Americans’ willingness to stop this , ” said an Iraqi Kurdish official who was quoted in a New Yorker article ",0
"However , U.S .- led coalition forces apparently have done next to nothing to stop this major advance in Iran ’s Shiite Crescent expansion ",0
"“ Obama ran down our options in Syria so thoroughly , by the time this administration took over , ” said Andrew Tabler , senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy ",0
"“ The Iranian influence is spreading because they are so heavily involved in regime activities , ” Tabler added ",0
“ It ’s a new monster ,1
” ,1
"Furthermore , Iran has funded and armed its terrorist proxy Hezbollah , which has sent its militia from its home base of Lebanon to fight alongside Assad 's forces ",0
And Iran has used Syria as a transit point for shipment of sophisticated rockets to Hezbollah in Lebanon for future use against Israeli population centers ,0
"Despite the fact that Hezbollah has American blood on its hands , the U.S .- led coalition has chosen not to do anything about Hezbollah ’s presence in Syria , bought and paid for by Iran ",1
"While Israel chose not to take sides in Syria 's civil war with military intervention of its own , it has bombed weapons storage facilities and convoys inside Syria for its own protection ",0
"Just recently , on September 7th , Israeli jets struck a Syrian weapons facility near Masyaf , which was reported to have been used for the production of chemical weapons and the storage of missiles ",0
"Israel will also do what is necessary to repel Iranian - backed forces if they edge too close to areas near the Golan Heights , shrinking the buffer between Israel and Iranian controlled territories ",0
"However , such tactical measures may not be enough to thwart Iran ’s larger ambitions ",0
"In light of intelligence reports that Assad may be ready to invite Iran to set up military bases in Syria , Israeli leaders have concluded that they can not wait until the Trump administration decides to deal more forcefully with Iran 's growing use of Syria as a staging area for carrying out its expansionist Shiite Crescent strategy ",0
"“ Their overriding concern in Syria is the free reign that all the major players there seem willing to afford Iran and its various proxies in the country , ” wrote Jonathan Spyer in an article for Foreign Policy ",0
"As long as nobody else is addressing the concern Iran ’s growing control raises in a satisfactory manner , “ Israel is determined to continue addressing it on its own ",0
” ,0
"At least , Israel has a more sympathetic ear in the Trump administration than it did in the Obama administration for raising its concerns about Iran ’s growing threat , not only to Israel but to U.S. interests in the region and beyond ",0
President Trump ’s sharp denunciation of the Iranian regime during his address to the UN General Assembly represented a welcome departure from the Obama administration ’s milquetoast approach to Iran ,1
"As the U.S .- led coalition continues to drive ISIS from its bases of operation in Syria , the Trump administration has proclaimed its intention not to allow Iran to turn Syria into its own satellite , as Iran has essentially done in Iraq ",0
National Security Adviser H.R. ,0
McMaster said that the “ so called liberation of areas by Assad ’s forces and Iranian proxies could actually accelerate the cycle of violence and perpetuate conflict rather than get us to a sustainable outcome ,1
"” He claimed that the Trump administration ’s “ objectives are to weaken Iranian influence across the region broadly , ” without discussing the means to accomplish those objectives ",0
Whether the Trump administration follows through remains to be seen ,1
"In the meantime , Israel will have to deal with the fallout of Iran ’s ambitions in Syria itself ",0
Pope admits Catholic Church has ‘ long ignored’ problem of child abuse ,0
"VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis on Monday asked forgiveness for child abuse crimes and cover - ups within the Catholic Church , admitting that the pain of victims “ was long ignored , kept quiet or silenced ",0
” ,0
"The strongly worded statement came ahead of an Aug. 25 - 26 papal pilgrimage to Ireland , one of the countries rocked by clergy sex abuse scandals , and followed an expose of pedophile priests in the U.S. ",1
"“ The heart - wrenching pain of these victims , which cries out to heaven , was long ignored , kept quiet or silenced , ” Francis said in a Letter to the People of God , a rarely - issued address to the world ’s 1.3 billion Catholics ",1
"On Aug. 17 , a Pennsylvania grand jury report , based on hidden archives of the U.S. church , named 301 priests from the state as credibly accused child sex abusers and accused church leaders of a systematic cover - up of their crimes ",1
"The report “ detailed the experiences of at least a thousand survivors , victims of sexual abuse , the abuse of power and of conscience at the hands of priests over a period of approximately seventy years , ” Francis acknowledged ",0
"“ It is essential that we , as a Church , be able to acknowledge and condemn , with sorrow and shame , the atrocities perpetrated by consecrated persons , clerics , and all those entrusted with the mission of watching over and caring for those most vulnerable , ” he said ",1
"“ Let us beg forgiveness for our own sins and the sins of others , ” he added ",0
"In the run - up to Francis’ visit to Ireland , the head of the Irish Catholic Church , Archbishop Eamon Martin , said he expected the pope to meet with victims of clergy sex abuse and to promise effective remedies ",0
"“ I ’m not sure what his words will be and I ’m not sure that a simple apology is what survivors of abuse want , ” Martin said in a BBC interview ",1
"“ If he expresses an apology , it needs to be more than ‘ we ’re sorry,’ ” he added ",1
"In his letter , Francis repeated a famous 2005 quote by his predecessor Benedict XVI , who , a month before being elected pope , lamented “ how much filth ” there was in the Catholic Church ",1
"“ With shame and repentance , we acknowledge as an ecclesial community that we were not where we should have been , that we did not act in a timely manner , realizing the magnitude and the gravity of the damage done to so many lives ",1
"We showed no care for the little ones ; we abandoned them , ” Francis said ",1
"“ Looking back to the past , no effort to beg pardon and to seek to repair the harm done will ever be sufficient ",1
"Looking ahead to the future , no effort must be spared to create a culture able to prevent such situations from happening , but also to prevent the possibility of their being covered up and perpetuated , ” he added ",0
"Colm O’Gorman , an Irish abuse survivor who founded One in Four , the main survivors’ group in Ireland , commented on Twitter that the pope offered “ Much stronger language than ever used before ",0
” ,0
"But O’Gorman added : “ ( The pope ) begs for forgiveness , but still does not admit or own the deliberate policy of cover up designed & implemented by the # Vatican ",1
” ,0
"Like his predecessor , Francis has promised “ zero tolerance ” on child abuse , but scandals have kept recurring in several parts of the world — including in Australia recently ",1
"In January , the pope was accused of insensitivity and tone - deafness after insisting , during a visit to Chile , that local abuse survivors had no “ proof ” against a bishop who allegedly witnessed abuse and failed to report it ",0
"Following an outcry , Francis apologized for his remarks , held private meetings with victims at the Vatican , and , after envoys he sent to Chile backed up victims’ claims , the entire leadership of the Chilean Catholic church tendered their resignations ",1
"According to church expert John L Allen , an editor at specialized website Crux.com , the Catholic Church has a structural problem when it comes to dealing with cover up accusations ",1
"“ Sixteen years since the crisis first erupted in the U.S. , almost ten years since that happened in Ireland , and now more than five years since Francis was elected , the Catholic Church still has no credible , transparent process for handling cases when the accusation against a bishop is n’t the direct commission of abuse but rather covering up someone else ’s crimes , ” Allen said in a Sunday column ",1

DOJ Unseals Indictment Involving Uranium One Scandal ,0
This report was originally published by Tyler Durden at Zero Hedge ,0
The Department of Justice unsealed an 11-count indictment on Friday to a former DoD intelligence analyst - turned uranium transportation executive who stands accused of a bribery and money laundering scheme involving a Russian nuclear official connected to the Uranium One deal ,0
The indictment corroborates a November report by The Hill that an FBI mole deeply embedded in the Russian uranium industry had gathered extensive evidence of the scheme ,0
"Mark Lambert , 54 , of Mount Airy , Maryland , was charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ( FCPA ) and to commit wire fraud , seven counts of violating the FCPA , two counts of wire fraud and one count of international promotion money laundering ",0
"The charges stem from an alleged scheme to bribe Vadim Mikerin , a Russian official at JSC Techsnabexport ( TENEX ) , a subsidiary of Russia ’s State Atomic Energy Corporation and the sole supplier and exporter of Russian Federation uranium and uranium enrichment services to nuclear power companies worldwide , in order to secure contracts with TENEX ",0
"According to the indictment , beginning at least as early as 2009 and continuing until October 2014 , Lambert conspired with others at “ Transportation Corporation A ” to make corrupt and fraudulent bribery and kickback payments to offshore bank accounts associated with shell companies , at the direction of , and for the benefit of , a Russian official , Vadim Mikerin , in order to secure improper business advantages and obtain and retain business with TENEX ",1
–DOJ ,0
"While the indictment lists Lambert ’s company as “ Transportation Corporation A , ” a simple search reveals that Lambert is the co - President of DAHER - TLI , “ the leading front end freight forwarding company dedicated to Nuclear Cargo , ” according to its website ",0
"In 2012 , the Nuclear Regulatory Commission sent a letter to Lambert with findings that TLI had exported plutonium “ in excess of the maximum quantity and type applied for and licensed , ” and “ exported Australian obligated material , which was not authorized under license conditions ",0
” ,0
"Prior to his 26 year tenure in the transportation industry – 20 of which have been with TLI , Mr. Lambert was an Arabic Linguist for the Navy for five years , and a Senior Intel Analyst for the Department of Defense ( DoD ) for three years ",1
"Lambert also speaks fluent Arabic and Farsi ( Persian ) , along with French and Italian ",1
The indictment against Lambert corroborates prior reporting by The Hill that an FBI mole buried deep within the Russian nuclear industry had gathered extensive evidence of a scheme involving bribes and kickbacks between Russian nuclear officials and TLI – which would have transported the U.S. uranium sold to Russia in the ’20 percent’ Uranium One deal ,0
"“ The Russians were compromising American contractors in the nuclear industry with kickbacks and extortion threats , all of which raised legitimate national security concerns ",1
"And none of that evidence got aired before the Obama administration made those decisions , ” a person who worked on the case told The Hill , speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by U.S. or Russian officials ",0
” ,0
Based on what the FBI knew – including evidence which purportedly includes a video of Russians preparing briefcases of bribe money – the Uranium One deal never should have gone through ,0
"Moreover , both Robert Mueller and current deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein were directly involved – and current Attorney General Jeff Sessions and other Justice Department officials appear to be covering for them ",0
"In short , the FBI had ample evidence of the Russian bribery plot before the Obama administration approved the Uranium One deal thanks to their embedded mole in the Russian nuclear industry ",0
"The informant – outed as energy consultant William Campbell – was “ threatened ” by Obama admin AG Loretta Lynch to keep quiet with an iron - clad gag order , according to his attorney – former Reagan Justice Dept ",1
official and former Chief Counsel to the Senate Intelligence Committee Victoria Toensing ,0
"After Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley ( R - VA ) demanded Campbell be allowed to testify in front of Congress , the gag order was lifted ",0
"Attorney General Jeff Sessions originally tried to claim that there was no connection between Uranium One and the nuclear transport bribery case , however several congressional republicans pushed back : ",0
"“ Attorney General Sessions seemed to say that the bribery , racketeering and money laundering offenses involving Tenex ’s Vadim Mikerin occurred after the approval of the Uranium One deal by the Obama administration ",0
"But we know that the FBI ’s confidential informant was actively compiling incriminating evidence as far back as 2009 , ” Rep. Ron DeSantis , ( R - Fla ",0
) told The Hill ,0
“ It is hard to fathom how such a transaction could have been approved without the existence of the underlying corruption being disclosed ,0
"I hope AG Sessions gets briefed about the CI and gives the Uranium One case the scrutiny it deserves , ” added DeSantis , whose House Oversight and Government Reform subcommittees is one of the investigating panels ",0
"Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley ( R - Iowa ) sent a similar rebuke last week to Rosenstein , saying the deputy attorney general ’s first response to the committee “ largely missed the point ” of the congressional investigations ",0
"“ The essential question is whether the Obama Justice Department provided notice of the criminal activity of certain officials before the CFIUS approval of the Uranium One deal and other government decisions that enabled the Russians to trade nuclear materials in the U.S , ” Grassley scolded ",0
” ,0
"Meanwhile , journalists John Solomon and journalist Sara Carter claim to have copies of the FBI informant ’s evidence , while Carter issued an explosive report in late November laying out the players , the timeline , and the evidence at hand ",0
"“ By the time the sale of Uranium One was approved by the Obama Administration , the FBI ’s investigators had already gathered substantial evidence and the bureau was also aware of Russia ’s intentions to enter the U.S. energy market and its desire to purchase a stake in American uranium , ” Carter writes ",0
Highlights : ,0
"FBI mole William Campbell was a highly valued FBI asset – paid $ 51,000 by FBI officials at a celebration dinner in Chrystal City , VA , where Campbell ’s attorney says they thanked him for his service ",0
"Campbell was required by the Russians , under threat , to launder large sums of money – which allowed the FBI to uncover a massive Russian “ nuclear money laundering apparatus ” ",0
"Campbell collected over 5,000 documents and briefs over a six year period ",0

Uranium One Informant Breaks Silence : Moscow Paid Millions To Influence Hillary Clinton ,0
"The President , Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States , shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for , and Conviction of , Treason , Bribery , or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors ",0
"-Article 2 , Section 4 of the US Constitution ",0
"Right off the bat , this appears to be clear bribery , and a case could be made for treason ",0
"However , it is now being reported that an FBI informant that was involved in the Uranium One deal , has told congressional committees that Moscow paid lobbyists to influence then - Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by helping former President Bill Clinton ’s charities during the Obama administration ",0
The Hill 's John Solomon reported on Wednesday : ,0
"The informant , Douglas Campbell , said in the statement obtained by The Hill that he was told by Russian nuclear executives that Moscow had hired the American lobbying firm APCO Worldwide specifically because it was in position to influence the Obama administration , and more specifically Hillary Clinton ",0
... Campbell added in the testimony that Russian nuclear officials “ told me at various times that they expected APCO to apply a portion of the $ 3 million annual lobbying fee it was receiving from the Russians to provide in - kind support for the Clintons ' Global Initiative ,0
""""""""" ",0
"“ The contract called for four payments of $ 750,000 over twelve months ",0
APCO was expected to give assistance free of charge to the Clinton Global Initiative as part of their effort to create a favorable environment to ensure the Obama administration made affirmative decisions on everything from Uranium One to the U.S .- Russia Civilian Nuclear Cooperation agreement ,0
""""""""" ",0
"APCO officials told The Hill that its support for the Clinton Global Initiative and its work with Russia were not connected in any way , and in fact involved different divisions of the firm ",0
They added their lobbying for Russia did not involve Uranium One but rather focused on regulatory issues aimed at helping Russia better compete for nuclear fuel contracts inside the United States ,0
"In case you are unfamiliar with Uranium One , it is a Canadian mining company whose sale to a Russian firm was approved in 2010 ",0
"The sale gave the Russians control of part of the US uranium supply , thus why I reference a case could be made for treason ",0
"While Democrats have unsurprisingly questioned Campbell 's credibility , Campbell 's attorney Victoria Toensing told Sean Hannity , “ [ The Russians ] were so confident that they told Mr. Campbell with the Clinton ’s help , it was a shoo - in to get CFIUS [ The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States ] approval ",0
They were so confident in that that they even had him open up the new office because they were planning on the kind of business they were going to do as soon as CFIUS approved it ,0

"In a lengthy report by Award - winning National Security / War Correspondent Sara Carter , she pointed out that following : ",0
"On Wednesday , he shared with the committee information he provided to the FBI and has in the past described his frustration with the Obama administration ’s failure to stop Russia ’s nuclear giant from purchasing 20 percent of American uranium mining assets ",0
"Campbell testified before numerous Congressional investigators that his extensive counterintelligence work on Russia and stated that during his time as an informant , he obtained information that Russia was continuing to aid the Iranian government ",0
"According to Campbell Russia provided the resources necessary for the nation ’s nuclear reactors , despite promises that they were not sharing such technology with Iran ",0
"In an April 16 , 2010 , summary brief provided to his former FBI handlers and obtained by this reporter , he stressed his deep concerns about Tenex , a wholly owned subsidiary of the Russian state nuclear arm Rosatom and its ongoing work to provide Iran with the technology needed for its nuclear reactor program ",0
"At the time , Rosatom was seeking the approval to purchase the Canadian mining company Uranium One ",0
"“ TENEX continues to supply Iran with fuel through their Russian company TVEL , ” stated Campbell in a 2010 brief provided to the FBI ",0
TVEL is a Russian nuclear fuel cycle company headquartered in Moscow ,0
“ They ( TVEL ) continue to assist with construction consult and fabricated assemblies to supply the reactor ,0
Fabricated assemblies require sophisticated engineering and are arranged inside the reactor with the help and consult of TVEL ,0
"” Campbell informed the FBI of the close relationship between TVEL and TENEX , both a part of the Rosatom group ",0
"He stated in his brief that while spending time with the Russian executives from both Rosatom and Tenex , that any mention of “ TVEL is a subject that is serious to all when mentioned ",0
"I do not even raise the subject of TVEL to our friends , but occasionally they speak of it and always in a guarded manner ",0
"” In the briefs , he informed the FBI that “ occasionally someone will mention having been in Iran but usually it is long after the fact ",0
"” And when he asked the Russians about these connections , he stated that they “ occasionally speak of the relationship , i.e. ",0
"equipment , consulting ",0
"I asked Vadim ( Mikerin ) if they felt there was a serious problem , and would they adhere to sanctions and western opinion ",0
His response was a smile and shoulder shrug ,0
"” But Campbell had provided the FBI with evidence of the criminal network and delivered the information to the FBI , which was monitoring his work as an informant and approving his transfer of bribery money to the Russians ",0
"Those transfers , which were made in bulk $ 50,000 sums and at times delivered in cash , occurred between senior executives of the American transportation company and the Russian executives connected to Rosatom ",0
"He had given the FBI irrefutable evidence showing how contracts obtained from the same Russian energy company Tenex , were based on contract bribery and other nefarious actions , he said ",0
"Senior members of the FBI , Department of Treasury , Department of Energy and Department of Justice were also briefed on Campbell ’s information and were apprised of the various facets pertaining to Russia ’s acquisition of the Canadian company ",0
"In fact , Campbell had been told by his FBI handlers that his work had made it at least twice into President Obama ’s classified presidential daily briefings ",0
"Of course , we know what Obama did with his daily briefings ",1

"In order to effectuate and conceal the corrupt and fraudulent bribe payments , Lambert and others allegedly caused fake invoices to be prepared , purportedly from TENEX to Transportation Corporation A , that described services that were never provided , and then Lambert and others caused Transportation Corporation A to wire the corrupt payments for those purported services to shell companies in Latvia , Cyprus and Switzerland ",1
"Lambert and others also allegedly used code words like “ lucky figures , ” “ LF , ” “ lucky numbers , ” and “ cake ” to describe the payments in emails to the Russian official at his personal email account ",0
"The indictment also alleges that Lambert and others caused Transportation Corporation A to overbill TENEX by building the cost of the corrupt payments into their invoices , and TENEX thus overpaid for Transportation Corporation A ’s services ",0
"In June 2015 , Lambert ’s former co - president , Daren Condrey , pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate the FCPA and commit wire fraud , and Vadim Mikerin pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering involving violations of the FCPA ",0

Facebook Lifts Frontpage Editor Jamie Glazov ’s 9/11 Ban ,0
"[ Editors ' note : To best understand why Facebook would ban Jamie Glazov on 9/11 in the first place , pre - order Jamie 's new book , Jihadist Psychopath : How He Is Charming , Seducing , and Devouring Us : HERE ",1
"The book illustrates how the Jihadist Psychopath has , with the help of the Left , successfully built his totalitarian plantation in the West -- on which the political and cultural establishment is now enslaved and dutifully following his orders ",1
"Jamie outlines the frameworks of this tyrannical plantation and how those who are trapped on it , and yearn for freedom , can best escape ",1
] ,0
"Frontpage editors are happy to announce our free speech victory : Facebook has lifted Frontpage editor Jamie Glazov 's 30-day ban on Facebook , apologizing and saying that the block was a “ mistake ” ",1
"We have no doubt , of course , that no “ mistake ” had actually occurred in this matter and that the ban has only been lifted because of the publicity that we engaged in -- and received ",1
"While it is a positive development that Facebook has lifted the ban on Jamie ( for now ) , this story is crucial to amplify now more than ever , seeing that Facebook , and all of leftist - run social media , is , at this moment , clearly accelerating its totalitarian attack on the free speech of conservatives ",1
( See Jamie 's video on this whole surreal affair HERE ) ,1
"A brief recap of Jamie 's story : on Sept. 11 , the 17th Anniversary of the 9/11 terror strike , Facebook 's Unholy Alliance masters informed Jamie that he was suspended from Facebook for 30 days due to his posting of his article , 9 Steps to Successfully Counter Jihad , which Facebook informed him violated their """""""" community standards ",1
""""""""" ",0
"This suggested , of course , that giving advice on how to prevent another 9/11 , and all other Jihadist attacks against America , is now against Facebook ’s ‘ community standards’ ",1
( Read the whole story HERE ,0
) ,0
Frontpage and Jamie immediately publicized this tyrannical behavior of Facebook ,1
"Then , yesterday , on Sept. 13 , Facebook notified Jamie that it had made a mistake and that it was lifting his block ",0
It goes without saying that this retraction and surrender by Facebook occurred only because of the wide publicity that Jamie 's banning had received ,1
"And we are immensely grateful for all the massive support that was given to us across the Internet , including especially from Breitbart , PJMedia , WorldNetDaily and Thomas Lifson at American Thinker ",1
"Leading brave conservative figures such as Michelle Malkin and Laura Loomer also stood up for Jamie , tweeting about his ban -- and to them we send our heartfelt appreciation ",1
"Jamie is , of course , no stranger to social media censorship -- especially of the insane variety ",1
"The Counter Jihad Coalition 's ( CJC ) Facebook page , which Jamie helped run with CJC President Steve Amundson , was removed a few years ago with absolutely no explanation ",1
The CJC is a human rights and pro - national security group that is dedicated to protecting America and the West from Jihad -- and Muslim and non - Muslim people from Sharia oppression ,0
"The question remains : why would Facebook remove such a page , let alone in such a fascistic manner -- and never explain why ? ",1
"In April earlier this year , Jamie was suspended from Facebook for posting screenshots of a Muslim 's threat to him on the platform ",0
"Then , in May , his Twitter account was temporarily suspended and he was forced to delete tweets he posted which directly quoted Islamic religious texts ",0
His account was suspended for violating Twitter ’s rules relating to “ hateful conduct ,1
"” It is """""""" hateful conduct """""""" , apparently , to reference what Islamic texts themselves say ",1
"Indeed , Frontpage 's editor had simply referred to Sahih Bukhari ’s texts discussing Mohammed ’s marriage to Aisha when she was six years old ( 7.62.88 ) and to Qur'anic Suras that mandate the Hijab for women ( 24:31 ; 33:59 ) and sanction sexual slavery ( 4:3 ; 33:50 ) ",0
"One thing we know for sure is that , despite this lifting of Jamie ’s ban , Facebook and the leftist totalitarians in other social media venues and in the culture at large will continue their unrelenting effort to suffocate dissent and conservative voices ",1
"On Facebook , many brave conservative truth - tellers continue to be censored in myriad ways ; these individuals include Anni Cyrus , Bosch Fawstin , Mark Lutchman and , of course , Diamond & Silk ",1
The case of # WalkAway leader Brandon Straka is especially disturbing : he was recently banned by Facebook for the crime of announcing that he would be interviewed by Alex Jones ,1
"Prager U has had its videos mysteriously disappear off of Facebook and then , only after vociferous protest , re - appear ",1
"Facebook is , of course , just one terrain of this leftist brownshirt - style assault on free speech ",1
"Everyone knows by now , for instance , what has happened , in the most Orwellian sense , to Alex Jones and InfoWars on Facebook , YouTube and Twitter ",0
"Leading scholar of Islam and JihadWatch.org Director Robert Spencer , meanwhile , is not just a target at Facebook , where his referrals are down 90 % from what they once were ; he has been banned by Patreon at the behest of MasterCard -- and MasterCard has yet to respond to his lawyer ’s letter ",0
GoFundMe has also banned Spencer because of a smear by the Southern Poverty Law Center ( SPLC ) hate machine ,1
"Speaking of Mastercard , the David Horowitz Freedom Center just recently won a major battle with the credit card , defeating well - financed leftwing groups that are trying to run the Center out of business and suffocate free speech in America ",1
"The Freedom Center emerged victorious , but it is clear that leftist hate groups such as the SPLC and Color of Change.org are preparing new attacks against the Freedom Center and other conservative groups and individuals 24/7 ",1
"To be sure , the Left 's attacks on the David Horowitz Freedom Center continue unabated : just recently a hit piece in the Washington Post smeared a stand - up noble gentleman like Florida Gubernatorial Candidate Republican Ron DeSantis , libeling David Horowitz in the process ",1
"The article stated falsely and maliciously that Horowitz 's Restoration Weekend , that DeSantis had attended , was somehow “ a racially charged event ” -- a vicious lie that Frontpage has exposed and for which the Washington Post is still to apologize and issue a retraction ",1
"( To learn why David Horowitz is one of the central targets of the Left , make sure to watch this video ) ",0
"Thus , we clearly gauge that there is no disgusting and venomous level to which the Left will not stoop in its destructive agenda ",1
"Yes , Frontpage editor Jamie Glazov has had his ban lifted at Facebook , but this is clearly only a brief reprieve for him on that platform -- and it is only , obviously , a very tiny space in the Stalinist Left 's war on America and on everything on which it stands ",1
"At this dire moment , we all need to amplify our voices in defense of free speech ",1
And we need to adamantly defend all the truth - tellers at the very moment they come under attack ,1
We also need to contact our representatives and to call for a Congressional investigation into this pernicious assault by the fascist Left on our liberties ,1
The battle for America -- and for the West -- is on ,1
[ Editors ' postscript : Please make sure to FOLLOW Jamie Glazov on Facebook as well as on Twitter ( @JamieGlazov ) to strengthen his social media strength in the face of the Left 's vicious war on free speech ,0

Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick 's Scandal ,0
"Archbishop Bernard Hebda of St. Paul , MN , responds to the McCarrick scandal ( The Catholic Spirit ) : ",0
"Every time Mass is celebrated , the priest prays that Jesus will “ look not on our sins but on the faith of [ his ] Church … ",0
"” That ’s been an important prayer for me in the time that I have been serving this archdiocese , well aware of our sins but equally aware of the strong and vibrant faith of this local Church ",1
"I ’ve been praying that prayer even more earnestly in these past weeks as the Church in the United States has once again come face - to - face with its sins , with reports that former cardinal Theodore McCarrick , one of the most prominent Churchmen in the United States in the last quarter century , has been accused of abusing two minors and sexually harassing or assaulting a number of seminarians and young priests ",1
"To make matters worse ( if that is even possible ) , evidence has surfaced that indicates that a bishop , as well as some priests and laity , had brought the allegations about misconduct with seminarians to the attention of Church authorities but to no avail : Archbishop McCarrick was nonetheless “ promoted ” to become the archbishop in our nation ’s capital , and elevated to the College of Cardinals ",1
"While I realize that it is not always easy to evaluate the credibility of those bringing allegations , and that there ’s often a tendency to believe those we know over those we do n’t , I do n’t think that the Church in the United States will rest — and confidence will be restored — until the matter is independently investigated and explained , and assurances are given that there are safeguards in place to make sure that something like this could n’t happen again ",1
"The matter has been particularly troubling to me personally due to the fact that I had served in the Archdiocese of Newark as coadjutor archbishop from November 4 , 2013 , to March 25 , 2016 , when I was named archbishop here ",0
It was while I was in Newark that I was introduced to then - Cardinal McCarrick ,0
"A number of good Catholics have written to ask for a personal accounting on my part , inquiring whether I was made aware in my time in Newark of the 2005 and 2007 settlements involving Archbishop McCarrick , or if I knew of any allegations against him ",1
"I can state unequivocally that I learned of those settlements only in June of this year , as news broke about the unrelated claim that had been filed in the Archdiocese of New York ",0
What I know of the settlements I know from the newspapers ,0
"When serving in Newark , I was regularly briefed on current legal matters of all sorts , but not on past legal matters ( unless they were still being discussed in the press ) ",0
"By the time I arrived in Newark in November 2013 , the 2005 and 2007 settlements were apparently considered ancient history ",1
It would be untrue to state that I had never heard any allegations about Cardinal McCarrick ,0
"Years before I ever lived in Newark , and never imagining that I would be assigned there , I had indeed read — as a somewhat geeky ex - lawyer — an allegation about Cardinal McCarrick in the context of a 2005 lawsuit in the Southern District of New York against Archbishop Myers , Cardinal Eagan , Bishop Hubbard and the Irish Christian Brothers ",1
"While the complaint did n’t supply any details , the plaintiff was reported to have said to a journalist that “ Archbishop McCarrick would share a bed with seminarians but not engage in any activity with them ",0
” The complaint would later be formally amended to include that allegation ,0
"Knowing , however , that this lawsuit was completely dismissed by the state and federal courts , I never gave the particular allegation about Cardinal McCarrick any credence ",0
"I can also state without exception that no one in my years in Newark ever told me that they were improperly touched by Archbishop McCarrick , and no one ever told me that they had to share a bed with him or that they had seen anyone share a bed with him ",0
"I heard lots of gut - wrenching stories in my two - and - a - half years there , but none of them involved Archbishop McCarrick ",1
"With St. John Paul II ’s 1995 visit , he was remembered for “ bringing a saint to Newark , ” not as an abuser of seminarians , minors or priests ",1
"When I was installed here in St. Paul , he joined me at lunch along with my father , sister , godmother and then 12-year - old nephew ",0
I can assure you that I would never have allowed that to happen if I had any reason to know or even suspect the things that have been reported in the newspapers this past month ,0
"While the letters and emails of recent days are sober reminders that there ’s still a long way to go in restoring trust , I nonetheless welcome the efforts to hold me accountable to you , the faithful of this archdiocese ",1
"The events of these past weeks have shown that no one can be above the law , regardless of rank or privilege ",1
"I was grateful for the opportunity to reinforce that with our seminarians this past weekend , and I look forward to continuing my work with the Office of Ministerial Standards and Safe Environment , and our Archdiocesan Review Board , in creating a culture in which no one need be afraid or reluctant to bring forth an allegation of misconduct ",0
"Our heavenly patron , St. Paul , reminds us that “ where sin abounds , grace abounds all the more ",1
” May these difficult days be days of great grace for this local Church ,0
"REMNANT COMMENT : While we certainly appreciate His Excellency 's candid explanation of what he knew and did not know about this horrific scandal in the Church , we would also humbly beg him to take it one step further by publicly proclaiming his profession of belief in the Church 's official teaching against the mortal sin of homosexual acts and the so - called """""""" gay lifestyle , """""""" which includes her long - held teaching that homosexual activity between clerics is an ecclesiastical crime ",1
"Far from being reassured of this by their bishops , many Catholic faithful today are informed that the modern Catholic Church is now an """""""" inclusive community """""""" that """""""" welcomes all """""""" and """""""" judges none ",1
""""""""" ",0
"All very well and good , except for the fact that the Church 's constant and unchanging moral teaching on this makes no such allowance ",1
"In fact , this binding and constant teaching of the Church was reaffirmed most recently in her most authoritative modern catechism , which holds the exact opposite position from that apparently held by many bishops : ",0
"Homosexuality refers to relations between men or between women who experience an exclusive or predominant sexual attraction toward persons of the same sex ... Basing itself on Sacred Scripture , which presents homosexual acts as acts of grave depravity , tradition has always declared that """""""" homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered ",1
""""""""" ",1
They are contrary to the natural law ,1
They close the sexual act to the gift of life ,1
They do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity ,1
Under no circumstances can they be approved ,1

Under no circumstances … except for those dreamed up by a number of bishops in this country who apparently think that it should be left up to individual parishes to decide if they are LGBTQ - friendly or not ,1
"Even Pope John Paul """""""" The GREAT 's """""""" Vatican clarified the Church 's teaching on October 31 , 1986 , in the “ Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons ” : ",1
"Although the particular inclination of the homosexual person is not a sin , it is a more or less strong tendency ordered toward an intrinsic moral evil ; thus the inclination itself must be seen as an objective disorder ",1
"Therefore special concern and pastoral attention should be directed to those who have this condition , lest they be led to believe that the living out of this orientation in homosexual activity is a morally acceptable option ",1
It is not ,1
"Notice the late pope does not say , “ Let the practicing homosexuals have a spiritual home among your faithful , ” as Father James Martin and his episcopal fans are at least implying on a regular basis in the media ",1
Does Archbishop Hebda believe it is time for the Church to stop humiliating herself by stooping to accommodate a special interest group that obviously does n't care about her or the moral code by which she governs ? ,1
Does he believe that all Catholics must follow the rules of the Church pertaining to the Sixth Commandment ... or just the straight Catholics ? ,1
"Does His Excellency believe that if some homosexual Catholics feel they need not bother following the rules they should be warmly welcomed into our """""""" Catholic Christian """""""" community anyway , even if they are in same - sex unions ? ",0
Pope John Paul certainly did n't accept that ,0
"In his 2005 book Memory and Identity , John Paul referred to homosexuality as an “ ideology of evil , ” insisting of so - called ' gay marriage ' that : ",1
"“ It is legitimate and necessary to ask oneself if this is not perhaps part of a new ideology of evil , perhaps more insidious and hidden , which attempts to pit human rights against the family and man ",1
” ,0
Was Pope John Paul THE GREAT an intolerant homophobe ? ,1
"Are Father Martin and his pals in the episcopacy really so enlightened over every pope , saint , and moral theologian in history ? ",1
"Or is it not so that it is both negligent and uncharitable for some bishops to refuse to inform their faithful that according to the Church 's own infallible teaching , everlasting damnation is the price to be paid for this kind of inclusivity and toleration ? ",1
"And if the episcopal retort is going to be that this acceptance refers only to chaste homosexuals , then we call FOUL even louder since this crosses the line into willful deception ",1
"We 're all sinners , of course--- and the Church already accepts repentant homosexuals as they are , just as she accepts repentant practitioners of ANY sins of the flesh ",1
So why are our bishops playing dumb ? ,1
"Quite obviously , it is because what they are actually closing an episcopal eye to are the folks who want to keep right on sinning -- and sinning proudly ",1
This is what the Church of Accompaniment is all about ! ,1
"But , practically speaking -- in the real world -- this kind of """""""" accompaniment """""""" is only green - lighting vice and mortal sin , and as such constitutes a hideous violation of everything these bishops supposedly believe as Catholic priests ",1
So what 's going on here ? ,0
"Who are these bishops that think they can play fast and loose not only with the moral theology of the Catholic Church , but also with the immortal souls of their flock ? ",1
"Is it any wonder that priests and laity alike are changing their attitude on the """""""" gay lifestyle """""""" and violations of the Sixth Commandment when so many bishops are working to remove the stigma attached to this sin that Scripture tells us cries to heaven for vengeance ? ",1
"The Catholic Church 's new - found """""""" climate of tolerance """""""" is exactly what McCarrick and company are counting on ! ",1
"It is truly homophobic for any bishop to lie to the gay community about this , and to risk the immortal souls of the sheep merely so that the shepherd might pride himself on occupying the politically correct high ground ",1
"This is gross dereliction of duty , and we hope and pray that all the good U.S. bishops would jump at the opportunity to issue statements reaffirming the Church 's clear teaching against all sins of the flesh , homo- and heterosexual ",1
"Again , God bless Archbishop Hebda for this welcome statement , and may God grant him the courage now to finish the task by publicly reassuring the scandalized faithful that it ’s not just abuse of minors or sexual harassment that ’s going on here ",1
Our bishops must make it absolutely clear that the Church 's moral theology on homosexuality will not and can not be trumped by the dictates of political correctness ,1
"And neither can God 's law be changed to accommodate the spirit of our “ most enlightened ” age --- which is , of course , an evil spirit that can be driven out only by prayer and fasting ",1
Until the Church and her bishops get back to reaffirming traditional Catholic teaching on human sexuality we can forget about seeing an end to the sexual abuse crisis and the massive problem of homosexuality in the clergy ,1
"McCarrick will become the norm , not the exception , and confidence in the leadership and moral authority of the Catholic Church will remain in the toilet indefinitely ... exactly as the forces of darkness intended all along ",1

"No one should be surprised by the crackdown on illegals entering the country , especially since it was one of the major campaign promises Donald Trump made before getting elected ",0
"When it comes to the separation of children from their families , there is nothing new today that was not being done during the Obama reign ",0
"In 2013 , Obama began bringing into the US literally over a hundred thousand people , mainly below age 21 ",0
"They were bused , flown , and met at the US border with Mexico by the Department of Homeland Security under the direction of Obama to do so ",0
"Since most of them were adolescents and older teenagers they could not be set free , thus Obama ordered various military bases to house these children ",0

"The surge of children into the US from various countries south of the border was said to be the result of economics , high crime rates , and actual threats from organized crime entities ",0
Another excuse used by the Obama government was to bring them here to find their families already in the US ,1
"Thus , the idea that separating children from their parents as being something new , done only by the Trump Administration is absurd , since we really have no idea whether the children brought here during the Obama reign were intentionally separated from their parents by the US government at that time , or not ",1
"We have only what little information the government told us then , which was not very much , considering the fact that Obama wanted to keep as much of this situation as secret as possible ",0
"What many do not realize is , today 's policy of separating underage siblings from their parents once they cross the border illegally into the US seems to be a planned event by the US government going all the way back to the domestic military exercises known as Jade Helm in 2015 ",1
"Many remember the military taking over several Walmart locations , mainly in Texas , during the Jade Helm exercises ",0
"This , along with the federal government grab of millions of acres of land during the Obama years , speaks volumes in the government 's plan to be able to handle millions of people ",0
"Since Obama planned to have over a million Muslim refugees brought into the US over a short period of time , along with the hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants coming in , one can understand the reason the Feds had to have the Walmart stores and so much land , as they needed housing for the millions they planned to bring in ",0
"Despite President Trump signing an Executive Order suspending Syrian refugees from entering the US for 120 days on Jan. 26 , 2017 while security measures were reviewed , the US still imported 110,000 refugees from Syria and various other countries into the US in 2017 alone , up from 85,000 the previous year ",0
These numbers follow Obama 's projections of the expected amount of refugees permitted to come to the US ,0
"Of course , as with the number of illegal immigrants entering our county , the Feds downplay the actual number which always ends up to be more than quadruple their stated number ",0
What we seem to have here with the illegal immigration situation today is some very good actors on the Left accusing the Trump Administration of being cruel and insensitive with separating children from their families once they cross the Mexican border into the US ,1
"When in fact , their idol , Obama did the same thing for years during his time in power ",1
What they do not want to admit to is the fact that today 's illegal immigration picture is one that follows the Obama plan on dealing with the influx of illegals to a carbon copy ,0
"President Trump , on the other hand , is following along with it by detaining illegal immigrants at the border and separating children from their apparent families ",1
"Since no one can know if the children really belong to the illegals who say they are their parents , they are separated until that can be verified , along with other background findings ",1
"The bottom line is , both the Left and the Trump Administration seem to be following along with a plan of action going back to Jade Helm which paved the way for the housing needed for such a huge influx of illegal immigrants and refugees ",0
All of which seems to be a planned event ,0
"In any case , neither side in DC is really interested in solving the illegal immigration problem or cares about the children involved ",0
"If they were , there would be no detention and separation after illegally coming into the US , only an immediate deportation by US Border Patrol on the spot ",1

We Should Be More Like Sweden : Gov May Use Army Against Immigrant Gangs ,0
Progressives say we should be more like Sweden ,0
That means turning our country into a hopeless hellhole where the native population is overtaxed and terrorized by warring foreign gangs ,1
We 're getting there too ,0
What should we do ? ,0
Maybe we should be more like Sweden ? ,0
"Sweden will do whatever it takes , including sending in the army , to end a wave of gang violence that has seen a string of deadly shootings , Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said in Wednesday ",0

""""""""" It would not be my first option to bring in the military , but I am prepared to do whatever is necessary to make sure that serious , organized crime is stamped out , """""""" Lofven told news agency TT ",1
Bringing in the military comes in as an option ahead of cutting migration to Sweden ,1
That tells you everything ,1
Why would anyone associate rising crime and immigration ? ,0
Maybe because the gangs in question are immigrant gangs ,0
"The government has promised police an extra 7.1 billion crowns ( $ 880 million ) through 2020 , toughened laws on gun crimes and made it easier for the police to monitor private phone calls and emails , among other measures ",0

Mass repression and police powers that do n't actually address the cause of the problem ,1
Meanwhile the Grenade Amnesty does n't seem to have worked ,0
And the gang violence keeps rising ,0
But who are these gangs ? ,0
The criminal gang Loyal to Familia has already spread across Denmark from its base in the Nørrebro district of Copenhagen and now it appears to have set its sights on Sweden ,0
Swedish police told the Danish tabloid Ekstra Bladet that the gang is trying to build a presence in both Malmö and Helsingborg ,0
An expansion into Malmö could be a recipe for increased violence in light of the fact that gun violence claimed the lives of 11 people in the southern Swedish city last year ,0
"The gang 's leader , Shuaib Khan , confirmed that the group is eyeing the two Swedish cities but denied that Loyal to Familia was a “ criminal gang ” ",0

Tlaib is a vociferous foe of Israel ,0

"I will be using my position in Congress so that no country , not one , should be able to get aid from the U.S. when they still promote that kind of injustice ",1

What kind of injustice ? ,0
"Tlaib , of course , had nothing to say about the genocidal incitement against Jews and Israel that regularly features on Palestinian television ",1

"This whole idea of a two - state solution , it does n’t work ",1

Indeed it does n’t ,0
A Palestinian state would be a new base for renewed jihad attacks against Israel ,0
"But a “ one - state solution ” would be even worse , unless that state is the current State of Israel , but that is not the one state Tlaib has in mind ",0
"She is calling for an Israeli / Palestinian state that would not be a Jewish State or a homeland for the Jewish people , but a federation in which Palestinians would soon overwhelm Jews demographically ",0
"Progressive denial of their rights would soon follow : as I show in my book The History of Jihad From Muhammad to ISIS , there has never been a majority Muslim nation in which Jews enjoyed equality of rights with Muslims ",0
Tlaib ’s unitary state would be no different ,0
"The hijabed ( and therefore pro - Sharia ) Ilhan Omar , meanwhile , is even more hateful than Tlaib ",1

They officially divorced in December 2017 ,0
The motivation for the marriage remains unclear ,0
"However , the totality of the evidence points to possible immigration fraud and student loan fraud ",0
"” What ’s more , she swore to apparent falsehoods in court ",0

"She and Tlaib will enjoy establishment media accolades as they pursue their hard - Left , anti - American , anti - Israel agenda ",0

"Kuwaiti cleric Sheikh Jihad Al-‘Ayesh delivered a speech in which he said that the figure of six million Jews killed in the Holocaust was a “ historical lie , ” but that Hitler “ knew the truth about the Jews ” and therefore began “ tormenting and persecuting them ",0

"They were not banished for being Jews , ” he said ",0
"In an effort to dispute the existence of gas chambers at Auschwitz , Sheikh Al-‘Ayesh , who heads the Bait Al - Maqdis Documentary Studies Center , drew the following analogy : “ Imagine that you want to build a bakery ",0
"What size of bakery would you need to make 10,000 loaves of bread ? … What if you wanted to make 50,000 loaves of bread an hour ? ",0
You would need a larger bakery ,0

Following is a transcript : Jihad Al-‘Ayesh : “ Some people have shown up with a new fashion ,0
"We used to think that fashion has to do with haircuts , clothes , or lifestyle , but the vogue today is to sympathize with the Jews and to shed crocodile tears about their sorrows , their heresy , and their historical lies ",1
"This is , indeed , a new fashion ",1
Some esteemed people shed tears about what the Jews call ‘ the Holocaust.’ [ … ] “ Did the Nazi annihilation – the Holocaust – target only the Jews ? ,1
Anybody ? ,0
The Jews claim that it happened to them alone and that the number of Jews who died in that Holocaust was six million ,1
What we have here are historical errors ,0
"First of all , the figure of six million is a historical lie ",1
"In addition , claiming that it happened to the Jews alone excludes the non - Jews who were tortured by Hitler ",0
So was it annihilation ? ,1
"Yes , it was ",0
Who did Hitler annihilate ? ,1
"He annihilated a group of races and people , some of whom were even German ",1
"Hitler annihilated 400,000 Germans who were handicapped or suffered from chronic diseases ",1
Hitler did not annihilate the Jews only ,1
[ … ] “ Hitler was not the first in the West to perpetrate a genocide ,0
Inhuman and criminal annihilation runs in the veins of many in the West ,1
Hitler embodies one type of modern Western annihilation ,1
"When the Americans occupied the republics of the Indians , they annihilated millions of human beings ",1
"It is said that they annihilated 50 - 100 hundred million , but nobody ever mentions this ",1
[ … ] “ Was there annihilation ? ,1
Yes ,0
Many races were annihilated ,1
"The Auschwitz camp , which is in southern Poland , was a major and exceptional camp for detention , torture , and forced labor ",1
Many people were tortured and were starved to death there ,0
"[ … ] “ The Jews were banished , tortured , and annihilated because of their deeds ",1
They were not banished for being Jews ,0
"There were Jews in the Islamic countries and caliphates as well , but we never killed them just for being Jews ",0
"No , it never happened ",0
"Hitler and the Nazi state knew the truth about the Jews , and therefore , they began tormenting and persecuting them ",0
[ … ] “ That is when the Final Solution began ,0
The Nazis called it the ‘ Final Solution’ of the Jews ,0
"When we say ‘ Final Solution,’ we realize that many of the terms used by the Zionist state constitute Nazi terms , ideas , and notions ",0
It is as if they are two faces of the same coin ,0
"[ … ] “ Since Germany and Europe did not want the Jews , the Nazis came up with the idea of sending the Jews to another country ",0
"The Nazis suggested Madagascar , Ecuador , or an Arab country – Syria ",0
"But after a while , the Nazis discovered that there were groups of Jews calling for the establishment of a state ",0
They were calling for a Zionist state ,0
That is when the idea of deporting the Jews to Palestine arose … ,0
